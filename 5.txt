After all, it makes it easier for just about anyone to take the most awesome pictures, admire the best views and discover great hidden gems given the freedom and ease that it gives.''However, it’s quite easy to get nervous when you decide to go on your first road trip — especially if it is abroad! No matter how long you’ve been driving, doing so in a foreign destination can easily crawl up your nerves. But hopefully, these seven tips will make things much easier for you.''Tip #1:''Ask How To Use Your Rental Car''Don’t be afraid of looking silly! Remember that all cars are different and if you are in a country where you don’t master the language, even getting the GPS right can be tricky.''So as the car rental agency guy handles you the keys of your vehicle, ask him how the lights work, how to turn the heater or air conditioner on and off, how to use the radio or MP3, how to turn down and up the volume, etc. Besides, it’s much wiser to hit the road after a few professional tips and a brief lesson than having to learn everything as you drive!''.''Tip #2:''Know Your Way On Toll Roads''Toll roads can be tricky, especially if you don’t have many of them back at home or if you don’t use them regularly.''“Do I need a badge?”''“How do I pay?”''“What if I don’t have spare change?''Make sure you have these figured out before you arrive at a toll booth so that you are not the one to blame for holding up the queue.''.''Tip #3:''Get Car Insurance. ALWAYS.''Going on a road trip without car insurance is a recipe for disaster. If you have your own car, ask your car insurance company if your policy is valid abroad — if it is not, upgrade it as you need. Your car prime will probably be higher from now on, but remember that the expenses derived from a car accident can be difficult to afford abroad.''So once you rent a car, a''car rental damage insurance policy''is a must. You should evaluate the different options available in the market and go for the one that best suits your needs and expectations. It is very likely that you’ll discover that an independent provider will offer you the best rates and the best coverage possible.''.''Tip #4:''Know Your Route!''Google Maps''will be your best friend as you start planning your road trip. Before you set off, always pinpoint your starting point and your destination so that you can explore which route/routes you can take to get you there.''Whenever possible, try to strike a balance between those that offer stunning scenic views and highways and try to avoid those routes that are less traveled.\xa0Remember that you only need to have a basic route worked out yet you should also try to be spontaneous!''.''Tip #5:''Know The Rules Of The Road''Apart from the driving laws that you naturally should follow, make sure you are also aware of the unspoken rules that are common in your destination.''For instance, while undertaking can be a regular practice in many countries, people never do so in the United Kingdom. In other countries, drivers pay attention to and respect the red lights while in others they have a more relaxed attitude.\xa0Surely, being aware of these unwritten rules will help you feel more confident on the road.''.''Tip #6:''Find A Travel Mate''While road trips and solo travelers seem to be a combination made in heaven, having a partner in crime while on the road is never a bad idea. As long as they are someone whom you can spend lots of time with and share similar likes and preferences, you’ll certainly have someone by your side that you could share the best experiences and memories — as well as help you with any minor issue with your car (and of course, share expenses with in order to''save money while traveling'').''.''Tip #7:''Book Hotels and Attractions Ahead''It is advisable that you book hotels and attractions in advance. Some of them can be too crowded or extremely popular among fellow travelers; hence, you may have a hard time finding a vacant spot or a room in that hotel you’ve been wanting to visit for such a long time. But if you’re coming during off season, it could be worth the risk to not book anything and just wing it — it’s up to you!''How about you?''What do you think of these road trip tips?''Do you have any other tips to add?''Did you like this article?''Follow me on''Facebook'',''Twitter'',''Instagram'', or''YouTube''and be notified about my newest posts and updates!''Canada has almost always been included in lists that point out the best destinations to go to for a getaway — and that’s not surprising because it is a country that is a melting pot of various picturesque landscapes and sights that could instantly take anyone’s breath away!''Now, my brother actually lives in Canada and I haven’t had the chance to visit him for years now… (I know, shame on me!); but hopefully, I get to correct that soon.''So in preparation for my upcoming Canada adventure, I present to you Lauren, a fellow travel blogger fromCanada who will be sharing with us the\xa0top 10 things that we\xa0should know about her incredible home country.''..''BIO & INTRO''My name is Lauren, and I am Canadian.''…No, I’m not writing a narrative for a beer commercial.

For one thing, acquiring a Nepal visa is an easy and hassle-free process!''I personally had no problems acquiring a visa on arrival (VOA) in Kathmandu’s international airport, and hopefully with this visa guide, you’ll have the same experience too. I hope this helps!''.''How to Apply for a Nepal Visa on Arrival''1''Step 1: Determine if you are eligible for a Nepal visa on arrival''.''.''ALL foreigners (except Indians) need a visa for Nepal — but of course, there are various types of Nepal visa that you can apply for such as:''diplomatic visa,\xa0marriage\xa0visa, work visa, relationship visa, study visa, etc.''For this particular guide, I will''only''be discussing the requirements for a''Nepal visa on arrival for tourists/visitors''since it’s an experience that I’ve gone through myself. So for this, you must''first''determine if you are eligible in getting a ‘visa on arrival’ by reviewing the following conditions:''You have a passport that has at least six (6) months of validity from the date of your arrival in Nepal.''Your have a passport that also has at least one (1) blank page for stamping by the Immigration Officer.''(Take note, the stamp of Nepal is quite huge).''You are NOT a citizen or national of Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan; because if you are, you will NOT be granted a visa on arrival at the immigration entry points of Nepal.''(To obtain a visa, you rather have to directly apply at a Nepal Embassy or Diplomatic Mission in your country).''Once you’re sure that you ARE eligible to apply for an Nepal visa on arrival as based from the eligibility rules above, please proceed with the instructions below.''2''Step 2: Process your Nepal visa application''.''.''To date, there are''three (2) ways''to obtain a Nepal visa on arrival…''#1 – At\xa0Kathmandu’s international airport (TIA)''You simply need to prepare the following items:''Your passport\xa0(and a photocopy of the bio page too, just in case)''Application form''There are 3 ways of accomplishing this form…''Manual'': By filling out an application form at the airport. You can find sheets of this at the stands.''Machine'': The airport now has automatic registration machines wherein it will extract information after it scans your passport. I had to input some information in as well, but generally, it was fast and seamless. After that, it will take your digital photo. All in all it took me only 5 minutes to do this, so this option will save you a lot of time compared to filling the form manually.''Online, in advance'': Since 2014, tourists can fill up the form online via''this web address''. For this, it must be done within 15 days of your arrival date in Nepal. This process will need a digital version of your passport-sized photo and address details of your''hotel in Nepal''. The way I see it though, accomplishing the form at the airport is still more hassle-free.''Nepal''is a destination that is known for its grand vistas which are a mix of astounding Himalayan views, lush jungles, colorful villages, and anicent temples. As such, there is undoubtedly a''ton''of things that you can do in the country to fill up your time — but when it comes to the wildlife, nothing beats the UNESCO World Heritage site of Chitwan National Park (which is a mere 20-minute flight from the capital of Kathmandu). To date, there are a number of accommodations in this famous safari that could give anyone the opportunity to enjoy Chitwan’s rich habitat; however, the newest luxury jungle lodge of the Taj Hotels named as''Meghauli Serai''is a place that you must''not''miss out on.''I actually had the amazing chance to stay here during my visit to Chitwan last year in Nepal, and right from the first day, I easily saw how it is an opulent staycation that will be worth anyone’s time and money. In fact, I honestly don’t think that there is any other place surrounding the Chitwan National Park that could beat Meghauli Serai!''To further prove my point, below are the top 10 reasons why a stay in this luxurious jungle lodge is a MUST!''.''Top 10 Reasons to Stay in Meghauli Serai''#1''– Lush and upscale jungle safari escape''Nestled on the picturesque banks of River Rapti, Meghauli Serai is actually a newly opened safari launched just last 2016 under the popular''Taj group of hotels''.\xa0It is the first of their luxury lodges that is located outside of India; but as expected, it exudes the same signature grandeur\xa0that the group has come to be known for worldwide.''First and foremost, Meghauli Serai boasts 13 rooms, 16 pool villas and 1 presidential suite that have all been basked in earthy tones along with a distinct focus on local designs (as exemplified by the furniture and hand-painted murals not only in the rooms but in the whole property too).''To add, the lodge even has a large outdoor infinity pool that faces the jungle-scape as well as several dining area options in order for the guests to fully enjoy the surrounding terrain.''.''#2''– Perfect location right in the heart of Chitwan National Park''Like I’ve already mentioned previously, Chitwan (“Heart of the Jungle) National Park which is Nepal’s first national park is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and Meghauli Serai is perfectly smacked right on the buffer zone of this safari by the River Rapti. So naturally, it comes as no surprise that guests will often enjoy sightings of wild animals who will come drinking or bathing by the river — and come night time, their sounds will even pleasantly waft in from time to time.''TRIVIA'':''Chitwan\xa0is regarded as one of the best wildlife-viewing safaris in Asia due to its exceptional natural beauty and the number of animals that are protected within it. The most well-known of them all would be the endangered Indian Rhinoceros or ‘greater one-horned rhinoceros’ of which only 3,000 remain in the wild (and 605 are found in Chitwan alone). Other than this, there are the unique-looking Indian Gharials (crocodiles), tigers, leopards, elephants, sloth bears and various bird life.''.''#3''–\xa0Luxury rooms and suites to suit anyone’s fancy''All of Meghauli Serai’s rooms connect the guests to Chitwan’s lush nature given the uninhibited views it provides of the river and the national park.

As the oldest Hindu temple in the city, you will find a sprawling mix of temples, ashrams''(spiritual monasteries)'', images, and inscriptions from the moment that you set foot in this place.''TIP'':''If you want a unique experience, you can visit in the morning to see them do cremations or visit in the evening from 6PM to see the aarti (worship with fire).''.''★ Boudhanath:''Dominating the skyline of Kathmandu, this is a well-known stupa''(place of meditation)''in which its massive mandala''(spiritual symbol in Buddhism)''makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal.\xa0It helps to note that for centuries it\xa0has stood as a beacon of Buddhist belief and has since been an important place of meditation and pilgrimage for a lot of local Nepalis and Tibetan Buddhists.''.''Swayambhunath:''This is an ancient religious architecture that contains shrines, temples, a stupa, a Tibetan monastery, a museum, and a library — moreover, it is also surrounded by ‘holy monkeys’''(as per mythology)''which made it gain the nickname: ‘Monkey Temple’. Although this site is considered Buddhist, it remains to be revered by both Buddhist and Hindus.''TIP'':''To get a great panoramic view of the stupa, enter the Tamang Gompa monastery. Meanwhile, for a less crowded environment, it’s best to come either early in the morning or early in the evening.''.''★Durbar Square:''‘Durbar Square’ is a generic name used to describe plazas that are opposite old royal palaces in Nepal, and this particular Durbar Square in Kathmandu city is surrounded by spectacular architecture that showcases the skills of Newar''(historical inhabitants of Kathmandu Valley)''artists for centuries. Regrettably, some of the buildings here have collapsed because of the big earthquake that happened last 2015 — however, the beauty of this square remains due to its astounding palaces, courtyards and temples.''Old City:''Make sure that you explore this tangle\xa0of narrow alleys and temples that are found north and south of the central Durbar Square as one of your things to do in Kathmandu city, so that you can also get a closer look into the local’s culture and way of life.''Other Durbar Squares:''If you have the time, check out the other Durbar Squares found in the Kathmandu Valley (at Patan and Bhaktapur).''.''Garden of Dreams or Swapna Bagaicha:''If you want to find a space that is away from the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu, the serene atmosphere of the beautifully-restored neo-classical Swapna Bagaicha or Garden of Dreams will be your wanted respite. In here, you can enjoy\xa0a vast garden that has 3 pavillions, an amhitheater, ponds, urns, and pergolas (walkways).''.''Kopan Monastery:''This Tibetan Buddhist monastery near Boudhanath is primarily popular amoung foreigners for its courses on Tibetan Buddhism.

Haggle hard if you want to get a fair and good price. As a standard, aim to ask for half or a 3rd of their original quoted price.''(But if I you’re not too privy like me wherein you wouldn’t mind giving some extra help to the locals — even if they’re not being exactly fair with the price — it’s fine to skip on the bargaining.)''.''Stuff yourself with local food:''First and foremost, eat “momo”''which is a steamed dumpling that’s native to Nepal and Tibet. If you’re rather looking for a full meal option, get a “thali set” which holds several bowl selections such as rice, curry, pickles, vegetables and “dal bhat”''(a staple food in Nepal that is a thick lentil soup).''Meanwhile, for dessert, look for “sel roti” which is sweet and crispy on the outside, and soft and chewy on the inside.''.''Do some classes or workshops:''There are a number of shops in Thamel that can, for instance, teach you''how to cook Nepali cuisine'',\xa0do Buddhist''thangka''paintings, make woodcarvings, and more. You could even enroll in an amazing yoga class or retreat! Your activity choices are absolutely endless.''TIP'':''If you’re rather looking for authentic bazaar-esque places, head on over to either Asan, Indrachok or Mangal bazaars.''.''#3''– Fly above the Himalayas and Mt. Everest''Mt Everest''from Shutterstock.com''Let’s face it: a lot of us are NOT prepared to scale the summit of the world’s highest peak; so thankfully, as part of your things to do in Kathmandu, there are providers in Nepal that gives anyone the chance to get a bit close to the Himalayas and see the beauty that is Mt. Everest.''Of course, nothing beats the experience of trekking up to the summit or to the''Everest Base Camp''—''BUT,''if you can’t do that, then why not just fly there, right?

There are a lot of tour operators who offer helicopter rides, but when it comes to aerial rides, there are 3 airlines who are well-known for doing it: Buddha Air, Guna Air and Yeti Air.''.''Wanna book an Everest flight?''For a hassle-free experience, you can book your Everest mountain flight''here''. Subject to schedule availability, this flight tour will be made through Buddha Air, Yeti Air or Simrik Air.''.''TIP'':''Book a flight during the earliest part of the day for the leat chance of getting cloudy or bad weather.''NOTE'': If in case you don’t have the budget to fly nor the capacity to hike/trek, there is another option for you to see Mt. Everest “up close”. Aside from the obvious fact that you just go to places or towns that have a clear view of the Himalayas, you can also get an ‘aerial glimpse’ from up high on the plane when you get in or get out of Nepal — provided that you pick the right seat.''For example, if you’re flying to Nepal from Southeast Asia,\xa0reserve a window seat on the right (those labeled letter K, for example). And when flying back to Southeast Asia from Nepal, go for the left seats (letter A’s). You can always ask for tips from the airline you’re flying with to be sure!''.''As an important hub in Asia, Hong Kong is lauded by travelers worldwide for being a diverse and vibrant city — so it comes as no surprise that it has become a sought-after destination in the continent for years!

Be advised that New Zealand is firm about this given how they have sniffer dogs and bio-sensitive X-ray machines to detect any\xa0unwanted items.''.''When is the best time to visit New Zealand?''Technically, there is NEVER a bad time to go to New Zealand; yet of course, since both the North and South Islands are long and narrow, weather can vary a lot. But as an overview, below are New Zealand’s seasons:''Summer'': (December to February) This is the most popular time; hence, the busiest\xa0— but the beaches are great during this time of the year. Take note by the way that January will be the warmest month. Thinking about this, New Zealand is a great escape for these months of the year if you want to get away from harsh winters.''Autumn'': (March to May) This time is gorgeous as the leaves change colors and it’s also one of the best times to plan a getaway or a hiking spree since the summer crowds are mostly gone. To add, rates are on an ‘off peak’ level.''Winter'': (June to August) Queenstown for instance will be your winter wonderland, but there surely are a number of ski areas around the country. If you come in June you can enjoy the Queenstown Winter Festival.''Spring'': (September to November) This is one of the ‘off peak’ seasons as you get to enjoy warmer days and longer daylight hours.''I have gone through several''luxury travel experiences''from all over the world in the past 4 years, and my time with India’s famous''Maharajas''Express''train has been the most recent adventure that left me at a loss for words because I was just so inexplicably awestruck.''Of course this was my first ever''rail journey'', so I have nothing to compare it with — however, even with that fact, it was pretty clear to see that the train trip I did with them was an epitome of India’s lavish lifestyle that’s wholly\xa0reminiscent of how royalty or ‘''maharajas’''were treated!''TRIVIA:''The word “''Maharaja''” is Sanskrit for ‘great ruler’ or ‘high king’ and it was the title that was used to refer to those who ruled states or empires in India in the past.''Nowadays, the maharajas have lost their official powers ever since India gained independence in 1947; nevertheless, their wealth remained and most of them have turned into powerful businessmen instead, with some royal families or clans turning their palaces into hotels, museums, etc.''That being said, my days with the''Maharajas''Express''surely made me feel like a queen for days and I must say… it was quite a curious thing! I mean, like I said, I have already been to a handful of places where I was pampered silly, but it was here in India’s Maharajas Express that red carpets were rolled out for me in every stop while locals look on from the train platforms, waving and taking photos as if I was someone worth taking a photo of. You bet that at times, I couldn’t stop thinking: “''Why are they doing that? Why is this happening? Whaaaaat have I done to deserve this?”''(*whispers* Thank you, travel blogging. *whispers*).''Now of course, it’s no news that India is a melting pot of captivating beauty and organized chaos, with travelers choosing to experience either the country’s grit or lux — or a mixture of both. I already had the chance to see India’s gritty side when I did my 1st visit, so this train journey with the Maharajas Express was a welcomed change of pace that offered more comfort and ease. Besides, I can assure you that though the whole journey was filled with grandeur, I still got a taste of India’s enthralling and\xa0rugged sensory overload!''If all of what I’m saying still doesn’t convince you enough, then continue reading on below to see the top 10 reasons why you absolutely should consider traveling in India by riding their most luxurious train — the Maharajas Express!''.''Where to Stay in Delhi?''Come and check out my list of the ‘''Best Hotels in Delhi''‘ which features the top recommended choices for cheap to luxurious accommodation choices.''.''Top 10 Reasons to Travel with India’s Maharajas Express''#1''– ‘World’s Leading Luxury Train’''It’s no joke when the''World Travel Awards''grants the accolade to a train company as being the ‘World’s Leading Luxury Train’,''and for 6 consecutive years at that!''Supervised by the\xa0Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), the Maharajas Express actually launched just last 2010; and come 2012, they have gained this prestigious recognition from the World Travel Awards along with some other distinguished merits in the following years from Conde Nast Traveler, CNBC, Seven Stars, and more — and I bet that the rewards won’t be stopping anytime soon.''So yes, you’ll have a grand and elegant time with the Maharajas Express as the world’s costliest train and Asia’s most luxurious rail journey!

Fortunately, Maharajas Express has a tasteful selection of over 7 train journeys that are packed with insider experiences and done across India’s famous destinations (of which some are normally difficult to reach if not by train, and even more so when you’re pressed on time.)''Indian Panorama:''8 days / October to April''Route =''Delhi – Jaipur – Ranthambore – Fatehpur Sikri – Agra – Gwalior – Khajuraho – Varanasi – Lucknow – Delhi''.''Indian Splendor:''8 days / October to April''Route =''Delhi – Agra – Ranthambore – Jaipur – Bikaner – Jodhpur – Udaipur – Balasinor – Mumbai''.''Heritage of India:''8 days / October to April''Route =''Mumbai – Ajanta – Udaipur – Jodhpur – Bikaner – Jaipur – Ranthambore – Agra – Delhi''.''Treasures of India:''4\xa0days / October to April''Route =''Delhi – Agra – Ranthambore – Jaipur – Delhi''.''Gems of India:''4\xa0days / October to April''Route =''Delhi – Agra – Ranthambore – Jaipur – Delhi''.''Southern Sojourn:''8 days / Early September''Route =''Mumbai – Ratnagiri – Goa – Hampi – Mysore – Ernakulam – Kumarakom – Trivandrum''.''Southern Jewels:''8 days / Early September''Route =''Trivandrum – Chettinad – Mahabalipuram – Mysore – Hampi – Goa – Ratnagiri – Mumbai''.''I had the\xa0amazing opportunity of going on the “Indian Panorama” circuit which primarily lead us to the country’s famed''‘Golden Triangle’''that passes through Delhi, Agra and Jaipur. Now, looking at all these 7 journeys, I find it quite ideal how they all start and/or end in Delhi or Mumbai because given that these are 2 big cities, it makes for a prime location when it comes to arrivals, departures, connections, and transits!''.''#3''– Wide variety of excursion options''Varanasi''from Shutterstock.com''Depending on the train circuit that you choose, it is a guarantee that you will have an exciting blend of experiences all throughout your trip!''Truth be told, as a part of the base price that you pay, each destination stop would typically involve one to three excursions that will immerse you in the top activities, attractions, and highlights possible. Not to mention, you’ll be accompanied by an expert guide that will both entertain and educate you of India’s splendour.''(Rest assured, they will also give enough free time for everyone to wander off on their own!).''Though if in case you still want to spice up your days with even more activities — or if you rather want to focus on a certain ‘thing to do’, Maharajas Express offers optional special excursions as well at an added cost. These can range from\xa0traditional spa treatments, golf visits, art workshops, guided shopping sprees, cultural shows, etc.''Sure enough, the possibilities are endless for you!''NOTE:''All entrance fees to any sites are included in your base train journey price.''.''#4''– 5-star living and amenities on wheels''The best description that I can give for the whole of the Maharajas Express train is that is basically a royal palace on wheels that gives every guest an insider look into the past lavishness of Indian royalty!''As a newly-built train with modern fittings, Maharajas Express has a total of 23 huge and spacious carriages that combines accommodation cabins, 2 bars (with couches and game areas), 2 restaurants, generator rooms, and storage areas (for autos/cars, etc.). In fact, the whole train is a kilometer long and quite spacious too!''Moreover, with its wide windows, it always granted unobstructed panoramic views of the surrounding terrain. (If I say so myself, there were so many times that I couldn’t stop clicking away as the train drifts off from one city to the next.)''.''#5''– Four spacious and luxurious cabin choices''Refinement of the olden times is exuded across all the 4 cabin classes (totaling to 43 rooms) that the Maharajas Express train has, giving each guest the chance to enjoy all of what would normally come along with a stay at a 5-star hotel. Therefore yes, each room has a bathroom with water heating, complimentary toiletries, towels, hairdryer, bathrobe + slippers, LCD TV with satellite connection, DVD player with FREE movies, centralized air conditioning, Wi-Fi, electronic safe, closet, telephone, and work desk.''NOTE:''I was surprised how the rooms didn’t feel too cramped at all! They really paid a lot of attention to detail in order to make everything seamless yet lavish. As for Wi-Fi, it can get patchy in the rooms especially when the train is transiting;''however'', it was amazing that the WiFi at the bar areas\xa0continuously\xa0remained strong even if we were moving!''Deluxe (20 cabins):''112 square foot''Junior Suite (18 cabins):''150\xa0 square foot''Suite (4 cabins):''220\xa0 square foot''Presidential Suite (1 cabin – taking up a whole carriage):''448\xa0 square foot''.''#6''– 24/7 royal treatment and service''If you’ve been a reader of my blog for quite a while now, you would know how I regard the Philippines as being the''best''in hospitality (no bias), and now that I’ve come to India, I find that they’re a strong contender for this! After all, every personnel or staff that I met at the Maharajas Express exuded warmth and kindness.''And oh, don’t get me started with my amazing private butler!''…YES, we each had our own private butler that answered to our every whim, 24/7.''My butler’s name was Singh''(3rd man from the left in the photo above)''and I’m not kidding when I say that from the moment I met him, he treated me like I was the most important person in that train. Now I’m no ‘diva’ and I rarely have any specific needs''(I got the''‘I’m a strong & independent woman’''vibe going on);''but… with how attentive Singh was, there were times that I felt bad at how I didn’t give him enough instructions or requests throughout my stay (haha jk). Anyhow, may it be wake-up calls, setting up of daily tea times in your room, or being up-to-date on the activities — you name it, your butler will take care of it, all in order to make you feel like a royalty that’s “at home”.''.''#7''– Grand welcome in every stop''You will bask in lavishness inside the Maharajas Express train, and once you step out of it, you’ll be basked in lavishness even more! It’s an indulgence, for sure.''For starters, my feet always stepped on a red carpet whenever I got off the train. Flower confetti was spread around, garlands (called as “''malas''“) were wrapped around my neck, lively music wafted through the air and sprightly dancers welcomed us with gifts and smiles. As a matter of fact, I received so many gifts in all of the destination stops that I kept joking on how I didn’t need to buy souvenirs anymore due to the number of trinkets and scarves that I was receiving!''(And I really didn’t, haha).''Meanwhile, when it was time to get back to the train, most of the staff and all the private butlers are lined up to welcome us back with fresh towels and water. Aaah… it was bliss!''.''#8''– Feast like kings and queens on board''Maharajas Express has 2 themed fine dining restaurants that offers varying cuisines for the guest’s fancy and can accommodate up to 42 guests each. It helps to note that all meals are included in the train price and you are even free to order drinks or wine pairings at no extra charge. I’m not much for drinks, but I’m a big eater; so, everyday was like a feast for me as I continuously indulged in delicious Indian''thali''and desserts! (Of course, there are different Western and other Asian cuisines available that the on board chef can whip up for you).''Mayur Mahal:''Translated as ‘Peacock Palace’, this restaurant is named after India’s national bird. It was cozy and has a mixture of 2-person and 4-person tables.''.''Rang Mahal:''This ‘Palace of Colors’ is predominantly in green and gold hues,\xa0and I personally loved its lush interiors and hand-painted ceiling.''In line with the''maharajas''treatment, you will find that the plates all have real gold edges and the glasses are even made by Swarovski\xa0with exclusive hand-cut stones… it was insane!''.''#9''–\xa0Royal palace dinings''Most meals are take on board the train but as dependent on your train journey’s destinations, there will be times wherein you will be dining outside — and when you do, you will either be eating in the famous Taj group of hotels or in past royal palaces.''For instance, during my ‘Indian Parnoama’ circuit, we had a champagne breakfast in an outdoor garden of a luxury hotel that was overlooking the majestic Taj Mahal in Agra! There was even a night in which we had a barbecue buffet dinner in the courtyard of Jaivilas Palace in Gwalior, and another night wherein we had\xa0Awadhi lunch along with live Kathak Dance performance.''To say that every meal was a feast for the senses is truly an understatement!''.''#10''– FREE-flowing gifts and drinks''Previously, I have mentioned how we received gifts in every city stop that we did with the Maharajas Express, and as if that wasn’t enough already, in the end of our train journey, we were all surprised with a FREE gift of traditional Indian clothing such as''sari''(drape-like dress)\xa0for women and''kurta''(knee-long jacket) +''churidars''(pajama-like pants). I have always wanted to own a sari for myself so this was a really great surprise!''The fun doesn’t stop there because in the Maharajas Express train, everyone can drink''anything''at NO extra cost. So that can be bottled water, juices, teas, coffees, mocktails, and house brand alcoholic beverages (wines, spirits, beer, etc.). There are only a select few brands of alcoholic beverages that you’ll have to pay for — but basically, you’re free to drown yourself with all the kinds of drinks that you want everyday! Ain’t that a treat? Most of the luxury experiences I’ve done such as cruises usually don’t included drinks in their base price so this was a great addition on the inclusions.''.''Pre-Travel Guide''Are there other luxury trains in India?''Yes, to date there are 5 in total (including''Maharajas''Express''). The other 4 are:''Palace on Wheels''Deccan Odyssey''The Golden Chariot''Royal Rajasthan''It helps to note though that Maharajas Express is the newest of them all, yet the one with the most local and international awards.

To set everyone abuzz even further, they said that this will be the location wherein we would be allowed to do a polar plunge.''“''This is it, I’m going to do a polar plunge!”''I thought to myself excitedly.''After all, it’s not everyday that someone can have the unique opportunity of swimming in Antarctica waters — and even inside a volcano at that!''.''»''Stage #2: Doubt & Fear''«''“Meh, I’m not going to do it.”''Jonas quipped from across the room while I was preparing my clothes for the shore landing in Deception Island.''“Wait, what? You won’t do the polar plunge?”''Jonas shrugged,''“It’s not my thing, and I have to work.”''Well, there goes my ‘plunging’ support buddy! Aww… \xa0Then again, nope, I was not to be swayed. Of course I was a bit disappointed, but I didn’t let it bother me too much.''– – –''Later at lunch, I passed by one of the service staff and he gave me a little nudge, “''So, are you going to do the polar plunge today?”''“''Yes,”''I replied, “''How about you? Have you done it before?”''He chuckled, “''Yes, and I will NEVER do it again!”''Something in me faltered, but I shrugged it off. I went back to my cabin and in order to hype myself up for the experience, I\xa0typed the phrase “''polar plunge''” on my web browser. I simply wanted to browse through some cool photos — but one thing led to another… and I rather stumbled into article headlines that read:''Polar Plunges: Are They Even Good for You?''Is the Polar Plunge Safe?''Swimmer Rescued During Polar Plunge''How to Survive a Polar Plunge''Wait.''I can die from this? What do they mean it’s not safe? Someone had to be rescued before? And what — I have to “survive” it?''It then dawned on me that my initial “euphoria” on the idea of doing my first ever polar plunge had clouded my practical judgment that: OF. COURSE. Swimming in cold waters has risks that are not limited to shock, heart attack or hypothermia (maybe even drowning because I’m not a good swimmer myself lol).\xa0It didn’t even help that I started to recall how cold I felt when I first took a dip in European waters — and mind you, that was in the''summer!''So okaaaay.''Maybe this wasn’t a good idea after all…''.''»''Stage #3: Facing it All''«''Sure, I might die because of “cold shock” if I’m not healthy enough or if I happen to have a heart problem — but that’s just highly unlikely. The expedition team even told me that they never had someone who died from doing a polar plunge; besides, the whole plunge will only be for a few minutes (even seconds if anyone couldn’t bear it) and there will also be a doctor on shore.''Naturally, the above factors were all sensible reasons for lessening my building doubts and fears; but do you know what took it all away completely…?''When I thought of ‘regrets’''.''If you’re a regular reader of my blog and if you’ve followed my''whole journey''up to now, you would know how I dislike having regrets in my life. I didn’t want to have a lot of “what ifs” in the future — and certainly, I didn’t want this polar plunge to be one of those.''So that afternoon, I boarded the zodiac boat that was sailing to Deception Island’s Pendulum Cove. As I sat there, I can already see the cluster of ship guests on shore, both old and young, who were either stripping off their clothes or running straight into the freezing waters. I couldn’t help but giggle…''“Yup, I am one of those crazy lunatics.”''After I set foot on the cove, Hurtigruten’s expedition team leader gave us a tip that we could walk (or even run) around the island before taking the dip so that our bodies can get to warm up a bit more before the plunge itself. However, I was in a daze — I went straight to the part of the shore where all the swimmers were.''I just wanted to get it over with before I could change my mind.''Once there, I did a quick chat with one of the swimmers who gave me an encouraging mini speech and then, without missing a beat, I set up my camera and started putting off one layer of clothing at a time. Now I assure you that I shuddered terribly when\xa0the harsh Antarctic winds first hit contact with my bare skin — plus, I felt even more chills when my bare feet touched the cold black sand. It didn’t even help that the water boots they made me wear was sogging wet!''I ran over to one of the expedition staff and muttered,''“I’m ready.”''She put a check mark beside my name and afterwards, I swiftly turned and ran towards the water.''.''»''Stage #5: Adrenaline High''«''You see, running is essential in order for this particular polar plunge to be successful. Some other ships do it ‘pirate style’ where you get to jump off a plank; but for ships like Hurtigruten, it is up to you to set your pace — and nope, there’s no room for slow wading and adjusting here: you MUST run, or else, you might back out given that the water is so''awfully''cold.''So as my body gradually went through the water, all the obscene words that I’ve learned in this life spilled out from my lips.''And when the water hit my waist — there was a pause. I didn’t think that a sudden ‘slow mo’ could happen to me in real life, but it did. And for\xa0some reason the word “''PLUNGE''” popped in my head. Before I knew it, my body automatically did a little dive and then I was wholly under the water.''…Aaah, I can still recall how cold \xa0and painful it was as if millions of tiny needles were piercing through my skin! But before I could process everything further, again: there was another pause and I think this is the part when my body was already done with the cold shock response. I proceeded to push myself out of the water and then walked back to shore. One of the expedition staff wrapped a towel around me while saying,''“Good job!”''and as I was drying myself off,''I felt incredibly weird''.''For some reason, my body didn’t feel like it was cold anymore. Rather, I felt so''refreshed''and''energized''.''At some point, I even took off my towel and then took some photos of myself on the beach with just my bikini on. But of course… I didn’t take too long because I know that my body must actually be very cold despite the numb yet invigorating feeling that I was having!''Soon after, I was back on the ship and enjoying a hot jacuzzi (as if to remind my body how it felt to be warm again).''TRIVIA'':''There was a time when you can dig holes in the warm sands of Pendulum Cove so you can enjoy a ‘hot spring’ by the bay — but this is NO longer allowed under the Antarctic Treaty. Hence, people’s perception that there are hot springs in Deception Island is not true; and believe me, even if it was still allowed to do that, there is no way that your plunge won’t be cold.''You can also do a polar plunge in Whalers Bay of Deception Island, but the upside of doing it in Pendulum Cove is that once you get back on the beach after your swim, you’ll get to enjoy brief moments of semi-warm sand on your feet.''Antarctica''is known for being the land of extremes (it is the coldest and windiest place on Earth after all!). Given this fact, most of its guests are often seeking for thrill and the “''extreme''” — and yes… I happen to be one of those people. Therefore, in the spirit of my epic''20-day expedition'', I did a''polar plunge''inside an active volcano during one of the first few days that I landed on the peninsula. (Yes, you read that correctly:''inside''a volcano). A few days later, I thought:''“Why not put it a step further and do camping in Antarctica’s sub-zero conditions too?”''And well — I did just that! I slept under the amazing Antarctic sky with only the thin wall of a tent separating me from the elements, and it was such a memorable once-in-a-lifetime experience.''Now, a lot of''IAATO''(International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators)\xa0companies such as the provider I went with (called as''Hurtigruten'') provides camping as one of the optional''things to do in Antarctica''. As early as now, I highly recommend that you to take this wonderful opportunity when you’re going on an expedition cruise to the ‘White Continent’ because it’s not everyday that you can say that you’ve slept on the actual grounds of the bottom of the world (not to mention, acquiring a slot in this camping activity is often limited too).''So to give you an idea (as well as some more info) about this surreal activity, do continue reading below to read about my experience!''.''Camping in Antarctica''»''Is it safe?''«''Is it safe for us?''Absolutely. You do NOT even have to be an experienced camper because just about anyone can do camping in Antarctica. Also, remember this: you’re in the hands of experts who are particularly knowledgeable about the Antarctic terrain, so as long as you follow their instructions, you’ll be fine! Besides, the expedition team who will be with you for the rest of the night will always be in constant communication with the ship (which is located not too far away from where you will be). So if conditions get worse, the activity will either be cancelled or everyone will be whisked away back to the ship via zodiac boats.''Is it safe for the Antarctic environment?''First things first, IAATO-approved tour operators will always ensure that camping in Antarctica is held in a place that will NOT disturb any of the wildlife — but it is possible that the surrounding penguins will come and disturb you with their ‘calls’''*wink*''. Secondly, as I will be discussing in the third section below, there will be strict regulations that will be implemented in order to preserve the pristine beauty of the continent. So after the overall activity, nothing will be left behind, may it be camping\xa0gear, food, human waste, etc.''.''»''What are the rules?''«''Camping in Antarctica comes with some rules that every participating person should follow:''NO one must bring any kind of food to the Antarctic soil. (Excluding an approved snack bar that will be given to you by the ship. However, this is only to be consumed when someone gets really hungry during the night — which is actually very unlikely because you will be setting off to your camping spot after dinner.)''While we’re discussing food, NO campfires will be done. So nope, you can’t warm up by the fire, roast some marshmallows and drink a hot cup of chocolate — that’s an experience you’ll have to enjoy somewhere else.''Drinks are also NOT allowed except for the bottle of water provided.''Naturally, NO throwing of any waste on Antarctica.''Speaking of waste, that includes human waste too. For my case, my ship with Hurtigruten typically brings disposable toilets that will only be used for when it’s really needed (after the camping in Antarctica, these will be brought back to the ship for discarding).''No brushing of teeth is allowed either. You can do this before you leave for the camping or once you’re back on the ship on the next day (since departure is at early in the morning).''Do NOT walk away from the camp.''All IAATO rules regarding wildlife are to be followed at all times, meaning that you must keep at least 5-meter distance from penguins — no touching and no stressing them.''Try to maintain silence. No shouting or making unnecessary noises.''In short: you only need to bring your clothes, camera gear, and the provided camping paraphernalia. (Of course, if at any point you start to feel uneasy and would want to go back to the ship, the crew will surely arrange your return by zodiac or polarcirkel boat.)''.''»''What to bring and wear?''«''Temperature in the continent starts to drop when the night creeps in; but rest assured, since it is summer season, it will be quite bearable. (During my camping in Antarctica, the night reached only about\xa0-5° celsius).''What do I bring for the camping?''The ship will be providing each pair of guests the following high-quality gear that are up to Antarctic standards:''a strong 3-person''tent, 2 breathable\xa0bivouac or bivy bags (rated for extreme sub-zero cold temperatures), a big\xa0foam pad (for added warmth) and 2 inflatable sleeping pads or mattresses.''What else then do I need to bring? What do I wear?''Weather can be unpredictable but what’s for sure is that the temperature will drop and that the winds will start to get very strong into the night so you need to warm yourself up. Below are the recommended clothing and accessories you need to bring when camping in Antarctica:''Thermal underwear''Warm sweater''Down outer jacket or parka (usually provided by the ship for free)''Trousers''Warm headgear (bonet, hat, etc.)''Warm gloves or mittens (and an additional spare gloves)''Neck gaiter''Thick socks (and an additional spare socks)''Sunglasses''Sunblock''Medication (in case you need any)''Waterproof muck boots\xa0(usually provided by the ship for free)''Flashlight (or your phone is enough; this is helpful especially around March when the sun briefly sets.

Not only do they demonstrate a high-level of commitment and expertise for following safety protocols, but they also have a great record for being the best and common choice for any Antarctica visit. As for the different ways of reaching the ‘White Continent’, below are some of your options…''By cruise ship.''This is the MOST common way to visit the Antarctic and the cruise can start and end from any of these locations:\xa0Ushuaia in Argentina, Punta Arenas in Chile, Bluff in New Zealand or Hobart in Australia.''Depending on the provider, the length of the trip, and the kind of cruise expedition that you pick, you can also do additional activities or excursions in the Antarctic as well as visit other Antarctic and sub-Atlantic islands along the way.\xa0It helps to note though that the size of the ship matters: in general, smaller ships are preferred because they can go to more places and do more landings. …''Why more landings, you might ask?''Well, according to IAATO guidelines, there can only be 100 people at a time on land — so, if your boat has more than 200 people, you might just spend only a few hours on the shore.''With this, I highly advise that you go for''Hurtigruten’s MS Fram ship'', which is a small yet strong vessel that carries about 200 guests. This was the ship that I went with when I visited Antarctica and every day, we did at least 2 landings to different locations (which was also packed with optional excursions like\xa0kayaking, camping, zodiac excursions, hikes, and others).''NOTE: Most of the Antarctic ships are NOT icebreakers since if they are, you will have a rough time crossing the seas like the Drake Passage (either way, the ships are ice-strengthened which are equally tough).''By plane.''There are 3 ways to do this: you can do a [1] ‘fly over’, a [2] direct flight, or a [3] fly-cruise option. First, as the name implies, a ‘fly over’ will just be a sightseeing flight wherein you will be''above''the continent for hours as you admire the views. This kind of flight\xa0only takes off from Australia and it will cost from $1,000 to $8,000.\xa0Second, direct commercial flights can be done from Argentina, Australia, Chile or South Africa — but they can be quite rare. (A quick Google search will lead you to some providers who schedule flight trips to the continent.) Lastly,\xa0the fly-cruise option will just cut your time on a cruise ship (to avoid the rough Drake Passage, for instance). These flights will take you to places like King George Island where you will then board your designated ship. Most of the time, prices for this start at $10,000 and departs from Chile.''By yacht.''There are about a dozen of these charter yachts that offer 3 to 6 week trips to the Antarctic Peninsula from South America. Even if it can provide more freedom and flexibility, you must remember that it is pricier (starting at $1,000+ per day), more treacherous (the seas will rock you harder) and can require work (since most yachts would want you to help out.)''◘◘''Is it dangerous to go to Antarctica?''Not at all. Sure, Antarctica is an extreme environment with unpredictable weather so accidents can happen; however, this is exactly why it is highly advisable that you opt for IAATO tour operators (like''Hurtigruten'') since they have shown great experience and familiarity to operating in these kinds of conditions.''Either way, much like how you behave in any vacation that you do abroad, simply stay cautious at all times and you’ll be fine.''Always''follow the instructions of the expedition team and be vigilant. Rest assured, all ships have a doctor on board for any immediate emergency but in cases where medical evacuation is required, just ensure that you purchase a''travel insurance''beforehand.''◘◘''When can I visit?''Antarctica is inaccessible to tourists for the majority of the year due to its extreme conditions — it IS called as the world’s coldest and windiest place after all. In fact, winter temperatures can fall up to\xa0-70°C \xa0(…it even reached -94.7°C back in 2010 and -89.2 in 1983) and that comes together with 24 hours of darkness too!''Nevertheless, things get better during the summer season between''November and March''when the ice starts to break and the temperature gets warmer; hence, cruise expeditions are run during this time of the year and most landings are done at the tip of the continent along its west coast. It helps to note that temperatures there average at only about 0°C to 8°C (with close to 24 hours of sunlight).''NOVEMBER'':\xa0This is said to be the time when you will see Antarctica in its most ‘untouched’ form. Icebergs are at their biggest, snow is pristine, and the penguins start to mate (with them laying eggs at the end of the month in their nests). However, the temperatures are still quite''cold''and polar ice is still breaking up so the downside of traveling to Antarctica in this month is that you might not be able to access some areas. Moreover, wildlife such as whales and penguins are more difficult to spot.''.''DECEMBER to EARLY FEBRUARY'':\xa0December is said to be the BEST month for traveling to Antarctica. As the continent starts to warm up, it creates the perfect conditions for seals, penguins and whales — therefore, wildlife is a lot easier to find (including the cute little seal pups and penguin chicks who have just been born). Whales, in particular, are best seen in February. Also, since these are some of the months wherein there is more hours of sunlight, you’ll have plenty of opportunities in the day to take wonderful photos.''.''MID-FEBRUARY to MARCH'':\xa0There are several pros and cons for visiting during this time of the summer season. Let’s start with the cons: temperatures start to get a bit colder, most wildlife would have already went out to sea, and landings will tend to be rockier and muddier. But for the ‘pros’: whales are still abundant for spotting, the penguin chicks are larger and starting to ‘molt’ (or shed their fur), and there are lesser vessels (so there’s less competition for landings).''For my case, I landed in Antarctica sometime in early to mid-December with Hurtigruten’s''20-day ‘Ultimate Antarctica Experience’''and I’ve seen a lot of different penguins, whales (orca + finback + humpback ones), seals, glaciers and massive icebergs. There were no problem with landings nor was there any competition — we were the only ship around during the days of our visit. Weather was also perfect averaging at about 2°C to 5°C, so I didn’t wear too much layers; at one point, I even sweated a lot when we were hiking up a hill! The winds were still pretty strong though and there were times that it was cloudy; but for the most part, we had great sunny weather.''All in all, it’s best to remember that every trip to Antarctica is unique. No matter if your friend went on a different trip in the same month and same cruise as you do, the experiences you’ll both have will most likely be dissimilar because every voyage will depend on ice and weather conditions. This means that there can be days where you will experience and see amazing things that some others might not (if you’re lucky!). For example: our ship sighted about 50 humpback whales while we were on our way to the Antarctic Peninsula and they say that this occurrence was quite rare in December!''◘◘''Do I need a visa to go to Antarctica?''Since there is NO single country or\xa0government who owns nor controls Antarctica, visitors technically do NOT need visas.\xa0However, with the existence of the Antarctic Treaty’s Protocol on Environmental Protection, it requires visitors (who are citizens of countries that are signatories of this treaty: including USA, Canada, EU, and Australia) to acquire a permit prior to visiting Antarctica. These permits are almost always acquired through tour operators.''EXAMPLE'': If you booked via a cruise ship, permits are covered by the cruise company that you’re going with.\xa0If visiting by air, you must check with your local government or airline if you have the right paperwork. If in doubt, you could always ask your Antarctica tour operator.''Meanwhile, like I’ve already discussed, most ships and vessels depart from ports in places like Argentina, Chile, Falkland Islands, New Zealand, and South Africa. Depending on your nationality, you might need a visa to be able to set foot on the ports of any of these said countries in order to start your voyage to Antarctica.''So for my case, since I’m a Philippine passport holder and my cruise started in Ushuaia, Argentina, I needed to apply for an''Argentina Visa''. As such, it is your responsibility to check if you need visas to any of the aforementioned starting ports.''.''.''About a Cruise Trip''◘◘''How much is a cruise trip to Antarctica?''Antarctica is obviously NOT a budget destination given how most cruise expeditions start at a price of $5,000 per person. However, there’s the possibility of paying only $4,000 if you manage to get a last minute deal in Ushuaia (the main starting point of cruise ships in Argentina) during November or December. This option is only ideal if you have the time and patience to wait for a chance to come by — which they say can be quite rare. Yet again, it’s worth a shot!''For a more hassle-free experience, naturally, it’s better to book in advance.''Hurtigruten''‘s expeditions usually start at $5,000 \xa0per person.\xa0But if I may add a tip: if you email Hurtigruten via''[email\xa0protected]''and mention my promo code ‘IAMAILEEN’, you will get a special discounted price quote!''◘◘''What currencies should I bring?''Antarctica is not a country, so it does NOT have its own currency. However, there will be some places in the Antarctic Peninsula such as Port Lockroy (where you can find the Penguin Post Office museum and souvenir shop) and some research station facilities that will sell some stuff to visitors. With them, currencies like the USA dollars, Pound Sterling and Euro are generally accepted (together with MasterCard and Visa cards).''As dependent on your ship too, they can accept other currencies''(e.g. Hurtigruten is a Norwegian company so they accept the Norwegian krone currency on board.)''◘◘''What should I pack or wear for the trip?''There is a LOT to take note of — from seasickness medicines to the proper clothing. So if you want to learn more or if you want to see a complete packing list, read my''Antarctica Cruise Packing List''.''◘◘''Should I get travel insurance? And how about immunizations?''It is a MUST to get travel insurance for your Antarctica trip (most ships require it too after all). When purchasing one, I would highly recommend''World Nomads''since aside from being a highly-rated insurance provider, they also have more than enough coverage for overseas medical help, evacuation, emergencies, flight problems and more.''Meanwhile, when it comes to immunizations, there is NO such requirement when entering Antarctica. However, if you are staying in Chile or Argentina (which often are points of embarkation for cruise trips), you should check the health recommendations or requirements for these respective areas as per your nationality.''◘◘''What can I expect on the cruise?''A LOT! Besides, Antarctica is known for being a magical place in this world that will absolutely give anyone an unforgettable experience — from enjoying breathtaking landscapes to witnessing unique''Antarctic wildlife''up close… the possibilities are simply endless in every shore landing!''Of course, everything still relies on weather and ice conditions but there are always so many activities you can enjoy such as overnight camping, hiking, snowshoeing, kayaking, and more. For a complete list of''things to do in Antarctica'', see''here''.''◘◘''How fit do I have to be?''In general, you must be of good health and are able to walk reasonable distances or even on uneven terrain — however, this does NOT mean that you have to be extremely fit like professional athletes or hkikes because there are options for everyone in every shore landing (such as walking only a short distance or doing a different activity from the rest.) Anyhow, if you have problems or physical limitations, just notify the tour operator in advance and they will make ways for you. That being said, there are ways for everyone to participate in this trip of a lifetime!''◘◘''Will I get seasick?''This totally depends on the sea conditions and on the person itself: some people surprisingly have no problems while some only experience seasickness for only a day or two. Personally, I did get sick on our first day at sea but with the help of''Sea Bands,''I didn’t feel seasick anymore for the rest of the trip.''(If you happen to still be dizzy, doctors on the Hurtigruten ship also handed out these transdermal ear patches for further preventing nausea).''All in all, if you’re someone who gets easily seasick, it’s a good idea to check with a doctor beforehand or to pack Sea Bands and seasickness pills; otherwise, there will always be an on board doctor to assist you.\xa0But to give you some peace of mind, you will NOT be sailing all the time. Cruise tour operators always space the days so you’ll have time to catch a breather.''NOTE:''Some people are incredibly concerned about the infamous Drake Passage which most Antarctica cruise ships will have to go through. If you don’t know it yet, Drake Passage is said to be world’s roughest seas given that it is where the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern seas converge. There aren’t any nearby landmass either so the currents here meet with NO resistance, resulting to it being the choppiest waters in the world.''However, one’s experience here can either be called ‘Drake Lake’ or ‘Drake Shake’ and our ship’s crossing was somewhere in the middle. It was swaying more than usual, but it was manageable. Therefore, everything will depend on weather conditions as well as the speed of the ship (bigger ships can make the crossing in just 24 hours while smaller ones can take 36 to 48 hours).''◘◘''Is it hard to sleep on the ship?''From my experience, not at all. There is the issue of how sunshine exists for almost 24-hours in a day during the Antarctic summer, however, all cabins have thick blinds so it should not disrupt your body clock. Alternatively, you can pack along some eye masks to shield away the light.''◘◘''Is there internet and entertainment on board?''Some ships have it, some don’t. With''Hurtigruten'', they have a reliable WiFi connection on board at an extra cost. They also have an internet café with available computers on select ships that they have. (Cost usually starts at for one day).''As for entertainment,\xa0unlike typical cruise ships that have ostentatious entertainment facilities, the ships that sail to Antarctica have minimal entertainment on board; rest assured, there is enough to keep anyone busy including social events, workshops, and lectures from experienced staff who are typically made up of scientists. After all, this kind of adventure is more about relaxation and discovery!''◘◘''Can children come?''Most Antarctica tour providers have a minimum age requirement that ranges from 6 to 12 years old, while others leave it up to the parents to decide whether the cruise will be appropriate for their children. That being said, it’s best to check with your tour operator for any restrictions that they may have. Most of the time though, given the limited access to medical facilities, children with chronic conditions such as asthma, etc. are not advised to go on an Antarctica cruise.''Just take note that long trips on sea can be tiring for children. Of course, there are a lot of fascinating wildlife and scenes to keep them occupied but it’s always a good idea to bring plenty of entertainment options for your kids.''◘◘''Is it a trip that can be done by solo travelers?''Absolutely!\xa0Some ships have single occupancy rooms or have shared room cabins; and of course, you’ll never really be alone during the trip because there are so many opportunities for mingling with others. (Or of course, if you want more solitude, you’re free to maintain that too!).''Wanna go to Antarctica? Email''[email\xa0protected]''w/ code''IAMAILEEN''to get a discounted quote!''iAmAileen''.''.''When in Antarctica''Emperor Penguins''from Shutterstock.com''◘◘''Will we have a chance to learn more about Antarctica?''All IAATO operators are encouraged to provide ways of enriching and educating their guests about the environment of Antarctica and its protection — so yes, there will be educational programs or lectures available that will be conducted by trained professionals.''With''Hurtigruten'',\xa0there were FREE movies and lectures every day in which everyone was free to participate or not. They let us learn more about the wildlife and the islands we were visiting, and they were even delivered by the expedition team that was made up of expert geologists, marine biologists, historians, and ornithologists among many others! If you happen to have any specific requests, you’re always free to approach any of the staff scientists on board or on shore.''◘◘''What penguin species will I see? Can I touch them?''Naturally, penguins are the first type of animals that people think of when Antarctica comes to mind, but don’t forget that there are other kinds of''wildlife''to see there such as whales and seals! Anyhow,\xa0to date, there are 17 species of penguins in the world''BUT''only 7 of them live on and around Antarctica:''Four (4) live and nest in and around the Antarctic continent: Adélie, Emperor, Chinstrap, and Gentoo''The first 2 are found way further in the icy continent and the rest prefer to be at the northern tip''Three (3) breed in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands: King, Macaroni and Rockhopper''For a complete list of Antarctic animals that you will see, read''here''.''As for touching them, it helps to note that there are strict wildlife guidelines that all visitors to Antarctica must abide by. For instance, we were advised to maintain a''5-meter distance''from any wildlife at all times (there are some species that require greater distance and your expedition team will tell you). Nevertheless, most of the penguins and seals were curious creatures so there were many instances wherein they were super close to us; which then makes for a great experience (other than it being a great opportunity for taking amazing photos and videos!).''So simply put: we didn’t approach them, we let them approach us.''◘◘''Are there any citizens of Antarctica?''Not really because no one truly owns Antarctica nor does anyone have actual sovereignty. There was one time though when''an Argentinian baby was born in Antarctica''as an effort of Argentina to leave a mark of sovereignty in the continent but that didn’t count.''Anyway, bottom line: there are no citizens of Antarctica. There are only two main groups of people there: they can either be tourists or researchers and none of them live there indefinitely.''◘◘''Will\xa0I see the Southern Lights and the Southern Cross?''The Aurora Australis or Southern Lights are only visible in Antarctica from March to September, however there’s a slim chance for tourists to see this because it’s not often visible in areas in which cruise ships are allowed to land — plus, there needs to be sufficient darkness for it to be seen. As for the Southern Cross, it’s visible at any time of the year; but then again, there needs to be enough darkness which is not the case during the height of the tourist season (which is summer).''◘◘''Can I fly my drone in Antarctica?''No. IAATO does''not''allow any recreational use of drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to protect the pristine scene and wildlife. But if you really need to use it, there are instances wherein it’s allowed — kindly just check with your operator since all requests are usually lodged via an application permit.''◘◘''Is there anything else I should take note of?''Always remember that Antarctica is a fragile environment, so in order to maintain its pristine conditions, please act your part in being environmentally responsible. Do NOT pollute, do NOT introduce any foreign organisms into Antarctica’s ecosystem, and do NOT harass any wildlife. Listen to your expedition leaders very well and follow their instructions — and of course, have fun!

Nevertheless, the good news is that the tip of the continent (which is called as the''Antarctic Peninsula'') as well as the surrounding sub-Antarctic islands are more hospitable; so, they become ideal spots for witnessing some of the amazing Antarctic animals!''TRIVIA'':\xa0Antarctic life forms are typically called as ‘extremophiles’ given that they can thrive in physically extreme habitats that would typically be detrimental to most life on Earth.''This term though is usually only used for microbes but penguins are sometimes referred to as such given that they can live in this place in which most other normal animals cannot.''With that said, if you are ever a part of an''Antarctica expedition'', below are some of the incredible Antarctic animals that you can see during your cruise through the surrounding islands and the Peninsula itself!''.''Wanna go to Antarctica?

After all, this island is often called as the paradise of wildlife-lovers given the huge number of''Antarctic animals''that lead their lives there with little to no concern for the occasional human visits.''Though, if I may be so bold to say… I wasn’t actually expecting something''unprecedented''from such sub-Antarctic islands because I thought that all the ‘fun’ will be found in the White Continent itself; so naturally, it was a welcomed feeling when I was blown away by the beauty of the remote South Georgia island!''Before you start confusing this with the country of Georgia or the USA state of Georgia, let me make clear that South Georgia is an island in the southern Atlantic Ocean. It was first found in 1675 and it is currently a part of the British Overseas Territory of\xa0South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. It is NOT part of the Antarctic continent but it does lie south of the Antarctic Convergence (curve encircling Antarctica) and regarded as a sub-Antarctic island.''When it comes to the population, there is no permanent inhabitants in South Georgia but there resides a British Government Officer, Deputy Postmaster, scientists, and support staff from the British Antarctic Survey —''not to mention, the\xa0‘local’ colonies of adorable penguins and seals!''Truth be told, this was my first time to get incredibly close to such wildlife (in a way wherein they were SO close to my feet!). It was really incredible.''And the icing to the cake? I even got to witness a colony that was made up of almost a''MILLION''of''king penguins''!''…Wanna know more about this adventure? Then continue reading below.''(If you’re curious on how you can visit this magical island, go to my''Pre-Travel Guide''at the bottom of this post).''Top photo of''Colony King Penguins''from Shutterstock.com''.''A few days ago, I stumbled across''Routeperfect'', and I just had to share it with you all! After all, it’s such a useful trip planning tool.''First off, I was looking at how best to plan a Europe trip from Athens to Paris for 21 days and with a limited budget:''where to go, what to do?, etc.''Usually, I spend hours and hours researching routes, transfers, recommendations, as well as cross- checking hotel sites and it takes me forever! (Plus, let’s face it, time is money!). But with this site, I had an outline of my trip in less than a few minutes, and even 10 minutes later I was already booking. I just couldn’t believe how easy it was!''.''RoutePerfect''»''What is Routeperfect?''Routeperfect''is a free travel planning tool that allows you to quickly generate a customized trip. YOU choose your start and end date, where you want to fly in and out of, what your budget is and what type of trip you’re looking for (solo, romantic, family or friends). And the coolest part: once the basics are done, you can choose all the things you like to do and get rid of all the things you don’t. Check out below what the trip planner generated for me:''If in case you can’t see it clearly from this screen shot, there are eight interests you can customize your trip on and these are: beaches, small towns, culture, food, nightlife, nature, active and historic places.''.''»''Putting Routeperfect to the test''I wanted to see if the route would change dramatically if I updated my preferences, and I was surprised at how much it did! Instead of beaches and nightlife I chose small towns and historic places, and the route totally changed from coastal cities to inland ones (and a couple that I have never heard of!) which I thought was pretty neat.''I think the best thing about the tool is that you can discover new places that you probably wouldn’t have even thought about. Clearly, the technology is able to update according to your preferences, and that the towns it suggests are even dependent on what the system believes you would enjoy the most!''Have a look at my new updated trip which now contains more nature and small towns, and less beaches:''I read that every single location was entered manually into their system and given a score for each individual preference, so that it knows what to suggest based on how you like to travel — that’s such a smart programming, right?''For each location,''Routeperfect''also includes information about each town and suggests a bunch of different attractions and things to do. But the cool thing is that although it has suggested to me some places I didn’t originally think of going to (because, as I said, I was interested in small towns and historic places), it still ensured that I spent the right amount of time in the larger cities, such as Paris, that needed more time to get around. In any event, you can delete a place if you don’t want to go there and manually change out your route.''Needless to say, if you suffer from FOMO, like I do, Routeperfect is great for you!''.''»''Sightseeing and activities''So not only does it help you to organise the overall trip, you can go deeper than this and even work out what you’re going to do each day! The site shows the main attractions to see in a place, according to your interests. Either way, all the info on the destinations it suggests for you is included in the site, so you can decide if you want to go there.''.''»''Booking the hotels''When it comes to planning your overall itinerary, Routeperfect also shortlists the hotels for you, so all of the logistics are sorted at once.''Each of the accommodations that were suggested were around the three star mark. This was great considering I set my budget to ‘Moderate.’ Apparently the site’s algorithm is so clever it works out exactly what type of trip you’re on (in my case solo) so it sorts through tens of thousands of accommodations from thousands of suppliers to shortlist the right ones for me. For example, if I was was travelling with a family, I guess it would find me availability for family rooms.''Moreover, the site shortlists approx 3 to 4 hotels for each location. I definitely like to scrutinize my accommodation, which is great, as the system is integrated with TripAdvisor so you can quickly see what the hotel is like. In this example the hotels picked by Routeperfect were clearly good quality as they all came up as, at least, four stars on TripAdvisor. And if you don’t want to stay in one of the hotels they’ve shortlisted for you, not a problem, you can just scroll for more options!''.''»''The price''They say that “''customers save up to 20% on their trip because Routeperfect allows access to hidden rates by bundling hotels together as a package.''”''For those of you who aren’t travel buffs, this basically means that they offer such a great discount given that the actual rate of each individual hotel is unknown. Hotels usually have a certain allocation of rooms they can sell at a much lower rate; however, they also don’t want to cheapen themselves by publicising these really low rates, and undercut some of the big well-known booking sites! With that in mind, Routeperfect has special accreditation to access these hidden rates, so when you see on their site that you can save up to 20% — trust me, it is for real!''Just to check though, (I’m ever the sceptic!) I tried to plan the exact same trip by myself with flights, hotel and a car to see if it really was cheaper… and well, I couldn’t believe that it was about 18% cheaper! Not only that, but it took me hours to plan, and remember, for all of us – time is money! So if you take this aspect into account you could say Routeperfect saves you even more money.''Want some more ways/ideas for saving money while traveling?

Scary right? BUT the thing is, Antarctica cruise expeditions''only''happen during the summer season between November and March when the ice starts to break. During this time, the temperature gets warmer and most landings which are done at the tip of the continent actually has temperatures that average at only about''0°C to 8°C''(with close to 24 hours of sunlight).''So simply put: it’s not extremely cold because Antarctic weather during cruise expedition season can be nice and cool in the day.

Truth be told, apart from the already mentioned fact that they are a top-rated company in the USA, I chose to experience and support Pink Jeep Tours because of their tried-and-tested expertise, their superb customer service, their dedication to environmental responsibility, as well as their commitment to passenger safety and tour guide expertise!''Besides, as an established brand in the Southwest scene, Pink Jeep Tours even offers a variety of historical and natural expeditions in the following locations that can certainly fit any kind of traveler out there.''»''Serviced Locations''Photo by\xa0Pink Jeep Tours''SEDONA.''This is the founding point of Pink Jeep Tours and it remains to be the company’s headquarters whilst they continue to bring guests to the area’s stunning red rock formations and Native American Culture on a pink Jeep Wrangler.''~ List of Sedona tours: [''click'']''GRAND CANYON.''Pink Jeep Tours in the Grand Canyon depart from Tusayan which is just south of the Grand Canyon National Park’s entrance.''~ List of Grand Canyon tours: [''click'']''LAS VEGAS.''This chapter was opened more than 15 years ago with excursions happening within Las Vegas''and''departing from Las Vegas.

Nowadays, they have 2 kinds:''Pink Adventure Tour Trekker'': Designed by Shawn Wendell, this is considered to be the cleanest-burning heavy-duty diesel engine in North America that tours the Grand Canyon, the Death Valley, the Valley of Fire, and the Hoover Dam. Luxurious yet rugged, it is an all-terrain vehicle that is equipped with 10 comfortable reclining leather captain seats, DVD player with 15-inch TV, emergency kits, road safety equipments, adjustable rear ride suspension (for improved ride quality), and large tinted windows for unparalleled viewing.''Pink Jeep Wrangler'':\xa0This is used across most of the excursions in Pink Jeep Tours and it offers great extra passenger room while providing smooth off-road and terrain cruising. And much like the Tour Trekker, this is custom-designed yet rebuilt in order to make it into a prime tour vehicle fit for Pink Jeep Tours’ goals.''.''Grand Canyon West Rim Adventure Tour''The Grand Canyon has 4 different parts:''South Rim:''(~5 hours from Las Vegas, opens year-round)''This part is commonly chosen by visitors for its abundance of beautiful views, visitor-friendly services, and family-oriented activities. With tours commonly\xa0starting from Tusayan, you will also find a lot of options for lodging, shops, and restaurants.''North Rim:''(~6 hours from Las Vegas, open from Mid-May to mid-October)''This part is said to receive only 1/10th of the number of visitors that the South Rim gets, and this might be due to the smaller visitation area that is present in its expanse — to illustrate, if the South Rim has dozens of major viewpoints, the North Rim only has 3; but it does make for an ideal quiet getaway.''East Rim:''(~5 hours from Las Vegas, opens year-round)''The East Rim has several highlights such as the Little Colorado River Tribal Park; but the most notable one would be the picturesque Horseshoe Bend which gives its visitors the chance to have their pictures taken from the rim with the Colorado River in the background (a sight that is not possible from the North or South Rim).''West Rim:''(~3 hours from Las Vegas, opens year-round)''This is the closest and most accessible portion of the Grand Canyon from Las Vegas with notable spots like the Glass SkyWalk, Eagle Point, Guano Point, etc. As such, this is the 2nd most visited location of the 4 rims.

And as I stepped in to the vehicle, I could instantly see why it has been called as ‘luxurious yet rugged’: everything was spacious, the seats were oh-so-comfortable, and the windows were surely large enough to give panoramic views of the Nevada landscape.''While I continued to ogle at the car’s features, we went to pick up the other tour participants in their respective hotels (which didn’t take too long because pick-up time was early, hence no nasty traffic). After this, wee started to cruise through the desert and our first stop took us to the massive''Hoover Dam''as we passed by the glittering waters of''Lake Mead''.\xa0If you’re much like me who doesn’t know much about this dam, let me tell you a bit of trivia: apparently, this used to be the tallest dam in the world! Today however, it is lauded as the largest reservoir in the United States by volume when it is full, and its generators continue to provide power not only for Nevada but also for the Arizona and California states.''We took our time here taking photos (as well as buying souvenirs in a nearby shop at the topmost viewing point); so feel free to do the same — the Pink Jeep Tours’ guide will even be more than happy to help you out on your photos.''Once that was done with, we continued to make our way to the Grand Canyon so that we can soon embark on our amazing helicopter tour. For the meantime, we just sat back in the trekker and enjoyed the smooth ride whilst we went through the state’s dry terrain — which mind you, contains the unique spike-leafed evergreens which are known for being the fast-growers of the desert: the''Joshua Trees.''NOTE'': If time permits, your Pink Jeep Tour guide will gladly pass by the''Mojave Desert''(the driest desert in North America),''or even the Arizona side of the Hoover Dam''(for great photo ops with a backdrop of the Colorado River’s turquoise waters.)''»''Fly''Top photo of helicopter from''Shutterstock.com''After our drive, we reached the edge of the Grand Canyon’s West Rim and it was here that I started to get even more excited''(then again, who wouldn’t be?)''. When I got off our trekker, I started to saw glimpses of the natural wonder’s sheer majesty and in a heartbeat, I just couldn’t wait to board our helicopter so that we can get a better view of it all —''up high!''Pink Jeep Tours partners with either''Sundance Helicopters''or Papillon Helicopters for this flying experience and during our particular adventure, we went with the former. To start the process, Sundance each took our weight, made us watch a safety video and gradually directed us to the take-off area. Thankfully, me and my companion’s combined weight gave us the opportunity to go at the front seats besides the pilot that’s why you can imagine how our excitement was shooting through the roof! (…This wasn’t my first time to''ride a helicopter''but the thrill and excitement always remains!)''To cut the story short, our luxury Sundance helicopter arrived a few minutes later and after we were strapped securely in our seats, it took us 4,000 feet into the deeper parts of the canyon… and oh boy, it was such a sight!''Everywhere I looked, I saw breathtaking panoramic views that each have their own distinct shape and hues — proof of the wondrous erosion that spanned for about 6 million years through 4 geologic eras.''Just when I thought that it couldn’t get any better — it did. After all, our adventure didn’t stop here.''»''Float''Our helicopter landed on a spot somewhere beside a section of the''Colorado River''that was surrounded by towering and picturesque red cliffs.''It was in here that we did the ‘''floating''‘ part of the Pink Jeep Tours experience and it basically involved an excursion pontoon boat by the Hualapai River Runners.\xa0For several minutes, we glided through the mighty Colorado River so that we can get better views up close of the rock formations and lush vegetation. The boat driver slash guide even gave us some interesting bits of info about the place so that was a huge plus.''»''Eat''After the helicopter tour and before the rest of the day’s sightseeing sprees, we made our final stop at''Guano Point''where our Pink Jeep Tours guide gave us the time to enjoy lunch and the surrounding highlights of the Grand Canyon’s West Rim.''Regarding our meal, it was a legitimate ‘''lunch with a view’''affair at''Guano Deli''that was\xa0full of savory dishes of BBQ shredded beef, baked chicken, salads and more while we admire the dazzling views around us. It was pure bliss!''»''Explore''Top photo of Grand Canyon Skywalk from''Shutterstock.com''Guano Point is a strategic place to view dramatic viewpoints of the Grand Canyon West Rim. Below are just some of the many things that we did — and which you can do — in this amazing spot!''View the Eagle Point.''From the moment that you step off the bus, you will find this amazing natural red rock formation which seemingly has a figure of an eagle in its middle portion and this is actually considered as sacred by the\xa0Hualapai Indians. Take your time taking photos here; but take note that there are no railings so you should be careful where you step foot on. Once you’re done, you will find a small Native American Village nearby that has replicas of authentic dwellings from various American Indian Tribes which give you a glimpse of a\xa0simpler time when Hualapai, Navajo, Plains, Hopi, Havasupi, and other Indian tribes roamed the lands.''Experience to the Grand Canyon Skywalk.''Wanna stand on the edge of the Grand Canyon? If your answer is a resounding ‘yes’, then you shouldn’t miss a stopover at the Skywalk. Entrance is at $25 per person which is not included in this Pink Jeep Tours experience’s base price (however, you can arrange it ahead of time). This place was built in 2007 and it’s a daring 10-foot wide horseshoe-shaped glass bridge that extends 70 feet out of the West Rim, granting you unobstructed views of the Grand Canyon at 4,000 feet below. Truth be told, this engineering marvel has been profiled by big names like CNN and the National Geographic so it’s quite a must-do! Rest assured, this structure can bear the weight of over 747 passenger jets — so no worries there. (''NOTE'': Cameras are NOT permitted on the Skywalk).''TRIVIA'': Back in the 30s, a guano cave (full of accumulated excrement which is a highly effective fertilizer) was discovered and the U.S. Guano Corporation bought the area and constructed a million-worth aerial tramway system to extract the guano from the mine — to what is now known as Guano Point.''.''PRE-TRAVEL GUIDE''Where to get the best flight deals to Las Vegas?''My go-to platforms for grabbing the best flight deals are''Momondo'',''Kayak'', and''Skyscanner''.

However, during the summer, it might be a bit too hot so do take note of that.''By private car.''There are still some hotels on the Strip that provide free parking for a few hours even if you’re a non-guest; either way, it’s advisable not to drive at length on the Strip during the weekends because traffic can get pretty nasty.''By taxi.''It’s relatively cheap to use a taxi from one hotel to another, but take note that due to traffic and certain routes, your fare can go higher. If coming with a large group, you can consider hiring a limousine which you can typically rent for a few hours too (it will be cheaper than taxing multiple taxis together with your friends, and faster too to evade long waits at the taxi queue).''By monorail''.\xa0Las Vegas has a monorail on the east side of the Strip which stops at the back entrance of hotels. It costs $5 one way, $9 return, and $15 one daypass — however, please do your calculations beforehand because taking a taxi is often more efficient.''By public transportation''. There are several buses available for you to choose from, and a common one is RTC which has about 49 bus routes.

That being said, it was quite tough to choose the villa that we really wanted (I wanted them all)… but eventually, we found the best one for us called and it was called''Finca Can Mos.''It was a gorgeous stone villa that had 4 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, two swimming pools (one of which was an indoor pool that was styled like a Roman Bath), a fully-equipped kitchen, an indoor dining area, a living room, an outdoor BBQ with outdoor dining table, an outdoor pingpong table, an indoor gym, a spacious garden with fruit trees for picking, and a foosball.''Now of course, I know how some photos can be deceiving but from the moment that we drove into Finca Can Mos’ private gravel driveway and then stepped inside its doors, everything looked as it was online — if not better!''Every room and space in the house was clean and spacious, decked with sturdy furniture and adorned with beautiful decorations that made us feel that it hasn’t been lived in before. After some time of ‘ogling’, we all visited the four bedrooms in this villa in Mallorca, and each couple immediately picked out their favorites. Jonas and I settled into the master bedroom which had a sizeable king-sized bed, walk-in closet, work area, and bathroom. (Mind you, our bathtub was even a jetted tub!)''Outside would be the vast garden and 10-meter pool which had a picturesque backdrop of the town’s surrounding Puig de Maria mountain range. For the duration of our stay, we had a lot of fun doing mini parties in the garden, grilling some BBQ, making fresh juices (from the garden’s orange, lime and lemon trees), basking under the sun, tiring ourselves silly from playing in the pool, holding pingpong matches, going on nearby hikes, heading out on day-long road trips, doing movie + karaoke nights, etc.''For the fitness buffs — don’t fret! Their gym has a lot of good equipment; if not, Pollenca’s surrounding trails or even just the town itself makes for a great place to go out on a run for. After all, the neighborhood in Finca Can Mos was truly pleasant and peaceful. We even chatted with some of the neighbours around us and found out that the people beside the villa in Mallorca were actually the owners and they were so very kind!''• NOTE:''By the way, we had a kid with us and it was a nice surprise to find toys by the foosball so Brent (Jonas’ nephew) had a lot of fun while we there in the villa in Mallorca. Also, we only stayed here for a week but if you were to stay more, the linens will be changed after a week. (Towels and a light cleaning spree will be done every mid-week). Nevertheless, there are enough cleaning supplies available if in case you make a mess of your surroundings (which is really appreciated given that we did have a kid with us).''• PRICE:''Finca Can Mos was priced at around $3,000 a week. If your budget is tighter, there are an array of other stunning villa listings in Travelopo that will surely fit your needs.''.''»''The Mallorcan Adventures & Escapades''The island is a treasure trove of all sorts of rural, urban, land and water adventures! As expected, the location of our villa in Mallorca was a prime spot since there were tons of noteworthy attractions that were just a few minutes away. And if your aim is to visit the capital which is Palma de Mallorca, it will be just a 40-minute drive away by car.''To give you an idea of what we have managed to do during our week-long stay, below are some of the memorable activities that we did!''◘◘''Explored the town of Pollenca''Located at the north-eastern side of the island, Pollenca is a charming little town that’s nestled at the feet of the Serra de Tramuntana mountain chain on Mallorca’s northern coast. Its name comes from the Roman settlement of “Pollentia” which are the excataved remains that lie in Alcúdia (a municipality located a few kilometers away). From the first time that we strolled through this town, I instantly fell in love with its postcard-perfect views of small stone houses that were confined in narrow streets! Some of the things we did that you must do are to…''Visit Plaça Major on Sundays:''This is the town’s central square that is dominated by the large 13th century church of ‘Our Lady of the Angels’ (Esglèsia de Nostra Senyora dels Àngels) and filled with cozy outdoor cafes. During Sundays, you must stop by around 8:00 in the morning in order to see the square come alive with stalls that are filled with food, crafts, shoes, clothes, and greens! (The stalls stretch out to the nearby streets as well as Ca Les Monnares Square. By 1:00PM, the market closes).''Do the 365 Calvari Steps:''As the name implies this is a long climb and also a steep one too as it leads from the central square up to a small old chapel called as Calvario (which has great panoramic views over the town). On Easter, these steps are the famous setting for a dramatic religious procession that re-enacts the Stations of the Cross.''Do a Tapas Route:''Every Thursday from 8:00PM until midnight, there are about 13 eateries in Pollenca who offer a glass of beer or wine and tapas for a set of €2 only! It’s an amazing way to acquaint yourself with local delicacies and restaurants in town and we absolutely had so much fun doing this. Just look out for flyers at the tourist office or posters in the center to see the participating 13 eateries for the week (since they change monthly).''◘◘''Climb up Puig de Maria''Puig de Maria is a prominent hill in Pollenca and its monastery, the''‘Santuari de la Mare de Déu del Pui’''stands tall at the top overlooking the town. We decided to climb this up and the trail was easy to find off the main road (Ma-2200) given that it had a lot of helpful signposts that led the way. At an ascent of over 2km, the climb up can be done in just less than an hour and once you reach the monastery, it will offer you grand views over Pollenca, its port, and the surrounding countryside.''◘◘''Drive to Cap de Formentor''This spectacular cape that’s also called as the ‘Meeting point of the winds’ is a the most northern point of the island and I can guarantee you that the scenery here is incredible beyond words when you see it with your own eyes! The best part? It’s just a 20km drive from Pollenca. So make sure that you make a stop by Formentor beach, the viewpoint called as Mirador des Colomer, as well as the Formentor Lighthouse at the end of the road. (If you are a cycling enthusiast, you should definitely bike through this route).''◘◘''Visit the capital, Palma de Mallorca''This is not only the capital of Mallorca but it is also the largest city of the autonomous community of the Balearic islands in Spain. In this place, we witnessed some of its top landmarks, namely…''Eat and drink at\xa0Mercat de L’Olivar:''This market shows a dazzling display of local goods that come at very good rates! Open from Monday to Thursday (from 7:00AM to 2:30PM), Fridays (7:00AM to 8:00PM), and Saturdays (7:00AM to 3:00PM), you can also hang out at some of the tapas bars to enjoy a glass of sangria, champagne, brandy and whatnot.''Witness the\xa0Cathedral of Santa Maria of Palma and\xa0L’Almudaina Palace:''The cathedral that’s commonly called as ‘La Sea’ is a Gothich Roman Catholic cathedral that’s quite a sight near the bay. Beside it, you will find the\xa0royal palace of La Almudaina which looks like an Arabian fortress. This used to be a royal residence but today, it is owned by the Spanish government and operated by an agency of the Minister of Presidency that manages assets of the State for the Crown (and also used as an offidical residence for ceremonies and State receptions).''Drop by\xa0Bellver Castle:''This Gothic-style castle was built in the 14th century for King James II of Majorca and one of the few circular castles that you can find in Europe. Once a residence for Kings and later on a military prison, it’s now a public tourist attraction where the city’s History Museum can be found.''◘◘''Stroll through the town of Alcúdia''This is an old town in the north near Pollenca that is well preserved; truth be told, it has houses that date back to the 13th century, some remains of a Roman town in front of the Church of St. Jaume, as well as a high medieval wall that surrounds the old town. Other than seeing these sights, we also had a swell time going through its shopping streets inside the old town!''◘◘''Go and explore the rest of the island in a car''I would highly recommend getting a rental car when in Mallorca as it gives you the freedom to explore the rest of the island and discover less crowded beaches. Other than the trips we made to some of the amazing places near Pollenca, we also drove around aimlessly during our last day. Together with Jonas’ parents, Beatrix and Walter, we ended up seeing amazing viewpoints along the\xa0Serra de Tramuntana Panta mountain range, and we even witnessed''Panta de Gorg Blau''(a lake) which is a breathtaking artificial reservoir that provides water to the city of Palma and the surrounding areas.''.''PRE-TRAVEL GUIDE''Where to get the best flight deals to Mallorca?''My go-to platforms for grabbing the best flight deals are''Momondo'',''Kayak'', and''Skyscanner''. But of course, it’s always good practice to research first the budget airlines that exist in the country that you’re currently staying in, since they could have rock-bottom prices that are not often visible in the above flight search engines (example: RyanAir is one of the cheapest airlines to fly with if you’re flying from somewhere in Europe).''The main airport in Mallorca is called as Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI).''When is the best months to visit Mallorca?''It would be the off peak season with mild temperatures that spans from March to May . Summer would start from June to September but that would mean hotter temperatures, higher rates, and more hordes of tourists! Otherwise,\xa0visiting Mallorca during fall or winter is an option too (October to December); but expect some rains on some days and colder temperatures.''What’s the best way to go around Mallorca?''There is inland public transportation but it becomes severely limited if you go out further to the more rural areas (it becomes even more limited during lower season and during night time). Nevertheless, transportation between major holiday resorts in the center will not pose to be a problem at all.''That being said, it’s really''best to rent a car for your own''especially if you’re going to spend some time in the island. You can hire a car at the airport without reservation but it’s always best to book in advance (as rates will also be better online too).''On the other hand, if you’re here for a short time, it’s better to just join a conducted tour that will take you to the main spots around the island.''Helpful Spanish phrases''People in Mallorca speak Spanish and Mallorquí (a local variatn of Catalán).

After I had the chance to visit this small yet vibrant country this year, I’ve come to see that such a claim is true! After all, Taiwan has several bustling night markets that are absolutely packed with an array of delicious food to eat. In the capital of Taipei itself, you’ll find a handful of interesting spots — for this post, I will rather be focusing on the oldest one in Songshan District:''Raohe Night Market!''Spanning at about 600 meters long, this single pedestrian lane that stretches along Raohe street may not be as big as the Shilin Night Market in the city, but with its size, it’s more compact and less touristy; so, it’s perfect especially if you want a place that’s easier to navigate and easier to browse through.''Now of course, there is a wide range of local and international food selections to find here and if I were to list them all, it would probably take me a while! That being said, what I will be featuring below would be the top dishes and drinks that caught my eye and which you should definitely NOT miss.''READ:''Taiwan Itinerary Guide for 3 Days & More!''.''Where to Stay in Taipei?''Come and check out my list of the ‘''Best Hotels in Taipei''‘ which features the top recommended choices for cheap to luxurious accommodation choices.''.''What to Eat at Raohe Street Night Market''#1''Pork Pepper Buns''(Hújiāo Bǐng)''This type of baked bun actually originated from the Fuzhou region of China but it is commonly referred to as the “Taiwanese Pepper Bun” due to its high popularity in the country. It has several variations; but typically, they are made of chewy dough filled with a mixture of minced pork (sometimes beef), scallions, sugar, soy sauce, and black pepper.''Best shop stall to eat it from?''Fu Zhou Shi Zu''which is at Raohe Night Market’s ornate entrance. It’s hard to miss because you will see a long line of customers! But I’m telling you, it’s worth the wait (which isn’t too long, I only had to wait for 10 minutes). While waiting, I even had the chance to watch their overall cooking process up until it was baked in a cylinder-like heat oven — so yes, they serve it fresh! Plus, it’s cheap too at just NT$50 each (or\xa0$1.6~ or Php 80~).''#2''Grilled Squid''Squid is a famed snack in the country and the larger ones are usually marinated and then grilled. I saw two ways of serving the squid: either spread out flat or sliced into rings.''At this point, you probably think that the squid is chewy; but in fact, it’s not! It has a nice texture in which the ‘meat’ is tender. The spice that they put on the squid also helps give a nice kick to it all.''Price starts at NT$100; rest assured the serving is big so you can share it with your companion.''#3''Pork Rib Bone Soup''It’s commonly believed that cooking meat on the bone helps improve its flavor and texture, and Taiwan’s pork rib bone soup is a prime example that you can enjoy!''In Raohe, you will find a lot of stalls (typically the one with seats) who serve this kind of fare. I was told that this kind of dish is similar to Singapore’s''bak ku teh'', but Taiwan’s version has a more herb-y flavor and spice. One thing’s for sure though: this is easily the kind of comfort food that I can consume and it tasted even better when paired with rice!''(Price\xa0starts at about NT$90.)''#4''Stinky Tofu''As the name implies, stinky (fermented) tofu is distinct for its strong odor which is quite unique. Truth be told, it’s said that the smellier it is, the better it tastes; but personally, I think it’s an acquired taste. Still, that doesn’t stop travelers from trying it out to see why the locals love this fare. So if you’re up for the challenge, why not give it a try?''Stinky tofu in Raohe is often sold cold, steamed, stewed or deep fried. I suggest going for the deep fried sort which is often served together with a special sauce and some minced garlic.''TIP'': As it is stinky, be prepared that your breath might equally end up the same way *wink* Don’t forget to pack some mints!''#5''Torched Beef Cubes''There are several stalls that sell this kind of food in Raohe Night Market, and as the name implies, they are bite-sized chunks of beef that are flame-grilled or torched on the spot as customers place an order.''It’s a simple fare but it makes for a very juicy savory food to munch on as you walk along the street. When you buy one, you are also given the choice to choose the kind of toppings or seasonings that you like such as salt, cumin, pepper, or teriyaki.''TIP'': Try the rose pink salt toppings which is loved by many!''(Price starts at around NT$200).''#6''Beef Noodle''You must NEVER leave Taiwan without trying a bowl of beef noodle! It’s well loved by the Taiwanese that''Taipei even holds an annual festival''for it in which people would compete to make the best bowl.''So basically, this noodle soup is made up of tender stewed or red braised beef mixed in beef broth together with vegetables and Chinese noodles. I’ve tried this myself and it’s a delicious and aromatic bowl of goodness!''(Price: NT$90).''#7''Sausages''(Xiang Chang)'"There are various Chinese sausages and the one that was adapted by Taiwan is called as ‘xiangchang'(香腸) which literally means fragrant sausage."'These chunky, fresh and plump sausages consist of coarsely chopped pieces of pork and un-rendered pork fat — and often more sugar than typical Chinese sausages so you will detect a sweet aftertaste when you take a bite.''When in Raohe Night Market, you’ll find several shops selling these sausages in skewers with several options for sauces to dip it in. If you ask me, they’re worth trying! (Price starts at NT$30).''#8''Xiaolongbao''Xiaolongbao is a type of steamed bun or soup dumpling that originated from China, but if I may so myself, it’s Taiwan’s famous restaurant of''Din Tai Fung''that ushered it to popularity!\xa0Naturally, almost every night market in Taiwan sells these dumplings in case you can’t be bothered to wait in line for long hours at any of the restaurant’s chain stores. In Raohe Night Market, there’s a small shop on the side near the ornate gates who sells it freshly-cooked and you will have clear view of the men who are making it.''NOTE'': If it’s your first time to eat this'',''take note it has hot soup ‘inside’ so don’t stuff it all in your mouth.\xa0It’s best to take a small bite on the side to slowly drain the soup out before swallowing it all whole. Feel free to dip it in vinegar and fresh ginger that they usually provide.''India''is one of the few remaining countries in Asia that I haven’t managed to visit —''until this year!''That’s why you can imagine how stoked I was when I first found out that I’ll be setting foot in its soil; after all, I’ve heard a LOT of great things about India’s culture, food, people and sights. Back then though, when my itinerary was finalized, I checked the immigration requirements and… I was surprised when I discovered that I had to get an Indian visa first before entering the country.''I say this because I once heard that there was a visa-on-arrival scheme to a lot of nationalities (such as mine), but apparently, by 2014 they have changed it into an''online ETA (Electronic Travel Authorization) or E-Tourist Visa application''.''Top photo of''Taj Mahal''from Shutterstock.com''»''What is India’s E-Tourist Visa?''In November 2014, the ETA (Electronic Travel Authorization) or “E-Tourist Visa” (now aptly called as “E-Visa”) replaced the special visa-on-arrival policy in India and it is divided into 3 categories, namely:''E-Tourist Visa''E-Business Visa''E-Medical Visa''This might sound like a hassle to you, but I assure you:''it is very easy to apply for an Indian visa or E-Visa''because the process is fast, simple and straightforward. I was successful in applying for this in just a day and below is an Indian visa guide that will also help you make you India travel dreams come true!''…But first, a''disclaimer'':''NO ONE''can give you a guarantee\xa0on your Indian visa’s approval\xa0—\xa0not even a lawyer, a consultant, a travel agent, or an embassy employee.\xa0Anyone who says otherwise is most likely going to be a scammer.\xa0That being said, what I can offer you here is a comprehensive guide with helpful tips to''increase''your chances of getting that Indian tourist visa.''.''Earlier this year,''a certain video on Facebook went viral''and it showed this unique set of modular bags that can be''combined, swapped or separated''so that it can transform into a backpack that will suit your needs — may it be for daily use, work, travel, etc. After a bit of research, I discovered that the brand''Wool and Oak''was the company behind this amazing''‘Voyager Set’.''I’ve seen a lot of modern ‘inventions’ for bags and whatnot in the past years, but the way that Wool and Oak designed and compartmentalized this set was just simply superb. So I knew right then and there that I needed to have it and give it a whirl!\xa0Besides, going by my''travel lifestyle'', it’s certainly the kind of ‘carry-on’ system that would fit my very needs of staying organized''yet''minimal without overpacking.''Fortunately, Wool and Oak gave me the chance to give their Voyager Set a try (I was stoked when they did!). As of this moment, the bags have been with me for months now and to cut the story short:''it is everything that I expected it to be — and MORE!''.''Wool and Oak''Wool & Oak''[website]''is a lifestyle brand that was founded in 2015 by Jonathan Webster in Manhattan. As someone who was trained in fashion design back in Rome – Italy, Jonathan ensures that the combination of aesthetics and function is always present in the premium leather goods that they make for the modern world.''TRIVIA'': The company’s big break happened in 2016 when they debuted with''the World’s First Duffle Suitcase on Kickstarter''. With over thousands of backers worldwide, it helped validate the fact that Wool and Oak created a product that was a perfect fit to what travelers wanted and needed.''Today, the brand thrives to continue delivering meaningful innovation not only for travelers’ gear but also for any other stagnant product categories.\xa0…With that said, you bet that I’m quite excited for what they will come up with next!''.''»''Why I love Wool and Oak items?''They have a special knack for innovating new styles that are extremely practical.''Their talent for ‘design innovation’ is perfectly seen not only from their''Duffle Suitcase’s construction'', but also from their newest''Duffle Backpack’s (Voyager Set’s)''storage system.

Not only that, but they also made sure that their designs stay sleek and applicable for formal and informal uses.''“Style meets function”''is a tagline that they typically use and\xa0it’s absolutely fitting for their brand!''.''They always keep their users in mind.''“What would a daily commuter need to have for their bag?”, “What would a traveler want to rather have on their carry-on?”''or''“''What would an employee wish to have as a briefcase?”''Wool and Oak clearly puts attention to these kinds of questions because it shows in the products that they make. For instance, in the aspect of promoting ease, they incorporated on their Voyager Set the ‘Quick Zip Connection’ feature so that you can expand or minimize your bags quickly — there’s NO more need to pack or switch between multiple bags as you go about your lifestyle.''.''Their products are versatile.''With varying features and designs on their bags, it can easily adapt to any kind of lifestyle that you lead.

In fact, their bags are made of genuine''full grain Italian leather''. With that in mind, you might think that they might lean on the heavy side; however, I can assure you that their bags are as lightweight as they can be. Rest assured, if you don’t fancy leather, Wool and Oak also makes their bags in canvas.''.''They have great customer service.''They value each and every customer so you are always assured of a\xa05-star service.

They are called as''shokuhin sampuru''(サンプル) — a term derived from the word ‘sample’ — and they are basically the real-looking fake food displays that you see at the entrance of most Japanese restaurants (used as a way of enticing customers).''Not a lot of people know (but now you do!) that it is in''Gujo Hachiman''where''80% of Japan’s food samples are made'', thereby making the town a\xa0lucrative and leading manufacturer of''sampuru''in the country.

During those times, he was inspired by how the melting wax perfectly molded on the shape of the''tatami''mat. After a while, he started to work on this idea as he tried to make a realistic wax omelet.''He was inspired by the wax replicas of organs or body parts that were used in medicinal studies, so he decided to apply the same idea to food.''Anyhow, fortunately for Iwasaki, the time was right for introducing his''sampuru''inventions. He opened his first factory in''Osaka''in 1932 but he swiftly returned to his hometown,''Gifu''to establish''Iwasaki Mokei''or Sample Village Iwasaki. Business caught on with this and soon, one of Tokyo’s major department stores implemented Iwasaki’s''sampuru''and it was a success! Today, Iwasaki Co. Ltd. remains to be a blooming business.''You might be wondering…''how\xa0exactly did''sampuru''become such a booming industry?''Well, humans are visual creatures — much more for the Japanese who like to “taste first with their eyes”! So naturally, seeing these''sampuru''displays in front of restaurants have helped made their dishes look appetizing and have also helped give an idea to the consumers about what they are going to get if they order a certain dish (thereby enticing customers) a.\xa0For sure, you can see the visuals in a menu but to blow up those pictures and display them as life-like displays certainly makes it more of a great advertisement tactic! (It is also a helpful thing for foreigners who wouldn’t know how to read Japanese characters).''Some interesting trivia about''sampuru:''Making a food replica or''sampuru''typically costs 10 or 20 times more than the dish’s actual value!''It used to be made of wax, but today, workshops now make food replicas with plastic or durable polyvinyl chloride (PVC) that are more long-lasting and more life-like.''.''»''Where to Make''Sampuru''in''Gujo Hachiman''?''From the 4 workshops in''Gujo,''there are 2 famous establishments: Sample Village Iwasaki and\xa0Sample Kobo.''Sample Village Iwasaki''Hours'':\xa010:00AM to 4:00PM (classes until 3:00PM)''Closed'':\xa0Tuesdays, 1st Thursday in October, 1st Saturday in February, New Year holidays''Admission'': FREE to enter, but for classes, price start from \u200e¥\u200e800 to ¥1,200''Sample Kobo''Hours'': 9:00AM to 5:00PM (extended hours during the Gujo Odori festival)''Closed'':\xa0Thursdays (except in summer) and New Year holidays''Admission'':\xa0FREE to enter, but for classes, price start from \u200e¥900 to ¥3,000''Website'':''http://samplekobo.com/''Even though Sample Village Iwasaki has more selections, it is rather located a bit far (1 kilometer) outside the town center and they also don’t allow visitors to have a look inside their workshops.\xa0Sample Kobo, on the other hand, is in the town center and they even allow visitors to go inside their workshop to watch artisans create the''sampuru''that they make in their store.''That being said, me and my companions ended up visiting Sample Kobo instead.''In their establishment, you will first step in to their souvenir shop that sells an array of big and small''sampuru''that are also modeled into key holders, magnets, mobile straps and others. I especially loved the huge beer glass that was smacked in the middle, the ridiculously real-looking tangerines, as well as the coffee cans on the floor that looked like they were spilled.''Further in, you will then find their sample exhibition. The staff can offer you a quick ‘quiz session’ to test if you can properly differentiate the real one from the fake one. Since meat or seafood can easily spoil in these display cases, they rather featured not-so-easily-perishable items like cookies and other snacks/sweets… and well, I swear to you! I may be a huge food lover and also a decent cook, but it was so difficult telling things apart — which just shows how much work and detail are being put into these''sampuru''.''Going further into their workshop you will find their production studio near the courtyard where you can watch their staff make''sampuru''LIVE.

We left our bags in the shelves and each put on an apron. At this point, it was clear to see that the staff mostly didn’t speak English — rest assured, the demonstrations later on were very simple so even if you don’t have a translator with you, booking here should be no problem.''Now, first up, we did the''tempura''activity. If you come here solo, you can choose the kind of food that you will do in''tempura''style: it can be a shrimp or the other kinds of vegetables available. But if you come in a group (which I did), the standard offering for making the''tempura''is the shrimp or''ebi''in Japanese.''Since this was supposed to be a more simplified lesson, we didn’t do the part where we had to make the plastic shrimp; hence, it was already prepared/made beforehand.''As for making the shrimp''tempura'', I was instructed to slowly and gradually drip hot wax into the cold water basin. I had to do it in a way that it will later on look like a tempura coating (this sounds difficult but if you watch my video above, you’ll see how easy it will be).''Once that’s done with, I placed the plastic shrimp on top and then gently wrap it with the wax (that now looked like fried flour batter)… and that’s it!''When I looked at my ‘creation’, I certainly felt giddy! It''really''looked like a freshly-fried''tempura.''After this was the making of the lettuce or cabbage —''in which the difficulty rose up a little bit.''And so, in the same concept as the batter-looking wax for the''tempura'', I had to pour wax into the cold water. BUT this time around, it was a mix of white and green wax wherein I had to pour the green one on top of the white. Afterwards, I had to slowly pull the white end under the water until the green part extends.''For this, it was absolutely amazing to see how the wax gradually started to look like the skin of a lettuce!''Next, I cut the wax in half. I scrunched up the other half into a ball and then made the other half a wrap as I ‘try’ to make it look like a true''baby''lettuce. Now this is the part where it involved a bit of luck and skill — mine almost didn’t look like one… haha! But I could still easily fool someone into thinking that it’s the real deal.''We all took turns doing this, and during the time that I was watching the others do it, I continued to look in awe at the overall process while I wondered about the different amazing techniques that they have to do to recreate all the other kinds of food and dishes out there!''For sure, this is an activity that I would recommend to anyone — no matter the age because it is such a cool and fun experience to do.''.''PRE-TRAVEL GUIDE''How to reach Gujo Hachiman?''From Tokyo.''You need to get to''Nagoya''first.

The\xa0Faroe Islands or''Føroyar''are quite far from Denmark; truth be told, its 18 rocky and volcanic islands are closer to Iceland, Norway and Scotland. But one important thing to mention is that though Denmark is part of the European Union, the Faroe Islands are not.''TRIVIA'': One of the inhabited islands,\xa0Koltur, has''only one''resident! (…Or two, because I keep seeing conflicting info online; but some of the locals said that there’s only one left there. Maybe they were talking about 1 family which are these 2 residents.)''.''Locals are called as ‘''Faroese''‘.''They are of mixed Norse and Gaelic origins and number at about 50,000 only in the 17 inhabited islands (but there is an estimated number of 21,000 Faroese living in neighbouring countries). The language is also called as Faroese but Danish still has equal status in all official affairs. If I say so myself, I''looove''the language here. Every word sounds like it sprang out from books like Lord of the Rings!''TRIVIA'': The\xa0Faroese language is said to be one of the North Germanic languages and it is closely related to Icelandic and the now extinct Old Norse Language. Anyhow, English is widely spoken especially by the younger ones.''.''The sheep are taking over.''The nation’s symbol is the ram, and rightly so because the Faroe Islands is''packed''with 70,000 sheep!!! Remember how there are about 50,000 people living here? Without a doubt… they’re outnumbered! And as a tourist, you’ll certainly find sheep as your typical surrounding companion — much like I have.''TRIVIA'': The name of the islands first appeared as''Faereyjar''(in 1225) which means “Sheep Islands” that was given by the Viking age settlers from Norway in the 9th century.''When is the best time to visit the Faroe Islands?''Weather here can be quite unpredictable. It’s common to somewhat experience all 4 seasons in just one day! But yes, generally, sunny days here are rare because the islands are mostly windy, cloudy and chilly.\xa0For starters, expect cool summers (with an average temperature of 13°C) and mild winters (with an average temperature of 3°C). I went here in the summer around end of June and the days can''really''have long hours of sunlight with the sun setting after 11PM or even later! (The longest day will be in June 21 spanning at almost 20 hours). As for winter, it can be as short as 5 hours — imagine that…''With all that said, it’s best to visit the archipelago around June to September to enjoy the green scenery. Don’t forget to pack your jacket! ;)''How to get to the Faroe Islands?''By air.''There are currently 2 airlines that fly to the Faroe Islands. First is\xa0Atlantic Airways that has 2 flights per day from Copenhagen, Billund, Aalborg, Bergen and Reykjavik. Flighs cannot\xa0be booked through travel websites so you’ll have to book directly on Atlantic Airways website''here''. The other one is Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) that just started having daily flights to the Faroes last March 2017.''By sea.''Smyril Line’s ferry,''M/S Norröna, sails to the Faroe Islands from Hirtshals in the north of Denmark and from Seyðisfjørður in Iceland. It doesn’t sail as frequent though so make sure to check by its website for the scheduled departures.''What kind of clothes should I pack?''If you’re coming around May to September to the the Faroe Islands, you should pack for chilly weather so your bare essentials should be a sweater, a raincoat, and a set of good comfortable (hiking) shoes. If you’re like me who can get cold quite fast, go and pack a warm hat or even some gloves just in case!''Of course if you visit around winter or the colder months, your clothing essentials will be different. \xa0The same goes for when you’re coming here mainly to camp or hike.''Where to best stay (for accommodations)?''The central city of Tórshavn is where you will find most of the accommodations and it’s a strategic place to base yourself in for all your adventures around the islands. (Of course it can get cheaper if you get places outside of \xa0Torshavn, but for the best capital picks, they would be the following).''Luxury:''Hotel Foroyar''/\xa0Mid-Range:''Hotel Hafnia''or''AirBnB''/\xa0Budget:''Kristjanshavn''or''AirBnB''How can I go around the islands?''By car.''Driving your own car is highly recommended (to make the most of your time!) and\xa0you can arrange a rental online before your arrival on the islands. Rest assured, you can rent a car (from small cars to SUVs) on-the-spot when you land\xa0at the airport since there are\xa0stalls there by Sixt, AVIS, HERTZ, and Unicar. Once you start driving around the Faroe Islands, be mindful of the driving conditions and rules because for instance, there are one-way tunnels in the islands and you have to make way for incoming vehicles (you can find all the details in''here'').''By bus.''The main\xa0inter-town bus that they have is called Bygdaleiðir (they’re easy to spot since they’re big and in the color of dark blue). To see the complete timetable of the buses, go''here''.\xa0It helps to note, however, that public transportation is expensive in the Faroe Islands, so it’s best to buy a travel (multiple-ride) card\xa0beforehand with Strandfaraskip Landsins (the mother company of Bygdaleiðir) at the airport or at the main bus terminal in Torshavn. This\xa0travel card already covers busses and ferries around the islands (except to Mykines Island) and can cost 500 DKK ($70~ / Php 3,500~) for 4-days or 700 DKK ($100 / Php 4,900~) for 7 days.''By ferry or by helicopter.''Since this place is made up of islands, some are not connected by roads so you’ll sometimes need to hop on a ferry. The schedules for this can be found on''Strandfaraskip Landsins.''Now if a helicopter ride seemingly sounds expensive to you, don’t worry! Here in the islands, the service is subsidized by the government so it’s quite cheap and it is serviced by Atlantic Airways (see timetable''here'', and remember, booking in advance is mandatory). With these affordable helicopter rides, I say take advantage of it!''By bike.''Some districts like the capital, Tórshavn, can be explored on city or sports bikes. You can rent these from\xa0Visit Tórshavn that is located in Steinatún in the city centre. The cost for a day can start at DKK 150~. To book, just send an e-mail to''[email\xa0protected]''or call (+298) 302425.''What tour operators can I contact?''In case you don’t like to DIY your trip and want to have someone take care of everything for you, I suggest that you book through local operators in order to help support the local economy.

In fact, you’ll find yourself snapping away non-stop when you visit Niigata because first off, in spring, all the beautiful flowers start to bloom in their best.''Of course, the famous cherry blossoms (''sakura'') are a given but what you probably didn’t know is that because of Niigata’s prime geographical location, it enjoys''a longer\xa0period of sakura season which lasts for more than one month''. A must to visit for this would be''Takada''Castle’s''Sakura''Road that is filled with over 4,000''sakura''trees that are lit up by 3,000 paper lanterns (come around the first week of April for this). Other than this, Niigata also takes pride in its carpet of fields that are bountiful with tulips; this is naturally so because the prefecture ranks as #1 in tulip production in the country. Must-see tulip fields are''Tanai''and''Gosen''city.''Come summer, Niigata’s long coastline comes into play\xa0with its rugged cliffs, clear blue seas, and white sandy beaches.\xa0Along with this would be the advent of festivals or matsuri and Niigata is known in Japan as having weekly shows of fireworks.''(See point #7 below in this post to know more about this.)''When autumn starts to crawl in, it becomes harvest time for Niigata’s prized''koshihikari''rice\xa0so you’ll find endless golden paddies.

It just so happens that scenes like that were ‘normal’ to me; so in order to get a more exuberant reaction from me, it has to be far more incredible (''Faroe Islands''would be an example).''Naturally, as a local, a lot of you have been asking me for tips and top''things to do in Batanes''. When this was first asked of me, I was at a complete loss because I left the islands when it wasn’t\xa0popular yet as a tourist destination; hence, as an example, I didn’t know much about existing logistics and''hotels''because they didn’t exist as much before!

Ask any tourist who has been to our''group of islands''and they will surely speak volumes of its utter beauty and serenity —''however'', that doesn’t stop there because Batanes food or Ivatan cuisine is something to rave about too!''We are surrounded by clear seas and lush greenery after all, so you will definitely find a varied selection of seafood and vegetable dishes. They may all be cooked in a way that is simple, but I guarantee you, they are all flavorsome.''The best part of it all…?''You’ll be assured that every plate will be fresh and organic!''So in order to make the most of your''Batanes itinerary'', let me give you an idea of the top Ivatan food or dishes to try, as well as where to best try them.''» READ:''Batanes Itinerary for 5 Days''.''Batanes Food: What to Eat''TRIVIA'': When in the islands, you will notice that most of the Batanes food or dishes are served in a big green leaf (as shown on the cover photo of this post). This becomes even more evident if you come visit during a''fiesta''event.''Those leaves are called''vunung''or breadfruit leaves (or''kabaya''in Filipino). Traditionally, meals are served in this leaf for easy wrapping — not to mention that it’s environmentally-friendly too! As for utensils, we customarily use our hands. It may seem difficult at first, but as a local, this is like the best and most''homey''way to eat Batanes food. (In fact, science even shows that eating food with your hands is healthy! Google that to know what I mean *wink*)''#1''Uved''Called as ‘''tabtab''‘ in Sabtang (one of the 3 inhabited islands in Batanes),''uved''or''uvud''is one of those Ivatan comfort food that I always miss!''It’s basically\xa0made of finely-grated corm (which is found at the base of a trunk of a banana plant) that’s mixed with ground meat (beef or pork), and minced fish. Afterwards, it is seasoned with onion, garlic, salt and pepper. This will be rolled into balls or served as is and can either be with or without its broth.''.''#2''Dibang''A common fish that you will find in the islands is''dibang''or flying fish — yes, it does ‘fly’ or leap out of the water, a defense mechanism to evade predators.\xa0To date, it has different variations (other than simply frying it as is), such as:''Lataven''– are you familiar with''kinilaw''-style of preparing fish meat in the Philippines or simply, ‘ceviche’? If yes, then''lataven''is very similar to this.''Dibang''(or any kind of fish) is drenched\xa0in vinegar and calamansi juice, as well as\xa0mixed with minced ginger, onions, and salt.''Maytahes''(one-day-old) – after the fish is cleaned and opened up, it will be marinated in salt, vinegar, and garlic and then laid out under the sun for a day to dry.''.''#3''Vunes''This is a dish that my father used to prepare a lot for our family (he cooks it real good!). This is made of \xa0preserved''gabi''(taro) stalks which could technically last for years.''As a typical Batanes food, the''gabi''stalks are\xa0first soaked in water. Afterwards, it will be cut and minced and then cooked together with pork and''patola''(or sponge gourd).''You could surely think of it as another version of''laing'', a Bicol specialty in the Philippines.''.''#4''Payi''Payi''or lobsters are abundant in Batanes, so a humongous one can be easily bought for as cheap as Php 150 (or $3)! Indeed you could imagine my surprise when my family and I moved out of Batanes and I found out that my favorite''payi''is ridiculously expensive in the city.''As for another crustacean that you’ve probably heard about would be''tatus''or coconut crabs which are well known for its sweet meat and creamy''aligue''(or crab fat) — after all, they feed on\xa0fleshy fruits, nuts, seeds, and coconuts (which is not a big part of their diet, contrary to popular belief). Anyhow, these coconut crabs are impressive because they can climb a coconut tree, take one, and cut its husk with just their claws; although… it can actually take several days for the coconut to be opened.''Now here’s the thing:\xa0tatus''is declared as an endangered species.''If you search Google, there’s actually no official statement that they are endangered; but in Batanes, it has been declared as so because it’s noticeable how it has become considerably difficult to find or hunt for them. I do remember that when I was small, my father can catch coconut crabs easily if he just goes to the forest and fields, but it seems that nowadays, such is not the case anymore.''Starting this year, consuming them is NO longer allowed.''And in the rare case that you happen to stumble into a restaurant that offers you one, please refrain from eating it to help alleviate this problem. I mean I know that I’m kind of a tease for even discussing''tatus''when it’s actually a banned dish, but I feel the need to mention this so as to help educate you guys about the situation revolving this ‘endangered’ species in Batanes. Thanks for cooperating with us Ivatans!''.''#5''Root Crops''The Batanes Islands are abundant with root crops, namely:''Wakay''(sweet potato)''Dukay''(yam)''Uvi''(another type of yam)''Sudi''(taro)''They’re steamed, fried, or smoked; but recently, we have started to make different ways of cooking it (I’ve heard that there’s even a''wakay''donut now).''Personally, I love to eat them fried and then dipped in condensed milk or coconut cream!''.''#6''Luñis''This is a different version of the popular Filipino dish,''adobo'',''because''luñis''is rather served dry.''Lasting for quite a while, this traditional dish is made of pork cooked with rock salt until its fat is rendered and it turns golden brown. Back in the old days, it is stored in its own lard in jars for months to ensure continuous supply.''To best eat''luñis'', I love to pair it with''supas''whilst dipping it in vinegar and garlic!''.''#7''Supas''Always a staple during fiestas or festivals,''supas''or''balencyana''(as called in Itbayat Island) is rice cooked in turmeric pulp (yellow ginger) that’s often mixed with garlic and pork.''It’s aptly called as yellow rice because, well… it''is''yellow from the turmeric. Some people would often say that the taste is close to ‘''java rice''‘, and that’s right! Though, I have to say that I like our''supas''more when it comes to flavor.''.''#8''Other Local Vegetables''Tamiduk''– also called as''pako''or\xa0Fiddlehead fern, this is arguably the most popular vegetable in Batanes and one of my favorites too! When I was still living in the island, I often helped prepare it for our meals as it was easy to make: simply sauté and season with salt, garlic and onions. If you go to restaurants, they serve it as a salad with dressing (such as calamansi vinaigrette).''Utut nu Bulyas''– my favorite morning fix, these are scallions or green onions that are sautéed together with scrambled egg and spices.''Chinavules''– these are steamed taro leaves that are mixed with garlic, ginger, and onions.''.''#9''Other Batanes Food from the Sea''Arayu –''also called as''mahi-mahi''or golden dorado, this fish is indeed of golden color and slightly mixed with hues of blue and green. In Batanes, harvesting this fish is a part of a sacred tradition''(kapayvanuvanua)''in the small fishing village of''Diura.''Up to this day, the Ivatans there still practice it as they believe that it will protect them from the sea as well as give them a bountiful catch.''Kanañis''– octopus that is commonly fried, this is often a favorite when it comes to beer drinking sessions!''Seaweed soup or balls – my family actually rarely eat this but it’s quite a unique treat (and healthy too!)''Uni''– these are sea urchins and they can be eaten raw or cooked.''Dumay''– also called as a''‘common periwinkle’'',\xa0dumay''is a species of small edible sea snail; however, as much as I love them, it’s a bit of a pain to eat (you have to use a pin to scoop it out, but I bet restaurants can serve this to you without its shell).''.''There is absolutely a LOT of other Batanes food that you should try, but for now, these are the top dishes that I would recommend that you try as a start! Now, if you’re wondering about a must-try fruit or drink, below are what I would recommend (other than the typical mangoes, coconuts, etc.):''Chayi''–''or Spanish lime\xa0is not actually lime but more of a variant of a lychee. It can get messy to open it up though since its skin’s juice can be quite sticky, but the creamy pulp inside is so heavenly to eat!''Palek''–''our native wine that’s made from sugarcane and these are sold wildly across the islands.''.''Japan is one of the world’s top travel destinations, and\xa0it’s no news that a lot of\xa0tourists typically\xa0focus on the''“usuals”'', namely''Tokyo'', Kyoto and Osaka. Of course, these are amazing places\xa0that are worth anyone’s time,''BUT''if you want to go\xa0off the beaten path in order to\xa0explore a new prefecture that can easily\xa0take your breath away, hop\xa0on a''shinkansen''(bullet train) in Tokyo and head off to''Niigata''— the land of sake, snow, rice, gold, and adventure… which\xa0just so\xa0happens to be a short\xa02-hour ride away!''Niigata is found in Chubu / Central Japan region which is a haven of amazing activities. For other things to do in this area, see this:''Things to Do in Central Japan.''After all,\xa0Niigata is famous among the Japanese as one of the country’s top culinary and getaway hotspots, so\xa0I\xa0hope that a lot of travelers would come to discover this fact (much like how I discovered it for myself).''I visited\xa0this stunning\xa0place last year with the help of\xa0Niigata’s Tourism Board\xa0and they\xa0crafted up an itinerary that made me see the beauty of the prefecture in its entirety, albeit the small amount of time that I had.''To sum up my trip:''it was phenomenal.''Niigata''absolutely''surprised me with the\xa0vast\xa0array of\xa0fun activities that it\xa0had:\xa0foodie explorations, cultural immersions, sightseeing,\xa0gold picking (YES you can get some gold dust for yourself), and so much MORE!''Wondering what''Niigata Prefecture food''or drinks that you must absolutely try?''Check out this blog post to find out:''Niigata Prefecture: A New Japan Foodie Destination!''.''Without further ado, let me show you my 4-day Niigata itinerary which you could either copy or alter depending on your travel preference and travel dates.''.''4 Days Itinerary in Niigata''»''PRE-TRAVEL GUIDE''Where to get the best flight deals to get to Niigata city''?''My go-to platforms for grabbing the best flight deals are''Momondo''and''Skyscanner''. But of course, it’s always good practice to first research the budget airlines that exist in the country that you’re currently staying in because they could have rock-bottom prices that are not often visible in the above flight search engines.''The main airport in the capital of Niigata is''Niigata Airport''which primarily has flights from South Korea, China, and Guam.\xa0If you’re already located in Japan, there are domestic flights from Osaka, Sapporo, Nagoya, Fukuoka, and Sado.\xa0Once you’re at\xa0Niigata Airport, there is a shuttle bus that stops at JR Niigata South Exit station (cost of ¥400 one way).''Other options for getting in to Niigata:''By train.''There are several trains that go\xa0to Niigata, but your best bet especially when coming from Tokyo is to take the\xa0“''Toki''”\xa0or\xa0“''Max Toki''”''shinkansen''(bullet train) on JR East’s Joetsu Shinkansen line.\xa0It takes just about 2 hours and costs about ¥10,500 one-way ($90~ or Php\xa04,500~). It’s best to purchase a JR East pass or a''Japan Rail pass''for this if you’re staying in Japan for a long time and planning to jump from one place to another because these passes\xa0offer unlimited FREE\xa0travel on JR train lines upon purchase. Anyhow, your train costs can go lower if you\xa0take the Moonlight Echigo from Shinjuku (but it takes 6 hours: leaves at night and arrives in Niigata early morning) for ¥5,900 each way. This can go lower for ¥2,000\xa0during\xa0Seishun 18 promo season which is usually around March 1 – April 10, July 20 – September 20, and December 10 to January 10.''By bus.''Look out for''“Niigata Kotsu”.''You can ride this from Tokyo (5.5 hours, ¥5,250 one way), Nagoya (7.5 hours, ¥7,800 one way), or Sendai (3.8 hours, ¥4,500 one way).

Other than innate creativity and talent, what usually helps them to frame their shots so well is the research process that they do\xa0beforehand.''This means that it''really''helps for you to read through articles and guides both offline and online in order to know the best spots, attractions, as well as interesting architectures and landscapes that you can shoot during the duration of your stay.''It also helps to know the weather, the local culture, and all the other basic stuff that is unique to your destination. For example, if you check\xa0the weather in advance,\xa0you will then know the \xa0best days or times to shoot (which could be helpful\xa0for sunrise or sunset shots). And when it comes to\xa0culture, it’s beneficial\xa0to know the specifics\xa0because you can then learn any existing\xa0restrictions\xa0when it comes to taking photos on certain locations, or even the sensitivities to\xa0wearing certain clothing to some places etc.''TIP'':\xa0Most of the time, shooting during''golden hours or magic hours''is\xa0best. This is the\xa0period shortly after sunrise or before sunset in which the light\xa0is redder and softer compared to when the sun\xa0is higher in the sky.''One other thing you can do for research is to derive inspiration and ideas from existing photos!\xa0So head on to Google, Pinterest, or Instagram to see what people usually do when it comes to shooting landscapes, cityscapes, portraits, poses, and more.''Try to also refrain from having just one position or style to your photos — experiment and think out of the box. Get photos not only of yourself but of locals, busy streets, small alleyways… the list can go on and on.''.''2''Take note of\xa0the full functionalities of your smartphone camera, and then ‘prep’.''With today’s constant tech\xa0developments, some smartphone cameras\xa0have special features that are unique to their brand or series.\xa0That being said, you must ensure to read about all the capabilities that your smartphone has in order to make the most out of it!''For example, iPhone 7 Plus has a special\xa0‘portrait mode’ which gives off a really good macro or bokeh depth effect that is akin to the effect that DSLR prime lenses can give. Huawei phones have Leica-brand cameras that give off an interesting vibe on its shots.''Therefore, make the effort to learn how to take panoramas as a start, and if your iPhone or Android has a manual mode, play through with it in advance\xa0in order to see how its HDR, focus, shutter, etc. can be tweaked properly.''As for when I said\xa0‘prep’, I am actually referring to things like battery life, space, and connectivity. It’s no news that with constant use, smartphone batteries can die very quickly;\xa0that’s why you should\xa0make sure that you have a''power bank''on hand. For storage space, check that you\xa0have enough capacity or that you have learned the proper way of\xa0transferring your photos to your laptop or hard drive in order to free up some space from time to time.''Meanwhile, if\xa0you’re more of a person who wants to upload photos or do Instagram stories or snaps in''real time'', make sure that you get a''pocket wifi''beforehand too! (''TIP'':''Use code “''IAMAILEEN''” to save 15% off when renting a''Tep Wireless pocket wifi''.)''.''3''Make full use of awesome\xa0smartphone accessories.''Your smartphone is clearly\xa0a ‘shooting powerhouse’ in itself, but with the right accessories, it can go beyond its capabilities in order to\xa0make your shooting process better and faster.''At the moment, I am absolutely IN LOVE with the following items from''Pixter'':''Flexible Tripod'':''As you might already know, owning a tripod is useful for\xa0doing night shots and\xa0timelapses among many other things. Hence, owning a tripod for your phone will help you on your travel photography\xa0— but unlike typical tripods,\xa0this\xa0Flexible Tripod can ‘attach’, ‘grip’, or ‘wrap’ to any support or surface! So if you’re out in the woods with no\xa0surface that’s on eye level, you can just wrap this Flexible Tripod around a nearby tree and you’re good to shoot.''NOTE:''Compatible\xa0with all smartphone sizes.''.''Bluetooth Remote Control'':''With this little thing, you\xa0can finally take photos and videos WITHOUT touching your phone.\xa0So if\xa0you’re someone who does''Instagram or Snapchat stories'', you wouldn’t need another person’s help for pushing\xa0the buttons on boomerangs, photos, or videos because this remote can do it ALL\xa0for you!\xa0Without a doubt, this is\xa0a valuable\xa0contraption for group and solo shots. Aaah… I am just so crazy about this\xa0as a solo traveler because it can save me so much time''(I no longer need to run\xa0back and forth to my camera just to set the timer again, and again — and again!).''Of course, coming\xa0up to people and asking them to take my photo is an option but it’s often a hassle; it’s not like every person out there can also frame the shot the way that I want it and I’d also be shy to ask for too many retakes.''NOTE:''Works for all smartphones that have Bluetooth connectivity. Trigger is functional within 15 meters.''.''Wide Angle Pro Lens'':\xa0When it comes to travel, I typically use a wide lens on my DSLR (since it’s perfect for taking landscapes and restricted indoor shots [such as hotel rooms, etc.] for my blogging work) so this nifty clip-on wide angle lens for my iPhone\xa0is such a helpful accessory!\xa0Not only does it have advanced optical design with no significant distortion, but it is also made of high quality materials for great and\xa0smooth clamping on\xa0your smartphone. Now, that doesn’t stop there because they have other available lenses too for your fancy:''fisheye, super fisheye, polarizer, telephoto, and macro!''NOTE:''Works for all smartphones, both for back and front cameras.''COMPARISON: With and Without Wide Angle Lens''The best part? You can get these 3 items in one great''Travel Pack''that costs only\xa0$69.90!''BONUS'': This is a post about taking better travel photos; but how about travel videos? Your smartphone can already be a decent video taker! However, I do know that they don’t have the most optimal image stabilization features. To fix this, a''gimbal''is important! For suchh, I would recommend DJI’s Osmo Mobile which will make your video stable and your clips cinematic. To see my detailed review on this, see''here''.''.''4''Rome was one of my stops\xa0during my trip to Europe early this year, and for such a magnificent place, I wanted an equally magnificent stay wherein I can bask in all of the glory that this ancient city holds!

By the turn of the 18th century, it was rebuilt and owned by the noble Guidi family as part of the area''“Giardino Guidi”,''and by 2002 it was purchased by Count Goffredo Manfredi (on of Italy’s most famous magnates) who ushered the start of today’s\xa0luxurious Palazzo Manfredi.''Grand Neighbours.''Like I’ve already mentioned, this\xa0boutique hotel is just a few meters away from the highlights of ancient Rome so you can witness history unfold before your very eyes: from\xa0the nearby ruins of''Ludus Magnus''(the largest gladiatorial school), the''Colosseum'', the''Roman Forum,''the''Palatine Hill''and more!''A Lux Gem.''Right from the lobby, to your room, and up to the terrace, Palazzo Manfredi does not skimp on lush elements to provide you the most luxurious items and materials in its interiors.

Depending on your interests or the amount of time that you want to spend in specific places, you can visit a certain spot on the itinerary for a shorter OR longer time. But to give you an idea of the''standard itinerary''that they have, the 2-day tour typically goes like the below…''– DAY 1 –''Walk over to the''Palatine Hill''(that has great panoramic views overlooking the Colosseum, the Circus Maximus, and the Roman Forum)''Walk through the ruins of the''Roman Forum''(see the Senate, the great temples, arches, and more of the places where people like Augustus and Julius Caesar made history)''Short break near\xa0the historic''Capitoline Hill'', one of the''Seven Hills''of Rome''Explore the vast amphitheatre that is of the''Colosseum''and learn of all its spectacles and gladiator history''Lunch near the Colosseum (recommended:''Ristorante Naumachia'')''Explore piazzas and famous fountains like''Trevi Fountain'',''Spanish Steps,\xa0Piazza Sant’Eustachio, Piazza Navona, Piazza Farnese,''and''Campo de’ Fiori.''Drop by''Venchi''for gelato or chocolates and witness their massive ‘chocolate waterfall’ — yep, you read that right!''See the stunning''Pantheon''and''Hadrian’s Temple''.''.''– DAY 2\xa0–''Witness the imposing fortress of''Castel Sant’Angelo''(it has great panoramic views on top overlooking the Rome cityscape, especially that of the river and the Vatican).''Skip the long line and visit the''Vatican Museums''which boasts one of the greatest collections of art in the world (see the well-known galleries and beauties:''Sistine Chapel, Raphael Rooms,''etc.)''Lunch at a traditional Italian restaurant (your guide will suggest several places for you to choose from)''Continue onward to''St. Peter’s Basilica''and''St. Peter’s Square.''If there’s still free time, explore the cobbled pathways and charming trattorias in the lively neighbourhood of''Trastevere''.''.''– TIPS\xa0–''Wear comfortable shoes\xa0since this is primarily a walking tour and there are areas in Rome with steps and uneven walkways.''When visiting the Vatican, there is a dress code wherein you’re required to keep your shoulders and knees covered. Large bags, backpacks, tripods and large umbrellas are not allowed inside the museums but these can be left at the museum coat check (which you can retrieve after visiting the basilica).''Large bags and items cannot be brought into the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill. There is no coat check so there’s no place where you can leave your items. There are also security checks so it’s best to not bring any alcoholic beverages, glass bottles and spray canisters (example: sun cream etc.)''Be prepared in case the Basilica of St. Peter’s gets closed due to unscheduled closing and late openings due to religious ceremonies.

So yes, I will definitely come back (and probably try a different Through Eternity kind of tour)!''.''PRE-TRAVEL GUIDE''Where to get the best flight deals to Rome?''My go-to platforms for grabbing the best flight deals are''Momondo'',''Kayak'', and''Skyscanner''. But of course, it’s always good practice to research first the budget airlines that exist in the country that you’re currently staying in, since they could have rock-bottom prices that are not often visible in the above flight search engines.''There are 2 main airports in Rome:''Leonardo da Vinci/Fiumicino International Airport''and''G.B.

Now, they’re quite expensive but if you’re on a rush, cost starts at €3 and can go up to €27 in an hour. Flagging them down is possible but they prefer to take passengers via the taxi stands or by calling them up for booking.''By foot''.\xa0Everything at the center can be explored by foot.''By public transportation.''All of Rome’s public transportation network use the same kind of tickets so you can buy passes like Roma 24H (€7), Roma 48H (€12.50), and Roma 72H (€18).

So when the newest hit craze spot,''Inflatable Island'', messaged me and asked if I wanted to visit them (on dates in which I was timely free) to\xa0try their beach AND water playground, it was as if they knew that I was slacking off!''Hence, it\xa0was easy to say YES after that invitation, especially because it\xa0would also be my\xa0first time\xa0in trying such a thing.

(Frequently Asked Questions)''◘◘''How can I get to Inflatable Island?''See my ‘Pre-Travel Guide’ below.''◘◘''Can kids come and play?''Sure thing! But take note that there’s a height requirement in order to play at the Inflatable Island and it’s 3 feet. Also, for younger kids, they require a 1:1 adult kid ratio to ensure the safety of the young ones.''◘◘''Can\xa0I bring my own food and drinks?''Unfortunately, you can’t. But don’t fret, they have stalls at Bali Lounge where you can buy food and drinks. (For Samba Beach area, they have a corkage fee that starts at Php 500 for 1-7 pax).''◘◘''How deep is the water? What if I can’t swim?''It’s about 4 to 15 feet, that’s why once you go to the inflatables, it’s a requirement for everyone to wear life vests, no matter if you’re good at swimming. Rest assued, they have tons of life guards who are on duty at the inflatables.''◘◘''Can I use a selfie stick while I’m on the inflatables?''Yes, they allow action cameras, selfie sticks, and any kind of gadget. However, it’s your responsibility to waterproof it all and of course, it’s advisable to attach a floating device to your tech gear\xa0because the management would find it hard to retrieve sunken\xa0items. (Because of the material, sharp objects\xa0or anything that\xa0could damage the Inflatable Island\xa0is not allowed).''◘◘''Are there lockers for storing my stuff?''Yes!\xa0Rental fee for the big lockers is Php 100 (half day) and\xa0Php 150\xa0(whole day). As for the small lockers, it’s Php\xa050 (half day) and\xa0₱100 (whole day).''◘◘''Is there a first aid area?''Yes, it’s right beside the spot where you will claim your life jacket. As I’ve also previously mentioned, there are a lot of life guards on the inflatable area; after all, ensuring everybody’s safety is Inflatable Island’s priority (apart from ensuring everybody’s\xa0enjoyment -wink-).''◘◘''What should I wear once I’m on\xa0the Inflatable Island itself?''Swimsuits,\xa0board shorts, bikinis, speedos, etc. can be worn. But they\xa0do HIGHLY recommend the use of rash guards and/or swim leggings to prevent sun burns and rashes — besides, this is a slip and slide adventure! Additionally, make sure that you’re not wearing anything\xa0with buttons, zippers, or any sharp objects. This also includes earrings, watches or rings since it might damage the inflatables. Once you’re on shore, naturally, you may wear whatever you desire!''»''Bali Lounge''The fun doesn’t stop at the water\xa0in Inflatable Island because once you get a hold of their pass, it instantly grants you access to their Bali Lounge for a whole day.''So before and after you set foot\xa0on their inflatables, you can have your swell time hanging around at this lounge which has\xa0colorful umbrellas and bean bags (great for those Instagram-worthy photo ops too!). And when you get struck by thirst, you can order for some drinks and fruit\xa0shakes that are often served in cute cup floaters. For those who are looking for unique eats, make sure to try their''Roccoloco Bowls.''NOTE'': Since space is limited in the Bali Lounge, it’s a first-come-first-serve basis. No worries because there are extra ‘normal’ chairs and tables nearby.''»''Samba Beach''To add more to the number of ‘perks’ that you’ll receive by buying a pass for Inflatable Island, access to the adjacent Samba Beach is also FREE!''Rest assured, if in case you’re coming with a big crowd, you can book a cabana (or wooden open cottage) beforehand.

Though you might not be able to complete the whole course, I promise you, it can get a bit tiring so that time frame is just about right for all the water fun. Best time slot would be the 8AM or 4PM slot wherein the sun isn’t at its harshest.\xa0(If you pick the 4PM slot, you can arrive way before since the passes all grant a WHOLE DAY access to the Bali Lounge and Samba Beach — of course, it gives you access to the inflatables within your time slot only).''What hotel to stay in\xa0Subic''?''I would highly recommend any of the following:''Luxury:''Whiterock Waterpark and Beach Hotel'',''Kamana Sanctuary Resort and Spa''Mid-Range:''The Reef'',''Moonbay Marina Villas'',''Subic Bay Peninsular Hotel''Budget:''Sabina Beach Resort'',''Cherry Midtown Hotel''If you’re interested, Inflatable Island can package your stay and inflatable passes with\xa0their partner hotel,''Subic Bay Peninsular''.

Still and the same, these challenges surely added more flair to my trip and I was more than ready to start ticking them off!''Arrival, Noon:''While I was on the plane, I had to wonder why it seemed like all the seats were packed…\xa0I mean, I would expect this phenomena\xa0from such a famous place like Boracay for example; but for Masbate, I had to rack my brain and wonder why I hadn’t heard of this place if\xa0it had that\xa0much passengers per flight!''I got the answer to my question 1 hour later as I landed at Masbate’s airport and glimpsed at the posters and locals who were clad in cowboy-esque clothing:''Rodeo Festival.''This was the city’s biggest festival and I happened to have\xa0arrived during the height of it all (given that it was the start of the competitions and the official opening)!''To keep the record straight,\xa0this didn’t seem to be the intention\xa0of Cebu Pacific Air\xa0because I picked the dates for the trip (as per my availability).''As I felt the excitement in the air, I started to have a bad feeling about my trip. My worries were confirmed once I visited the city’s tourism office:''they told me that as much as they wanted to help me map out my itinerary, hotels were fully booked because of the festival. PLUS,\xa0all tours are also packed already with no available boats nor guides left!''Nevertheless, I wasn’t one to be disheartened. I had my worries but\xa0I knew I had to ‘soldier on’. And so, I hailed a tricycle and\xa0headed off to a nearby hotel to try my chances.''“''Sorry, we have no rooms left!”,''the receptionist told me apologetically.''The more budget accommodations were of course a no-go.\xa0But I still wasn’t going to give\xa0up! Before moving on to the next hotel, I stayed a\xa0bit\xa0at the\xa0lobby of\xa0Ross Hotel as I\xa0started asking the people there\xa0about other places that I can try.''It was in that\xa0moment when\xa0someone behind me quipped, “''They don’t have a\xa0room for you…?''”''I turned around and glanced upon a lady clad in a dress and a cowboy hat. I had a feeling that she was going to ‘save’ me — and she did!''To cut the story short, her name was Airis and she\xa0offered me a reserved\xa0room of her friend at Rendezvous Hotel\xa0who couldn’t make it to Masbate.\xa0Imagine what luck I had when it just so happened that she booked the room for 2 nights! She warned me\xa0that the hotel was old yet\xa0it was worth Php 1,300 per night because of\xa0the festival season; but I really didn’t mind. It was to be expected anyway, and I was already more than happy to have a place\xa0where I can sleep in later on in the night.''We continued to exchange info and numbers and while I was riding\xa0the tricycle to my hotel,\xa0I found out \xa0via texts from her that:''She was a Secretary to the''Sangguniang Panlalawigan''in Masbate.''She had already paid P1,000 deposit for my room, so I only had to pay Php 1,600.''I can correspond with\xa0the hotel owner and arrange a tour because he was a dear friend of hers.''Mind you, she didn’t know\xa0yet that I was a travel blogger,\xa0so she wasn’t definitely doing this for promotion nor appearances and whatnot: she was doing this simply out of her innate kindness.''Needless to say, my welcome in Masbate started\xa0off great!''Activities, Afternoon till Night:''Cookie, the hotel owner of\xa0Rendezvous\xa0Hotel, managed to arrange a boat for me on the next day to a\xa0nearby island called as Buntod Sandbar\xa0(which was also a reef sanctuary). He suggested that I just spend the rest of the day enjoying the festivities of the Rodeo festival and that’s exactly what I did!''I walked through the Masbate’s center\xa0feeling a bit out of place as well as a bit enthralled as I watched all the people around me in full cowboy and cowgirl regalia.''The Rodeo Festival in Masbate City is an annual event that happens in the month of April and it comprises a series of events and competitions that aim to showcase the work of ranch workers. This is to\xa0ultimately\xa0bring awareness to the cattle-raising industry in the province.''Growing up in''Batanes'', I am no stranger to\xa0how cattle are raised BUT this was the first time that I ever saw\xa0a rodeo show.\xa0As I sat at the bleachers of the Grand Rodeo Arena, I can’t help but feel sorry for the cows\xa0and I even started to be conflicted at why\xa0I was watching the whole show… After all, I really don’t want to support affairs that derive entertainment out of animals from actions that could hurt them.''However, I was assured that\xa0the whole affair was simply a showcase of typical animal-handling skills done by people in a ranch. The officials also continually\xa0ensure\xa0that no animals will get hurt or be injured from the events\xa0because they strive to maintain animal welfare and safety. At the very core, they simply want to promote Masbate as the home of Philippine Rodeo as well as the best source of organic beef.''With all that said and done,\xa0I leave it up to you to decide if you want to attend and watch this famous festivity in Masbate.''The show aside, it was surreal to walk around the arena’s shopping area as well as\xa0the rest of the city’s spaces because I truly felt as if\xa0I was transported to a western country (what with all the cowboys and cowgirls that were all over the place!).''Come night time, there was a stage set up with surrounding\xa0food stalls\xa0and it was here that I had my first local seafood dish whilst\xa0I watched a music concert and a fireworks show.''.''»''DAY #2''«''April 19, Whole Day:''I initially wanted to witness the ‘''cattle drive''‘ —\xa0an event that reenacts\xa0the practice of the Masbate ranchers whenever they bring herds and herds of cattle to the port in the olden days. However… I heard the time wrongly so unfortunately,\xa0I didn’t catch it on time.''Anyhow, since\xa0I was already at\xa0the center,\xa0I decided to stroll the streets and see more sights. One interesting landmark I found was the San Antonio de Padua Cathedral which had a beautiful altar and pulpit!''I eventually rode a tricycle back to the hotel after I had my fun walking through the center\xa0(so that I could make it in time for my boat ride to Buntod Sandbar).''First though: lunch! The locals at the hotel vehemently made me try one of their local dishes called as''“sinagol”''when I asked for their suggested dish. I asked the content and they told me that it was made of shark meat mixed with coconut cream and vegetables. I was certainly apprehensive at first… but after my first bite I really felt like asking for more!\xa0I guess you can never go wrong with dishes that have coconut mixed in.''After I had my fill, the staff at the hotel started to look\xa0for a group that I could join to\xa0Buntod and they ended up finding a troop\xa0who\xa0still had one slot left for their boat trip. After introductions were done with, I found out that my companions that day were\xa0all workmates who came all the way from Naga City for the Rodeo festival.''They were incredibly\xa0friendly\xa0and accommodating that by the end of the day, they did NOT\xa0allow me to pay for the boat nor for the snacks\xa0that they brought! I surely felt welcome and well taken care of. I guess they were fascinated about the fact that I was traveling alone, so they took it upon themselves to look after me somewhat.''Meanwhile, Buntod Sandbar was as picturesque as I thought it would be! According to the currents and the tide, its shape and size can change. Furthermore,\xa0the young mangrove plantation at one of it’s tip was seemingly a haven\xa0to some baby black tip sharks. I didn’t manage to witness one but they’re said to pass\xa0through the roots during high tide; rest assured, they’re creatures that you shouldn’t be scared of.''As a marine sanctuary, you\xa0can also snorkel to the nearby reefs but it helps to note that you need to\xa0watch out for sea urchins because\xa0they can be quite prevalent on those\xa0parts.''As\xa0the clock struck 6PM, we slowly made our way back to the main shore on our boat while\xa0we soaked in\xa0the great sunset views on the horizon. Before I bid goodbye to my companions, they swiftly extended a dinner invitation to me and it was easy to say ‘yes’. What followed for the rest of the night was a hearty dinner with newfound friends and a night of fun back to the rodeo arena!''.''»''DAY #3''«''April 20, Morning:''“You’re never really alone when you travel. The world is full of friends waiting to get to know you…”''I may have traveled to Masbate alone but NOT\xa0once did I feel that I was by myself.

Nope!)''I was ready to do a solo adventure to the fox village in Miyagi prefecture at that time; however, happiness is best experienced when shared, right? That’s why I invited my friend,''Kaila'', who was living in Tokyo at that time to come with me, and I’m so glad that I did because we had a swell time!''Come and read on below to see how our experience went! You can also watch the vlog / video recap I made below. Meanwhile,''at the bottom\xa0of this article'', you’ll see a detailed travel guide where I discuss about\xa0how to\xa0reach this fox village so that you (and your friends) could drown in cuteness as well. ♥︎''.''Fox Village''Miyagi Zao Fox Village or''Kitsune Mura''is an 18,000 square feet enclosed area in a large-scale forest found on\xa0the outskirts of\xa0Shiroishi city. There are about 200 free-roaming foxes here who were saved from slaughter for the fur trade\xa0and to date, there are 6 types of them:''the rare silver fox, arctic fox, Japanese red fox, cross fox, platinum fox, and platinum gold fox.''Obviously, this place is NOT\xa0a village. It’s rather an animal-sanctuary-''slash''-zoo where foxes are brought up to be taken care of\xa0the rest of their lives, and that in order to continue breeding, feeding, and protecting\xa0them, the owners\xa0open the ‘village’ to the public. That being said, visitors are free to\xa0roam inside\xa0and see them up close — however, touching the foxes is NOT\xa0allowed\xa0because they’re not totally tamed.''TRIVIA:''Foxes or ‘''kitsune''‘ are popular subjects in Japanese mythology and folklore\xa0as they’re commonly depicted as intelligent beings who possess magical abilities and who can even shape-shift into a human form.''Due to these stories, foxes and humans back in ancient\xa0Japan actually lived close together which later on increased their supernatural significance. For one thing, kitsune were closely associated to''Inari\xa0Okami'', a Shinto''kami''or spirit of wealth\xa0+\xa0prosperity +\xa0rice, as its messengers. That’s why up to this day, some people make offerings to them as a deity in shrines because of their potential ‘power’.''With all that said and done, you can be assured of the fact that the Japanese love and respect foxes.''»''Entrance Office''The front office has Japanese personnel, and as what you might expect, they don’t speak English well. However, they have prepared signs and demonstrations (with some parts translated into\xa0English) that will give you all the details that you need.''At this point, you have to pay the''entrance fee''of\xa0\u200e¥1,000 yen ($8~ or Php 40~) and you can also buy food for feeding the foxes later on (optional at\xa0\u200e¥100 yen or less than a dollar / Php 45~).''Some important things to remember:''Do''NOT''bring any other food inside the fox enclosure. If you buy one of the food packs for the foxes at the reception, you must keep it inside your bag. Take it out\xa0and use it to feed nearby foxes''only''when you’re in the feeding area.''NOTE'': The foxes are familiar with\xa0the food packs and to prevent them from snatching it away from you and from accidentally eating the plastic of the packaging, please hide\xa0it away from them.''.''Young children are allowed to go in, but it’s advisable to carry your kids\xa0when there are nearby roaming foxes.''.''Be careful of your belongings, especially the smaller things because they will easily mistake it for food. Once they catch something from you, you’ll most likely not get\xa0it back since they will quickly run away and bury it somewhere.''FACT'': Foxes LOVE digging holes and burying their food because at a young age, they were taught to store food in case of dire times. For sure the\xa0foxes here are fed everyday, but they still dig and bury food by instinct.''.''Do''NOT''pet nor touch the foxes inside the enclosure. They will bite. And when they’re sleeping, do NOT\xa0bother nor\xa0harass them either; let them be.''NOTE'': Foxes are mostly nocturnal, spending\xa0most of the day resting or sleeping.''.''»''OUTSIDE the Enclosed Area''I didn’t manage to take photos''(because I swiftly went inside the ‘village’) but before you enter the gates that lead you to the ‘fox village’ itself, there is an area just outside the reception where\xa0you will already see a few foxes — however, they\xa0are either in cages or in a collar leash. This will make you sad or it might even enrage you; but apparently, these foxes were mostly juvenile ones that needed to be treated and separated from the rest in order to hasten their healing process (others were being vaccinated since the sanctuary makes it a point to keep away any diseases). The staff\xa0usually keeps them in for a while until they’re okay to go out to the open field with the others.''You will also see there some younger foxes in cages\xa0and they’re mostly being kept there for proper rearing before they’re free to roam the main enclosure area with the rest of the other mature foxes. This is because newborn foxes are unable to see, hear or walk; so they need proper care during that age. To note, it’s here that visitors are free to carry and pose with these younger foxes for\xa0\u200e¥400 yen for a few minutes. You will just be required to wear a jacket\xa0that they provide (for protection) before holding the fox.''It seems that they only give out the younger ones this petting opportunity because\xa0they’re not as finicky with the human touch given their young age. (After all, it was mentioned in their blog that petting and photo opportunities will be unavailable if there are no newborn fox cubs. Still and the same, I don’t recommend that you do it.)''Other than foxes, you can also pet other animals here such as rabbits, ponies, and goats. But then again, I didn’t really come there to pet these animals nor the foxes — I just want to be surrounded by TONS of\xa0these cute little fellas\xa0up close!''And so, off I went\xa0to the main fox village’s enclosed area…''»''INSIDE the Enclosed Area''It was autumn season when I visited, so once I stepped into the 18,000 feet forest, you can just\xa0imagine how surreal it was to suddenly see several\xa0red foxes in this scarlet landscape, looking towards my direction!''As I started to walk, I noticed a trait that was common to all of these cute foxes too:''if I stand still, their inane curiosity will take over and they will willingly come up to me!''HOWEVER, the moment that I moved an inch or started walking, they immediately\xa0scamper away.''NOTE: I’m wearing fake fur. I just happened to be wearing this when we went to visit. 😅''Just be mindful though when you sit down because they might start biting your clothes or even your butt.''Which brings us back to the idea that though these foxes are a lot tamer than wild foxes, they’re still technically ‘wild’ and brought up in a way that’s almost akin to a life as if they are ‘outside’.''When the paved road ended, I started to climb up the hill to explore the rest of the fox village. Up there, I saw a lot more\xa0foxes who were either sleeping or walking around (probably looking for food).''I then proceeded to take\xa0my sweet time in making stops and picturing these fluffy creatures!''Somewhere at the top, in the middle of the forest, you would find\xa0the feeding station which is\xa0a wooden structure raised on stilts. It’s easy to spot given the signs AND the number of foxes who are eagerly waiting for food to be thrown at them from this platform.''‘Throw’,''because the fox village does NOT allow you to feed the foxes by hand. (It’s hard anyway to feed them by hand if you’re at this high-rise feeding station — but still, it helps that you’re reminded of this).''Also, when you walk in to this feeding station, make sure that you close the door behind you and that you don’t let any of the foxes in. Once inside, do ready\xa0your fox treats as you\xa0prepare to have your\xa0heart melted\xa0by several adorable furry eyes below!''NOTE:''As with any animal, some of these foxes will fight for the food that you throw so I suggest that you throw\xa0the treats at isolated foxes to avoid any scuffle amongst them.''If you go further out, you will\xa0see\xa0a shrine with''kitsune''statues and a''torii''gate that’s common for Shinto shrines.''As I spent more time inside, I\xa0finally got the chance to hear how a''fox’s “bark”''sounds like — and heck… this was the only thing that\xa0was NOT cute about them. Their voice certainly\xa0sounded like a blood-curdling scream that can only be the stuff of nightmares! (''If you want to hear ‘what does the fox say’, just watch the''YouTube video''I have above''.)''Their barking aside, foxes still remain to be delightful and captivating in my books, and I’m so glad that a place like this exists!\xa0At the end of this experience, I realized that\xa0they just might well be my spirit animal —''they sleep a lot, eat a lot, are mischievous, and have a scream that can rage hell on Earth if annoyed. *wink*''NOTE:''Once you come back, there is a small souvenir / gift shop behind the reception. Rest assured, if you see products with fur, they’re made from fake fur (like plushies etc.), except for a few key chains that you will find there which are made from real fox fur — HOWEVER, those are all from Norway and Denmark (…a bit ironic, yeah; I hope they stop selling that). Nevertheless, the Fox Village says that they never breed their foxes for fur.''»''Aspect of Ethics''I have seen a\xa0couple of\xa0mixed reactions about the Miyagi Zao Fox Village and I totally understand the concern.\xa0First of all, much like a zoo, there’s no denying that this establishment profits from these animals; however, I personally have no qualms about that kind of\xa0set-up\xa0for as long as they properly take care of the foxes — which they seemingly do here! Seeing them all up close, the fox village’s “residents”\xa0looked active, happy, healthy, and well taken care of to me. Also,\xa0the strict rules that the sanctuary implements about not touching these animals was a plus for me, as well as the fact that the original foxes that were taken in here were saved from slaughter from fur trade (according to the establishment’s caretakers).''NOTE:''Foxes typically shed their fur at the beginning of spring and have shorter fur (or look less fluffier) by summer, making them look ‘patchy’. Come autumn and winter, the foxes will start to grow more fur to protect themselves from the cold.''I’ve read reviews online who have commented on their patchy furs, saying that they looked unhealthy because of that — but I think they didn’t know this natural process of fur shedding by foxes that’s why it led them to think as such.''Secondly, I wholly agree with the concept of leaving animals to the wild. However, given today’s times, most of them might\xa0need some sort of protection. Looking at the facts, a fox in the wild has an average life span of 2-4 years only because of hunting practices and road accidents.''(You cannot imagine the number of people who would ‘kill’ for fox fur, nor the number of people who do fox hunting for fun/sport\xa0like the UK for example).''In Miyagi Zao Fox village, their foxes can live up to 14 years old! I definitely see that as added\xa0proof that they’re fine being here. Now, some might suggest releasing them into the wild after a certain age too, but I think that’s not a good idea because given their upbringing, they might not survive out there anymore and their chances of survival will become slimmer. Not to mention that they’re more susceptible to diseases in the wild.''If it helps to note, foxes are also one of the few animals who don’t suffer any type of stress when under captivity''— a lot of researchers are looking into this trait that they have so that they could possibly find out how they can alleviate stress for other animals in captivity.''Nevertheless, even if they’re raised in-house, they’re still brought up in a way\xa0that aims to preserve their\xa0natural characteristics. (For example, they let the foxes do their infamous cub separation process which you can learn more about on the fox village’s website''here''.)''All in all, if you hate zoo environments or any sort of animal enclosure no matter if the conditions are well and good, I suggest that you don’t visit this place or it will make you uncomfortable. As for me, I just try to keep an open mind and I don’t immediately shun every\xa0animal park, especially if the animals are well-cared for. That being said, I remain\xa0to recommend this place to you guys!''Though of course, I do admit that there can be certain improvements that can be made here — such as better cages, better processes, more English materials to explain how they function, etc. so much like me, do feel free to talk or send an email to the staff (if you can’t speak Japanese) about your comments since they’re very open to hearing what their visitors think.''.''How to Reach the Fox Village''I highly suggest that you do\xa0this as a day trip while you’re visiting Tokyo since it’s only a few hours away by train!''ADDRESS:''Kawarago-11-3 Fukuokayatsumiya, Shiroishi, Miyagi Prefecture 989-0733''TELEPHONE:''0224-24-8812''WEBSITE:''www.zao-fox-village.com''EMAIL:''[email\xa0protected]''HOURS OF OPERATION:''9:00AM to 16:00PM''ADMISSION FEE:''¥1,000 yen ($8~ or Php 40~) for adults.

(For example, you can get the Tohoku Shinkansen at Tokyo Station or Ueno Station and it takes less than 2 hours to get to Shiroishi-Zao).''With''JR Pass'': you don’t need to pay. Just present your pass at the station.''Without JR Pass: ticket costs around ¥9,000 yen one way only ($80~ or Php 4,000~).''*If you don’t have a JR Pass and find the train tickets to be too costly, you can take a\xa0highway bus from Tokyo to Sendai that costs about\xa0¥3,000 to\xa0¥5,000 yen. However, take note that this takes about 6 hours. Once you reach Sendai, you need to catch a regular train to Shiroishi-Zao Station (costs about\xa0¥750 yen).''Once you’re at Shiroishi-Zao,''there are several options you can choose from to reach the fox village:''By taxi:\xa0There are taxis lined up outside the station. In case you don’t see any, feel free to ask the JR office in the station to call a taxi for you. It cost us ¥3,900 one way to the fox village (for about 20 minutes). The taxi driver will hand you a paper like the one below which you should present to the reception at fox village once you need to go back to the train station (so that he will come back to pick you up, in which the cost will remain the same; so it’s best that you come with others so you can split the cost).''By bus: There is a line called''Castle-kun''that runs on Tuesdays and Fridays and\xa0goes to Kawarago Damn from the station around 8AM and 4PM. The fox village is not a regular stop though, so you have to let the driver know. Make sure that you confirm the time that it returns as well. (Cost: ¥200 yen one way).''If you’ve been to Tokyo before, I bet you’ve seen a drumming game in the arcades of Akihabara\xa0that\xa0the Japanese seemingly''love''to play. It’s\xa0called as''Taiko no Tatsujin''.''Back when I revisited Japan, the Niigata Tourism Board asked me if I wanted to\xa0learn more about\xa0“''taiko''“''.''Upon mention of that word, I remembered the drums that I saw in the arcades, and I also mentioned a\xa0PlayStation game that I used to play called ‘''Patapon''‘, which seemed to have been\xa0inspired out of taiko playing too. They said that if I found those fascinating, I would be more fascinated by the real thing\xa0— of course!''From what I’ve learned, taiko is a traditional Japanese percussion instrument\xa0that has\xa0deep roots in ancient Japanese mythology.\xa0It has been used in warfare to motivate troops, send out orders, and set a marching pace''(apart from it being used in theatre, festivals, and rituals).''Nowadays however, ‘taiko’ is more often used as a term to refer to the drumming performance itself — commonly to a style called''kumi-daiko''(ensemble-style playing). It’s said that there are over 5,000 taiko groups active in Japan and the''Kodo''performing arts ensemble, who hails\xa0from''Sado Island'', is one of the most popular taiko groups not only in the country\xa0but worldwide too.''So when they asked me if I wanted to sail to Sado Island to try taiko drumming with one of the former members of Kodo, it was\xa0a sure''‘yes’''from me!''» READ'':''4-Day Itinerary in Niigata, Japan''If you’re more of a visual person, you can already watch my vlog / video below covering my taiko experience at Sado Island:''.''Sado Island Taiko Centre''(Tatakokan)''Run by Kodo Cultural Foundation, the Sado Island Taiko Centre (also called as''Tatakokan'') is nestled on top of a hill beside the neighbourhood of Kodo village,\xa0beautifully\xa0overlooking Mano Bay and\xa0the Osado mountain range. It\xa0has been built from local Sado Island timber and features a\xa0spacious\xa0hall, a traditional cooking classroom, an exhibition room, and several meeting rooms available for rent.''All throughout the year, a range of events and ‘Taiko Experience’ programs are being offered here\xa0that make use of decades of experience and know-how by the famous group of Kodo. One of those programs include hands-on experiences from Kodo instructors who\xa0teach beginners on how\xa0to play the taiko.''Fortunately, I had the pleasure to meet and be taught by a 10-year veteran member of Kodo,''Shinichi Sogo''— or “''Shin-chan sensei''“, an honorific which he wanted to be called — and he was an amazing person who was bubbling with energy and warmth!''Shin-chan sensei\xa0didn’t seem to speak English but my accompanying translator (''Yasushi-san'')\xa0told me\xa0that he has been with Kodo since 1981 and has since participated in over 1,000 performances in 30 countries worldwide. After he stopped performing, he became a staff member for a while; but since 2007, he decided to serve as an instructor in\xa0the Sado Island Taiko Centre.''But before I go on… let me just ask you:''how old do you think he is?''Well I thought he was in his 40s; but apparently, he was about to reach 60!!!\xa0I complimented him on how young he looked and he said that taiko players almost always look younger than they do — or that it could also be the genes. We both laughed, but\xa0I guess it has some truth to it\xa0because\xa0I can imagine the kind of exercise and training that taiko players\xa0have to do to play and perform with these drums.''I proceeded to survey\xa0the hall\xa0and saw all the taiko drums that were set up\xa0around us.\xa0I gladly quipped, “''So how many\xa0other people will be joining us today?''”''He beamed, “''No one. It’s just you. I’m going to be teaching you privately today!''”''AWESOME.''.''Taiko Drumming Experience''Shin-chan sensei led me to the front of the hall and gestured towards 2 huge one-of-a-kind taiko drums that were called as''odaiko''—\xa0which literally means “big fat drum”. These were apparently hand-carved by Kodo members from an enormous 600-year-old''keyaki''(Japanese zelkova tree).''They called the biggest\xa0odaiko, which somewhat looks\xa0like a potato, as ‘''Yamaimo-kun''‘.\xa0Whereas the other one which was laid down with only a cover on one side was called as''‘Butabana-chan’,''mainly because it has a part on the side that looks like a pig’s snout.''After pulling out some''bachi''(thick drum sticks), Shin-chan sensei hit the\xa0bigger\xa0odaiko for a couple of times… and''that''was the first time that I heard the sound of a taiko up close, and it sent out such a deep echo\xa0that reverberated across the wooden halls.''I instantly felt goosebumps!''More so when Shin-chan sensei\xa0played a powerful odaiko solo for me (''which you can see in the video above at 00:01'')''Suffice to say, I was floored. I can just imagine a spectacular group of taiko players performing for the upcoming 2020 Japan Olympics and that would be SO\xa0amazing! After all, from what I’ve already witnessed, taiko drumming has a unique and dynamic playing style.''It is\xa0fast, it is\xa0loud, and it is\xa0intense!''In fact, if you were to watch a group performance (such as that of the video below by Kodo) you might agree with me when I say that taiko\xa0performances are like 50% music and 50% dance / choreographed movements that are akin to Japanese martial arts!''Shin-chan sensei handed me some\xa0bachi and he urged me to try to beat the two odaiko separately for as much as I could… boy — was it freaking tiring to consecutively do beats!''Obviously, to be able to perform taiko well, you would really need to have the muscle and the stamina to do so.\xa0Shin-chan sensei told me that in Kodo, they have''VERY''intense training and practices\xa0since they are taught to\xa0attack their drums with their entire bodies and with a Zen-like concentration. Well, just by looking at the Kodo video above, I can definitely believe that!''After he let me have my fun with the big taiko drums for a few minutes, he led me to the smaller ones in the hall so that he could\xa0teach me how to properly play\xa0the taiko.''I initially thought that there was a special and complicated technique to it because Shin-chan sensei’s strikes sounded way too different from mine''(well of course, he was a professional after all)''. But anyhow, he told me to relax, to stand straight and to set my feet a bit wider apart than shoulder-width. Afterwards, he told me\xa0that I simply have\xa0to keep my bachi\xa0straight and that as I try to produce a sound, I needed to let both the weight of my\xa0bachi and my arm to fall down on the taiko\xa0…and that\xa0was it!''Unlike typical drum playing, he told me\xa0not to\xa0force the sticks down; instead, I have to\xa0let gravity do the work.\xa0I tried it again and my beats sounded way better than before!''…But then of course, to keep my arms playing was an entire matter of its own.''For the rest of our session, apart from learning other striking techniques, Shin-chan sensei and I did several pieces together: a part where he played several pieces in\xa0which I have to mimic them in return\xa0(and vice versa), and then a whole Japanese song that he taught me which I tried to memorize so that I could\xa0play it continuously without stopping.''By the end of it all, I bet that if my arms could talk, they would be complaining at how I’ve been skipping ‘arm day’ at the gym!''Nevertheless, learning and doing taiko drumming\xa0was SO\xa0much fun!\xa0Shin-chan sensei, like I already mentioned before,\xa0was also positively infectious given his\xa0overflowing energy. Therefore, it would be so enjoyable should you come to this hall together with your friends or your family!''.''Taiko Centre Programs''The majority of Sad Island Taiko Centre’s programs are geared for beginners.

If you fancy trying out coasteering, it is often done along the coast of Pembrokeshire.''#2:''Fact: Our flag is the best flag in the world''Ok so I might be biased but I mean come on… our flag has a dragon on it!''How cool is that?''The flag consists of 3 colors, green, white and red and is often claimed to be the oldest national flag still in use. There are many legends around why there is a dragon on our flag that originated from historic battles. The flag is called, “''Y Ddraig Goch”''which means… you guessed it: “The Red Dragon”.''#3:''You can surf in Wales''It might not be like surfing in Olon, Ecuador or Hawaii but yes, you can surf in Wales.''The Gower Peninsula''is home to some of the best beaches in the world and best surf breaks.

That being said, long hikes through the countryside or along the coast are both stunning to do while in Wales.''#6:''The national sport of Wales is Rugby''Welsh boys and girls are brought up to follow the Rugby. We are passionate and proud when it comes to watching the 6 Nations, Rugby world cup and even small local games. The rivalry between Wales and England is, still to this day, very real when it comes to Rugby.''#7:''Wales has over 600 Castles''After a few days of walking around Siem Riep in Cambodia you will get, “Temple’d out”. Only people who have''traveled around South East Asia''will understand that joke.''Well the same goes for Wales, but this time, it’s with castles! Big, small, maintained or half destroyed, whatever type of castle you want to see we have it. The biggest castle in Wales is named Caerphilly Castle and believe it or not, it leans more than the Leaning Tower of Pisa!''#8:''It will rain when you visit Wales''I fondly remember meeting another Welsh person when I went''liveaboard diving in Komodo'', Indonesia and the both of us couldn’t get over the how beautiful the weather was compared to back home.''Sorry to break it to you but unless you are very lucky, it will most likely rain when you visit Wales. Not the romantic “let’s go for a walk” type of rain but the type that makes you want to stay in bed for the whole day.

(Trips usually start on a Saturday and end on a Friday).''That being said, it’s best that you arrive a day or two earlier if you want to explore more of Split. After all, it has two amazing UNESCO heritage sites that you shouldn’t miss: the''Palace of Diocletian''and the historic walled town of''Trogir''.''A flotilla usually consists of about 5-8 yachts and the yacht that I was assigned to was\xa0owned by a\xa0skipper named Russell. After being introduced to him, I was\xa0introduced to my\xa0‘crew mates’: 3 girl friends from the UK, 1 solo traveler (like I was) also from the UK, and 1 couple from Australia. After talking with everyone, I just\xa0knew that I was going to have a great time!''(Spoiler alert: …and I sure did!)''We then set off to visit the 1st island of our voyage:''SESULA''in Solta island which was a small tranquil bay that largely depended on its fisheries, olive groves, and vineyards. Along the way though, we had our first taste of sailing lessons from Russell when he taught us how to adjust the sails — again, like what I’ve already mentioned above, you can learn how to sail with MedSailors and you’re free to aid or even take over the skipper’s duties (and you’re also free not to, of course).''When we arrived at the island, we had some time to enjoy the waters as we used the paddleboards that came free in the yachts. And when sunset was about to come, everyone in our flotilla came together to have some drinks by the bay and enjoy the sunset. It was some sort of welcome party as we got to know everyone else on the other yachts! It was then that I learned that the others were from places all over the world like US, Singapore, France, Italy, South Africa, etc.''Come night time, the skippers reserved tables for us at''Sismis Restaurant''and we had our first ever delicious Croatia Mediterranean feast. There were even some locals in the restaurant who were singing with an accordion so it really felt so lively!''A must try local Croatian specialty in the''konoba''(restaurant) is''Peka'', a\xa0baked dish with meat and vegetables made in a pot or tray)''Before the night ended, we headed to a small local bar by the beach to have some drinks with everyone.''.''»''DAY #2''«''Come morning, Russell prepared breakfast for us,\xa0and then\xa0we started sailing again in order to reach a spot in the middle of the sea that\xa0wasn’t too far away from Sesula. (At this point, we learned how to anchor the yacht!)\xa0We spent a good time of our morning there to do more swimming and paddleboarding together with the other yachts.''By lunch time, we reached the''PAKLENI''Islands’ Palmizana Bay which was an idyllic place that was not only a typical stopover or ‘parking spot’ for all the other sailing providers in Croatia but also an idyllic place with scenic bars by the beach. We spent a good amount of time here swimming in the waters and drinking cocktails at the''Laganini Beach Bar.''Some time in the late afternoon, we then boarded a water taxi (100 kuna, roundtrip) to reach the bustling town of''HVAR''that’s renowned for its nightlife. Armed with our cones of gelatos, we first explored this picturesque town and then headed up to the''Spanjola Fortress''(''Fortica Spanjola)''to get a breathtaking panoramic view of the port town''(as seen in the photo that’s located at the very top of this post).''After dinner, it was a more hardcore party night for us as we all went to''Kiva Bar''in Hvar — it was surely a night to remember!''.''»''DAY #3''«''By this day of sailing in Croatia, I could confidently say that I’ve earned my ‘sea legs’ (the\xa0ability to keep my\xa0balance and not feel seasick) — though the lingering ‘moving sensation’ once I was on land was a different matter of its own, but it wasn’t that bad. It just happens when you start living in a boat and you simply will just get used to it. (Rest assured, the waters here were pretty calm so no worries there!)''So from Hvar, we then set off to reach the next island:''VELA LUKA''which is Korcula Island’s largest town, and its promenade was surely lined with interesting cafes and restaurants. During that voyage, we spent our sweet time doing more swimming and we even tried attaching our paddleboard to our yacht so that we can ride it while we were sailing! It was tough, but surely manageable.''Once we were at Vela Luka, we had the liberty to choose a restaurant that we would want to dine in for dinner. You might have expected us to go our separate ways, but we all decided to stick together and dined in a pizza place (which was delish!). At one point of the day, we also went shopping for water floats… which was a funny experience because we ended up walking to such a far supermarket (which didn’t have any floats), only to find out later as we walked back that the shops closer to the port had what we needed. :P''Come night time, it was one of our more calmer nights and we all decided to just chill in our yacht — eating, drinking, and playing card games like UNO!''.''»''DAY #4''«''We landed on''KORCULA''Old Town on Korcula Island, a medieval city that has a succession of narrow streets that branch off from the spine of the main street like a fish bone — you bet that I had so much fun''‘getting lost’''in those streets!''Apparently, this design was used to reduce the effects of the wind and sun, and provide the citizens with more comfortable accommodation.''Must-do'': Sample''Posip''wine and see''St. Mark’s Cathedral''Other things that we did during the day in this island was wine tasting (for an additional cost of 80 kuna only).

We were all SO\xa0stoked about this''(especially since my crew and I knew that we could win it lol — WE’RE THE BEST *Spartan scream*)!''…However, the winds weren’t so optimal this day (it was weak) so we ended up cruising along the waves with everyone else. Nevertheless, if you’re lucky enough and you hold this event, I bet that you guys will have a swell time!''So for this 5th day, we amped up our water activities. Everyone in our flotilla anchored and cozied up in a nice coast and spent most of the morning having fun! Some of the other guests bought a water float where we could play beer pong, and then the skippers even thought of tying up several paddleboards together so that whoever reaches the end whilst running will be regarded as awesome (lol). It was actually a fun way to see who has really earned their “sea legs”!''After lunch, we\xa0proceeded to dock to''MLJET''which is an unspoiled island mostly covered by forest while the rest is dotted with fields, vineyards, and small villages. Up on the northwestern half would be the National Park where we found pine forests and spectacular saltwater lakes — we were all able to see most of the island by cycling (only 100 kuna to rent), which I absolutely recommend!''Make sure to spot the''Benedictine Monastery''in one of the lakes, and it’s also best that you keep your swimsuit underneath because there are spots where you are free to swim. Another activitiy that you can try is''kayaking''(only 50 kuna).''.''With the dawn of a new year,\xa0there’s sure to be several\xa0trips that you’re aiming or planning to take\xa0— and what better way to keep track of it\xa0all than to write it all down, right?''[ Where to Next ]''Sure, it\xa0may be the\xa0digital age now and you can type those all away on your gadget, but''nothing''surely beats keeping a journal or planner.\xa0That’s why,\xa0when it comes to planning and reliving such memorable adventures, there’s one that I believe is the best of them all: the''Where to Next''travel planner''!''.''Where to Next Travel Planner''Where to Next (WTN)''is a passion project between two friends, Ayen dela Torre and Rachel Halili.

Besides, these awards not only applaud AYANA\xa0for its resort, amenities, spas, villas, and rooms but also for its world-class service.

So when I was looking for the best company\xa0to support, I’ve\xa0come to read great reviews on MedSailors about\xa0how they perfectly handle their guests per\xa0yacht.''Not only do they make sure that everyone is grouped accordingly by age but by their travel style too: so for example,\xa0if you want to party more, they’ll put you with\xa0other guests who\xa0have the same aim. And naturally, if you want it to be more relaxed,\xa0they’ll put you with people who aim for a similar\xa0experience.''And the icing to the cake?''I even\xa0found out that they willingly teach their guests for FREE on how to sail! Ain’t that awesome?!''That being said, yes I do\xa0I have a fair idea now of how things work at sea. Surely not at a professional level, but at a level\xa0in which I can\xa0aid a skipper (a captain of a yacht/boat)!''»''The Voyage''For Croatia, MedSailors has two routes:''DISCOVERY:''Their most popular voyage.''Starts and finishes in Split with an optional private transfer to Dubrovnik for a separate fee. The destinations that you’ll normally be seeing will be Sesula, Vis (an ancient town), Gradina Bay, Hvar (a great port town), Stari Grad (for a wine tour), and Bol (where the popular beach Zlatni Rat is located).''.''VOYAGER:''Said to leisurely and relaxed, with more sailing involved.''This one on the other hand,\xa0starts in Split and ends in Dubrovnik (or vice versa).\xa0Much like the Discovery route, the Voyager route also explores Sesula and Hvar;\xa0but the other destinations are to Vela Luka (great for water sports), Korcula (for wine tasting), Mljet (to their National Park), and Sipan.''.''I know how it can be quite tough to pick a route\xa0between\xa0the two, but once you consider\xa0your travel style\xa0preference, your must-sees,\xa0your flight itinerary, etc. — it should end up becoming\xa0an easy pick!''Personally, since I really wanted to see Dubrovnik without the additional transfer time from Split, I ended up picking the''Voyager route.''.''PRE-TRAVEL GUIDE''Where to get the best flight deals''?''My go-to platforms for grabbing the best flight deals are''Momondo'',''Kayak'', and''Skyscanner''. But of course, it’s always good practice to research first the budget airlines that exist in the country that you’re currently staying in, since they could have rock-bottom prices that are not often visible in the above flight search engines.''Where to stay''?''Split = Luxury:''Raddison Blu Resort''/\xa0Mid-Range:''Divota Apartment Hotel''or''AirBnB''/\xa0Budget:''Apartments Gajeta''Dubrovnik\xa0= Luxury:''Villa Dubrovnik''/\xa0Mid-Range:''Berkeley Hotel''or''AirBnB''/\xa0Budget:''Dino & Jele Apartments''What to pack? What essentials to take note of?''For your luggage'':\xa0Pack the usual summer gear: sunglasses, sunscreen, swimming gear, and flip-flops. \xa0(They typically provide towels, but it’s great to bring one for\xa0yourself especially a thin beach towel). It’s also best to bring in a soft small luggage rather than a hard-case wheeled one — though,\xa0a carry-on size can work. This is\xa0so that you can have more room in your cabin during your stay.''Visa'':\xa0Take note that Croatia is NOT a part of the Schengen Area zone, so you will still need to apply for a tourist visa to Croatia''(unless you are a resident of the U.S., U.K., EU, Australia, New Zealand, etc. — just\xa0check''VisaMap''to verify)''. If you have a''multiple-entry''Schengen Visa, you can enter, stay and transit in or through Croatia WITHOUT the need for an additional Croatian tourist visa. If you have a single-entry Schengen Visa though, it’s not possible to go to Croatia without getting a separate Croatian tourist visa first. If however you have a resident visa in any of the Schengen member countries, you’re free to enter Croatia without a visa.''Insurance'': Purchasing a''travel insurance''for your trip is HIGHLY recommended. For the best price deal, go and purchase it from''World Nomads''.''Cash'':\xa0There are ATM’s in Split and Dubrovnik as well as in most of the other ports. The local currency is called as ‘Croatian kuna’. ($1 = 7~ Kuna = Php 45~)''Power Plugs'': All of MedSailors yachts have European power points for charging and their stereo can be connected to your iPod or iPhone.''One of the things that you absolutely should do when visiting Japan is try on their traditional full-length garment\xa0called:\xa0the''kimono''. This beautiful and elegant piece used to be worn by the Japanese on a daily basis; but nowadays, it is mostly only being worn by\xa0the locals during formal events, graduation programs, tea ceremonies, and festivals''(Japan’s''geisha''still wear it almost every day).''That being said, it can be quite a rare sight to witness\xa0a crowd\xa0of\xa0Japanese people wearing\xa0kimono\xa0on the streets\xa0—\xa0unless there’s an event. In fact… if you see someone dressed up in a\xa0kimono in public, that person would most likely be an expat or a tourist!''With that in mind, as a non-Japanese person,\xa0it''IS''possible for you to\xa0put on a kimono, walk around with it for a day, and take lots and LOTS\xa0of photos; you can do this\xa0simply by going to kimono rental shops that are spread out all over\xa0Japan.''The quintessential place to\xa0rent and wear a kimono\xa0would be in the ancient\xa0city of''Kyoto''; but if you’re short on time and can only explore the capital of''Tokyo'', don’t fret! Much like what I did, simply head over to the district of''Asakusa''and make full use of its picturesque shrine and temple as well as its olden''Edo''era buildings and surroundings as\xa0perfect backdrops for\xa0your pictures.''Now… don’t think that you can just buy your own kimono and proceed to\xa0put it on by yourself! First things first,\xa0a full\xa0kimono set customarily\xa0costs a fortune (a lot of Japanese people actually\xa0end up\xa0renting since it’s a\xa0lot cheaper; plus,\xa0they rarely use\xa0it too). Secondly,\xa0a kimono is an extremely\xa0intricate piece of clothing to put on\xa0as it involves a LOT\xa0of layers and knots; so, you can’t just wear it whimsically without any prior experience and knowledge. (Besides, someone\xa0typically\xa0helps put on a kimono for\xa0another person\xa0anyway, and these professionals usually take classes to learn how. Truth be told, one of the reasons why the Japanese rarely wear kimono nowadays is because they can’t put it on by themselves.)''With all those factors considered, it’s truly\xa0best that you head on over to a professional Japanese kimono rental shop in order to get\xa0a hassle-free experience that will save you\xa0time, effort, and money — and with the help of this guide post,\xa0it’s my hope that the overall process will be smooth for you.''After all, I personally\xa0rented a kimono for a day while I was in Asakusa, Tokyo during my first trip to Japan, and it was an experience that I will\xa0truly never forget and that I''absolutely''recommend for you to try alone, with friends, with family, or with your partner!''.''How to Rent a Kimono for a Day in Asakusa, Tokyo''»''Where to rent a kimono''Finding a good kimono rental shop can be tricky if you don’t speak Japanese since many\xa0of the owners in Asakusa —''or just Japanese people in general —''don’t speak English fluently, or at all.\xa0Rest assured, there are shops (like those I will list below) that do have\xa0employees who can speak''decent''English.''So where did I go off to?''I\xa0rather went to a rental shop called''YAE''. Why did I pick them? Well, when I was browsing for rental providers online, I noticed that YAE\xa0was providing more luxurious\xa0and sophisticated-looking kimono ensembles and designs compared to the other rental shops in the area''(it was complete with ribbon obi, decorative strings, etc.).''To illustrate:''What’s more is that\xa0a matching tote\xa0bag, zori (traditional Japanese slippers), tabi (socks), a complete hair styling session, and several\xa0hair accessories were already included in their base\xa0price.

But\xa0before I indulge you with the top things to do and see in the city that you won’t want to miss during\xa0this celebration, let me show you a brief video preview first of my experience:''.''Things to Do and See During Bastille Day in Paris''»''Witness the Military Parade (Défilé Militaire) at\xa0Champs-Élysées ~ 9AM''As I’ve already mentioned above, this is Europe’s oldest and largest regular military parade; therefore,\xa0it’s quite a sight to\xa0see!''All traffic will usually be closed starting at 7AM in\xa0Champs-Elysées and its surrounding streets, and it’s actually around 10AM that the program starts — however, I’ve mentioned 9AM because it’s always best to come early. Given the hype that surrounds\xa0this military parade, it can get very crowded!''So during this parade, trumpets would\xa0often first signal the arrival of the President of the French Republic, the Air Force will start cruising low in the sky either doing stunts or spreading colored smoke (of course in the colors of the French flag), and then the elite units of the Frency army will start to parade down the picturesque avenue down to''Place de la Concorde''on foot, on motorcycles, on horses, on tanks, on jeeps, etc.''Recently, it has even become a custom for France\xa0to invite units from its\xa0close allies to participate in the parade. For this year, they’ve invited troops from Australia and New Zealand.''HELPFUL TIPS'':''There will be a HUGE crowd. In fact, despite the recent attacks in Paris,\xa0there were still tons of people lined up on both sides of the avenue of\xa0Champs-Elysées — which was of course, good to see since it just shows that terrorism won’t ever\xa0stop anyone from traveling. Besides, security was quite tight! Anyhow, given that there will be lots of people, it’s advisable that you come early; or if you can’t,\xa0bring a stool to stand on (I’ve seen some people doing this).''It’s best\xa0to avoid standing underneath a big tree since you can miss seeing the aerial show during the parade. One of the best spots to be in would be below George V avenue.''Other options: come around 8AM or earlier to reserve a seat in one of the open\xa0cafés or restaurants in\xa0Champs-Elysées that are on an upper level of a building. Or you can also book your''AirBnB''or hotel that has the necessary vantage point to look over the avenue (just make sure there are no trees in the way of your view!)''Some of the metro stations near\xa0Champs-Elysées will be closed from 8AM until 12PM. They’re not always the same every year, but most of the time it’s the stations of Concorde, George V, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Champs Elysees Clemenceau, and\xa0Tuileries that will be closed. That being said, do make sure to check before you go!''Before and after the show, I took the\xa0Saint-Philippe du Roule metro stop and it was just a 5 minute walk to get to the avenue area.''To check which metro stations will be closed,''go here.''After the Bastille Day parade, you can walk on the\xa0Avenue des Champs-Elysées until 6PM since it transforms into a pedestrian-only road for the time being so go mad snapping pictures away in this spot!''.''»''Stroll Around Paris’ Sights or Watch a FREE Movie Outdoors\xa0~\xa0Rest of the Day''Though it is a national holiday, a lot of Paris’ restaurants, museums, and attractions stay open.

And even if there are nearby metro stations open after the Fireworks Show, they will be packed with people so I suggest that you wear comfortable shoes for walking since you might need to walk a bit further out from the Champs de Mars area to get to a metro station that is open and less crowded.''After the show, I had to walk a bit to reach\xa0Iéna metro station (since it was the nearest\xa0connection to''my hotel''located in Bastille neighborhood). Once I was there, I had to wait for 10 minutes still until the crowd thinned a bit more.''To check which metro stations will be closed,''go here.''If you think you can get a taxi or''Uber''— don’t.

In that instant, I was unable to\xa0take my eyes away, and I started to have the strong\xa0urge to get my hands on one!''I immediately messaged Kaila\xa0and asked what it was, where I could get it,''etc''… and that’s when she introduced me to the wonderful world of''Japanese souvenir jackets''called as''sukajan''.''.''Sukajan: A Japanese Souvenir Jacket''»''What is a''sukajan?''A\xa0“''sukajan''” is a ‘souvenir jacket’ from Japan and it is\xa0usually made of silk or satin that\xa0combines\xa0the typical bomber jacket / Letterman jacket / varsity jacket style with bold yet classic embroidered Japanese motifs such as tigers, eagles, koi fishes,''sakura''(cherry blossom), and more.''If you’ve watched the 2011 film titled ‘''Drive''‘, you would probably recognize this kind of jacket being worn by\xa0Ryan Gosling. Lately, there are a also growing number of celebrities (Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Harry Styles, etc), clothing brands, and fashion icons who have started to promote, sell and wear''sukajan''jackets — and it’s no surprise as to why!''TRIVIA:''there are a lot of theories as to where the term ‘''sukajan''‘ came from; some say that it is an amalgamation of the phrase ‘Sky Dragon Jumper’ in Japanese, or that it is a shorter term for the Japanese words: ‘Yokosuka Jumper’ / ‘Yokosuka Kanagawa’ (which is supposedly the place where this kind of jacket was first made).''»''History''The''sukajan''is said to be\xa0‘born’\xa0around post World War II in Japan when American soldiers\xa0started to ask for Japanese designs to be hand-stitched on the back of their jacket as a way of remembering their time in the country — hence the reason why a''sukajan''is called a ‘souvenir jacket’.''Most of the designs showed eagles (as a way to represent the USA) mixed with Japanese elements such as that of dragons, tigers, cherry blossoms, trees, traditional maps, geishas, etc. At times however, the art would look more Chinese than Japanese and that’s because during those times, the Americans wanted more “Asian” designs on their jackets; therefore, the Japanese tailors would occasionally refer to Chinese silk pillows for inspiration.''By the 1960s, the Japanese’s obsession towards the American style rose (called as “Ametora” in Japanese) wherein a lot of people started to wear American clothing like jeans and button-downs. But there are those who wanted to rebel from that kind of trend, so some Japanese people started to wear the''sukajan''as a statement piece of that defiance.''Over time, the''sukajan''evolved into a\xa0symbol for those in the''yakuza,''those involved in gangs or those who are simply delinquents. Nowadays though, the jacket predominantly became a fashionable yet edgy piece, treated as a medium for self-expression and/or storytelling.''»''My''sukajan''Since my first visit to Japan was during''sakura''season, I opted to go for a jacket that shows exactly that. And since I’m a sucker for anything dark\xa0(especially when it comes to my clothing), I naturally sought\xa0for something in black.''Kaila told me that they are selling these jackets on their ‘''Japan Lover Me''‘ store, so I immediately headed to their platform to\xa0pick a design that I wanted.''…I swear to you, I had a hard time picking because there were just SO many cool designs to choose from! Eventually though, I found the perfect''sukajan''for me and it looked like this:''koi fish and cherry blossom prints on one side, and a silver patterned design of dragons on the other.''Clearly, the photo above shows 2 designs and that’s because most''sukajan''jackets are''reversible''; mine was like that\xa0and it totally felt like I purchased 2 jackets for the price of one. The value for this was around $200 — pricey BUT… with the quality, design, and reversible characteristic of this item, I absolutely felt that I got more than what it’s worth.''That being said,''I absolutely love my''sukajan!''NOTE'':''Rest assured, there are cheaper\xa0sukajan jackets\xa0up on ‘''Japan Lover Me''‘''store,\xa0and some could start as low as $40!!!''.''Overall''Flying business class is\xa0placed\xa0high up on my bucket list — besides, who wouldn’t want to travel in utter luxury, style,\xa0and comfort (with ample leg space), right?\xa0So,\xa0you could imagine how happy I was when I\xa0finally checked this experience\xa0off of my list\xa0last month when I said\xa0‘''YES''‘ to''Singapore Airlines''‘\xa0invitation\xa0of flying\xa0with them to New Zealand and back!''Given that this was\xa0my first flight in business class, I\xa0was\xa0also quite giddy about\xa0the fact that\xa0it was with THE Singapore Airlines.

You’re such an inspiration, having traveled to different places already at a very young age. Being a digital nomad is such a brave move and though I prefer not to become one, I’m not closing my doors to it, especially to travelling.''Even with a corporate day job and being the eldest child with a lot of responsibilities on the shoulder, I didn’t let the factors “time” and “money” hinder my goals of travelling. Yes, it’s not easy, but it’s possible.''I choose to travel PH because aside from the fact that is is more budget-friendly, there are a lot of beautiful places in the country. Together with my boyfriend, we explored different provinces in the Philippines last year.''It all started when I became inspired whenever I see my colleagues travelling. I wanted to do it too, and so I started researching. I think that was why I stumbled upon your blog. I’m still not that courageous to try solo travelling so I have been bugging my boyfriend to come with me. Haha. I also like to try solo travelling someday, but that day would come at the right time. For now, I like a partner to travel with. :)''Our first trip was in Baguio and after a few trips that followed, it’s not only me who wanted to travel. He also got inspired! It even came to a point that he’s the one bugging me about the places he wants to visit!

We had arguments and misunderstandings but at the end of the day, we’re able to sort things out. We also get to discover a lot of things about each other.

But,\xa0the baguette myth is absolutely true!''If you walk in any city around 12pm, you will see tens if not hundreds of people carrying their baguette for lunch. This is tradition and must not be criticised.''#3:''French people are NOT rude.''People tend to think the French are generally rude. Like everywhere else, even if some are, we are not all rude.''However we do lack English-speaking skills, which means some people have a limited way to communicate with strangers, and this can be seen as rude. For example, a waiter in Paris might only know basic English words relative to his job, so he would not be able to ask you about your day, where are you from or what did you think of the food.''#4:''Some things are NOT really from France nor are they ‘French’.''So many things are so-called “French” in English that are truly not.''For example, French toast was born in Austria (and we call it “''pain perdu''”, meaning “lost bread”\xa0—\xa0don’t ask),''French fries are from Belgium'', a French escape is called in French: an Italian escape.''There are so many things that are supposedly French things but are not from France at all, and we sometimes have no idea that they’re supposed to, resulting in some awkward conversations with foreign people who assume we''“French kiss”''everything that moves!''#5:''French language is incredibly complicated.''That is a fact, and as a result, many French people don’t actually know how to spell properly. French expressions sometimes make no sense, and the use of gender confuses most English natives.''For example, a chair will be feminine, while a stool is definitely masculine. “''Tu as un poil dans la main''”, meaning “You have a hair in your hand” means “You’re lazy”\xa0— and\xa0so on and so forth.''So… good luck to everyone learning French!''#6:''French girls are NOT hairy or dirty, compared to some old clichés.''For some reason, the French are supposedly classy and elegant''YET''hairy and smell awful.''While I don’t really understand the paradox, I can assure you French girls aren’t hairier nor do they\xa0smell worse than your average American or Finnish girl. In France, we actually do have this same cliché about other countries, namely Germany and Portugal, but I’m sure that’s not a fact either.''#7:''We use various pronouns to address others.''In French we use different pronouns to address a friend and a person we don’t know or older than you. It’s a way to be polite and even though everyone will forgive a non-native French speaker for making a mistake, it’s usually not ideal to call you French father-in-law''“Tu”''as you would call you best friend.''Instead, use “''vous''” and the according verbs…. Once again, good luck.''#8:''French are\xa0kind of lazy.''French people are known to be lazy around the world. While we do have a 35 hours work week maximum and we do strikes A LOT, France is actually the 4th most productive countries in Europe, ahead of the UK and Germany!''We don’t work hard, but we work smart.''#9:''The French have a very particular humour.''Such\xa0is true to a certain extent. We do enjoy, for the most part, a dry and sometimes offensive humour, similar to the UK for example. But I can understand that some American people can find it a little bit inappropriate, but we just try to not take ourselves too seriously!''#10:''French people can be extremely proud.''While we are usually the first ones to criticise France, our government, and our fellow Frenchies, we do not authorise anyone who isn’t French to do the same.''I have the right to say the French are annoying and that I am not a fan of Paris, but don’t you dare!''.''Overall''It has been 3 years now since I last set foot in''Thailand'', and I know that\xa0I’ve barely scratched the surface of this wonderful destination because\xa0I’ve\xa0only visited that of Bangkok and Chiang Mai.

Nevertheless, the country\xa0undoubtedly has its own flair and one of the places that I have come to love was the area around''Uluwatu Temple.''I’ve walked this amazing stretch by foot under the sweltering heat, but the breathtaking views made up for it\xa0—\xa0so when I was given the chance to view it from up high with a helicopter tour ride provided by''eOasia''and Bali Adventure Tours, I gladly\xa0gave my''‘yes’''in a heartbeat!''I\xa0actually\xa0did this during my last day in''Indonesia''and for sure, it was\xa0a great way to mark the end of my trip especially since the experience\xa0was also\xa0my first time\xa0in a helicopter.''After the whole ordeal… I was''ecstatic.''All I could think of was that I could absolutely get used to helicopter rides, and if it’s possible to take one in''every''country that I will be visiting in the future then that would be fantastic!''.''Uluwatu Helicopter Tour''I was picked up from my hotel\xa0and brought to the private helipad of Bali Adventure Tours’ head office which\xa0was near Benoa. After a brief introduction, one of the organizers started to discuss\xa0the\xa0safety rules and instructions while riding the helicopter — at this point, my excitement was slowly building up as I proceeded to take in\xa0all of what was starting to happen before me.''Once we were done with the discussion, we headed out to the helipad and\xa0when I caught sight of the helicopter that we are about to be using for the tour, my excitement just simply shot through the roof.\xa0I really tried to contain my emotions but it was hard to, more so when they let me take the seat beside the pilot!''As I settled down in my seat, they handed me an aviation headset which was\xa0basically a noise-cancelling headphone\xa0but with a built-in microphone so that the pilot can communicate with us and vice versa during the duration of the tour.''After the head aviation office at the island’s main airport gave us the go signal to takeoff, I prepared myself for some sort of shaking spree\xa0or whatnot — but I’ve discovered that lifting off of the ground in a helicopter was actually pretty smooth.''In fact, the feeling was similar to when I’m riding a ferris wheel which as you might know has\xa0that\xa0very slight pull when\xa0it takes off of the ground\xa0and\xa0gains\xa0momentum\xa0to go\xa0up.''From then on, all that I felt was amazement and awe… after all, I was “flying” up high at a specific\xa0height that offered\xa0views not typically gained\xa0from\xa0my typical big airplane rides.''As for the summary of our\xa0flying route, we first went over''Serangan Island''which was also called by the Balinese as the ‘Turtle Island. We then crossed the flight path of''Ngurah Rai Airport''and proceeded to go around the''Bukit''area which has the famed''Garuda Wisnu Monument.''Heading west of Uluwatu, we caught glimpse of the area’s famous 5-star hotels and surfing beaches,\xa0and down south we witnessed Dreamland beach and''Padang Padang''surfing beaches.''And of course, the highlight of our helicopter tour: seeing the iconic Uluwatu Hindu temple that towers at the tip of a pictureque cliff!\xa0Before heading back to the head office, we flew over''Tanjung Benoa''that was a well-known spot for watersports.''In short:''the whole helicopter ride around this area of Uluwatu was jam-packed with scenic landscapes and everything was just so\xa0gorgeous\xa0beyond words —\xa0that’s why\xa0I will let the video and photos below do rest of the talking!''»''Tour Info''Duration:''25 minutes''Price:''$1,176.30 USD per group''Passengers:''Maximum of 5 with flight load limitation of 550kg''Inclusions:''Pick-up and drop-off at your hotel if it’s within these\xa0areas:''Nusa Dua, Tanjung Benoa, Jimbaran, Kuta, Legian, Seminyak, Kerobokan, Sanur''(or if you’re flying in from Ubud, they can provide a free pick-up too).''Mineral Water''Cold Towel''Overall''Not a lot of people know that real samurais NO\xa0longer exist in Japan''— the whole lifestyle and system have long disappeared ever since the\xa0late 1800s because the emperor favored a more modern western-style army. Nevertheless, what we can rather find solace in (apart from the existence of museums for appreciating the tradition) is that there are still some people in Japan who try to emulate the\xa0swordsmanship of the samurais, and\xa0should you ever land in''Kyoto'', there is one\xa0interesting person that you should absolutely meet…''the ‘Last Samurai’: Joe Okada!''»''Who is Joe Okada?''Joe Okada, who is dubbed as the''‘Last Samurai’,''is the oldest licensed English-speaking\xa0tour guide in Japan — he has been in the business for\xa0more than 50 years and he is already 86 years old as of this\xa0year (2016).''About 4 years ago, he started\xa0operating solely in Kyoto with his ‘''Cool Kyoto Walking Tour''‘, in which he dresses up as a samurai while\xa0he takes his guests to numerous interesting local hotspots. At the end of the\xa0tour, he usually showcases his samurai sword wielding skills which he has mastered for years\xa0— the definite highlight of his whole tour!\xa0Because of this and more,\xa0the city had appointed him in 2011 to serve as one of Kyoto’s Omotenashi''(hospitality)''Ambassadors.''Now how did he become Japan’s ‘''Last Samurai’?''Joe first worked at a fire station when he was 20 years old; however, he had always wanted to become a tour guide. To become one, he knows that he would have to learn English; so, he went to the United States for 8 months\xa0— not to study in a school, but to work as a driver and learn English through his daily life.''By 1962, armed with his English skills and touring knowledge, Joe passed a certification exam and became a licensed guide. He first worked with a travel agency but eventually went solo by 1968 and it was during this time that''‘Samurai Joe Okada’''was born.''Apparently, a lot of his customers thought that samurais still existed and they badly wanted to meet one. Samurais have disappeared a long time ago of course; but still, Joe wanted to give his guests at least a glimpse of the tradition that’s why he started practicing samurai swordsmanship. He eventually became very good at cutting apples in midair which led him to start his own samurai show in 1978\xa0— this\xa0became very successful for 13 years with over 130,000 guests! In fact, a\xa0lot of TV shows abroad\xa0have also invited him and one of his most notable appearances was in David Letterman’s 1998 show. In 1991 however, he had to cancel his show,\xa0but still continued being a tour guide.''TRIVIA'': Apple cutting in midair is one of Joe’s specialties when it comes to his samurai sword skills, and he has\xa0actually trained 2 Americans who made it to the Guinness World Records!!''Of course, I wouldn’t be talking about Joe here in my blog if I haven’t met\xa0him myself. So\xa0yes,\xa0I had the absolute\xa0pleasure of meeting him\xa0back when I first visited Japan, and I can honestly say that his tour was one of the most memorable things that I have ever gone through in my travels!''That being said, I definitely recommend that you take Joe’s walking tour in Kyoto''and I’m saying this\xa0not just because I’m sure you will love his samurai show and his whole tour, but also because I’m so sure that you will enjoy spending time with Joe. Besides,\xa0he\xa0is\xa0probably the most entertaining, funny\xa0—''stress on the funny!''—\xa0and interesting man that I have ever met!''.''The Cool Kyoto Walking Tour''TIME:''Every Saturday from 10AM to 3PM''WALKING LENGTH:''Around 4km''TO RESERVE YOUR SPOT:''Go to''Tinggly.com''PRICE:''$79 for 2 people, includes lunch and snacks (FREE for children under 12 years old)''The meeting place for Joe’s\xa0walking tour was at the''Kyoto City Hall''near''Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae''Station, and it wasn’t that hard to spot him\xa0in the crowd because he was wearing samurai clothing (''that looked like a kimono'') while\xa0holding\xa0his long sword — which didn’t seem obvious at first since it was wrapped in thick fabric, but a glimpse of the handle (''tsuka'') was a quick giveaway of what it was.''As I walked\xa0closer to him, I made a mental note about how domineering he looked… but the moment that he took notice of me, Joe flashed a big and warm smile towards my way\xa0which\xa0quickly\xa0washed away\xa0my initial estimation!\xa0We exchanged greetings and confirmed my booking for\xa0his tour, and it was at this point that I made a second mental note about how he spoke English very well\xa0—''a rather rare trait among the Japanese people (more so for the older people).''Once everyone was accounted for, Joe started to talk more about who he was, about his life during the war, and about Kyoto in general. He would also start to quip clever jokes here and there; sure\xa0some were cheesy, but never too cheesy that it left all of us in smiles. From then on, I already had a really good feeling about Joe’s tour!''Our first stop that day was\xa0to an art exhibition in''Teramachi''Street called as''Yokaan''.\xa0Joe told us that the displays here change from time to time, and what was being shown during our visit\xa0were''byōbu''or Japanese folding screens with decorative painting\xa0that are typically used to separate sections inside rooms.''Since one of the''byōbu''had an illustration of a''sakura''(cherry blossom) tree, Joe even started to share facts and trivia about it. THIS\xa0will be a recurring theme when you’re with Joe\xa0because\xa0he\xa0wouldn’t hold back in sharing interesting information that are unique not only to Kyoto but to Japan as a whole! And since he’s like a fountain of information, a lot of us in the tour wouldn’t hold back either in asking questions.''Our next stop was to a shop full of''sake''(this means alcohol, but the term\xa0also refers to Japanese rice wine) called as''Tomiya Shoten''.''It was here that we were all able to try a shot of''sake''while Joe joyfully quips that it’s never too early to drink liquor!''Moving on, Joe led us to a crafts store called''Hanzuyoshimi''which was owned by a lovely couple — a perfect place for buying gifts and souvenirs.\xa0At this point, it was clear\xa0that these Kyoto shops’\xa0owners have become or are good friends with Joe.''Without missing a beat, Joe led us to a nearby store that was selling traditional Japanese footwear called as''geta''which are\xa0customarily\xa0used to keep one’s kimono from touching the ground''.''There were different varieties to it but the most interesting one was the one-tooth clog called as''tengu geta''.''This pair\xa0was around 20cm high and\xa0Joe told us that they\xa0are mostly used for training in sports like mountain climbing, cycling, and martial arts in order to build up agility, balance and strength.''There was also an adjacent shop that were selling''konpeitō''or Japanese sugar candy which were apparently handmade by artisans (wherein its preparation can take up to 7 to 13 days!)''Zohiko''was the next establishment we visited in Kyoto and they\xa0were selling\xa0specialty tools and artistic lacquer goods. All of the items in this place, though pricey, were all handmade with designs that were simple yet\xa0exquisite and detailed!''This was followed by a visit to''Kobaien'', a Japanese''shodo''(calligraphy) store\xa0and\xa0Joe took his time to demonstrate to us how locals\xa0would use the special brushes and ink here to write in Japanese characters. He even gave some of us\xa0the opportunity to learn our\xa0Japanese names and write it with the brush — now of course, I gladly volunteered!''I found out that\xa0my name is “Airin” (アイリーン) in Japanese, and after I copied the way Joe wrote it on the paper, he gave me the\xa0score of''B+''.''Fair enough. ;)''Since it was almost noon, we made a stop\xa0at''Suehiro'', a Kyoto sushi shop that gave us''oinari-san''or''inarizushi''to try. This was a type of sushi that has rice wrapped around a tofu pouch and thereafter deep fried — and they tasted so good!''We also stopped by a local bakery shop to munch on some bread.''.''SAMURAI SHOW''Finally, it was time for Joe’s famed''Samurai Show!''I would have loved to describe ALL the things that Joe has done, but I think it’s best that I let the photo and video below do the talking. For a short say though,\xa0with his sword skills, it’s hard to think that Joe is more than 80 years old!''NOTE:''Joe gladly takes on apprentices and\xa0he has already\xa0trained 2 Americans who made it to the Guinness World Records!''All throughout his performance as well, he would ask for volunteers from time to time and and I gladly joined the part where he sliced apples in midair (his best-known skill!)''» Video below is a full recap of his tour, if you want to jump to the samurai show, play at 01:24''Afterwards, we continued the rest of our tour to''Kyoto Gyoen National Park''where we made a stop in a Japanese garden and tea house called as''Sushuitei''. (There was a 100 yen entrance fee to this place, but it was already included in the tour).''This\xa0was such a tranquil and scenic area, and\xa0I’m sure that if I were living in Kyoto, I would be visiting this place regularly especially if I want some quiet time alone.''What followed after this was a brief stop to the''Kyoto Imperial Palace''where Joe talked more about Kyoto’s history, festivals, samurais, geisha, and more. (During our walk, Joe spotted bird watchers in the corner of the park and this became an opportunity for us to mingle even more with the locals as they share with us their prized photos of their bird watching discoveries).''As our tour draws to a close, we headed off to\xa0the''Demachi''Shopping Arcade where we got to try local street food and sushi!''While we stood there, I found myself\xa0suddenly overwhelmed by a wave of nostalgia\xa0— NOT\xa0because I have been there before, but because the place\xa0had\xa0the kind of facade that was typical in the Japanese shows and''anime''that I have been watching ever since I was young… It absolutely made me happy to have finally seen and experienced this\xa0off-the-beaten-path destination such as this!''Before bidding goodbye, Joe told me\xa0to join my\xa0hands together\xa0(as if in prayer) when I asked to have a photo with him. He said that this signifies peace, and along with it is his wish that we would both meet again in the future —''that’s a wish that I also wish for!''NOTE'': The stops can differ from tour to tour depending on the season and depending on Joe’s whim ;)''Back when I visited''Bali''in April,\xa0I sought for accommodations that would rightfully match the beauty of the island — it is called as the ‘''Island of the Gods''‘ after all!\xa0And well… my search was actually difficult because there''were''a lot of dreamy accommodations speckled across this destination. However, I’ve come to discover\xa0that\xa0when it comes to''affordable luxury in a boutique villa resort'',\xa0picking a staycation can be a very\xa0easy task since I’ve discovered a\xa0prime\xa0choice\xa0nestled within the hills of Uluwatu:''Hidden Hills Villas!''Though my\xa0stay here has been brief as I hopped from one location to the next within Bali, it was an experience that already gave me\xa0an ethereal feel of ‘paradise’''Here’s why…''– THE RESORT –''“Brings the World Together”.''With its 6 uniquely-designed villas, I have felt\xa0as if Hidden Hills Villas can become a worldwide endeavor in itself\xa0— there were various influences from Greece, China, Morocco, Indonesia, and more!

As some of you may know, these types of Japanese beef are expensive — BUT!\xa0I’m willing to pay the price since it’s an absolutely unique and worthy experience that I’ve been dying to try, especially in the country that it has originated\xa0from.''Teppanyaki''is a special cooking style\xa0in Japanese cuisine that uses an iron griddle to cook food that can range\xa0from meat, seafood to vegetables. (''Teppan''means iron plate in English, and''yaki''means broiled, grilled, or pan-fried.) Typically as well, teppanyaki chefs would cook in front of their guests — sometimes,\xa0even with a special show as they juggle their utensils, flip eggs in the air, etc. (but this performance is\xa0more commonly done in the United States and NOT in Japan).''Regarding the meat though, you might be wondering why I put emphasis on\xa0the world “real” for the Kobe beef part.''Well this is because the export and use of authentic and trademarked Kobe beef from Japan is highly restricted. In fact, it was only in 2012 that they started to export the meat (it was to Macau) and today, though it has expanded to other\xa0places like the United States, Europe, Canada, Singapore, Philippines, and more, the''list of restaurants''that serve genuine Kobe beef\xa0are still NOT\xa0that many.''So if by some chance you paid a hefty amount for a slice of Kobe beef before 2012, you\xa0were most certainly ‘scammed’ because\xa0anyone was\xa0free to use the term ‘Kobe’ (given how\xa0it\xa0is not trademarked\xa0outside of Japan.)''»''Top 3 F.A.Q. About Kobe Beef''1''.''What exactly is Kobe beef? And why is it expensive?''.''.''Kobe beef comes from a PURE lineage of''Tajuma-gyu''cattle that has been born in the Hyogo prefecture in Japan and has been certified by the Kobe Beef Distribution & Promotion Council.\xa0Also, for it to be called ‘Kobe’, it still has to go through a strict government grading exam via the\xa0Japan Meat Grading Association\xa0wherein once assed, it will\xa0carry a\xa010-digit identification number.\xa0(Truth be told, the criteria for beef to be certified as Kobe beef are the strictest in Japan!)''These Tajima-gyu cows which are also called as “motoushi” or purebred seedstock cattle have maintained a pure bloodline since the Edo period (1615 to 1867) which also means that its delicious taste has been protected — hence, this is one of the reasons why it is expensive. Other factors that contribute to the Kobe beef’s\xa0high price tag is its scarcity and the high-quality feed that is being fed to the cows.''TRIVIA:''“Wagyu” means ‘Japanese Cattle’ so it is a generic term that refers to ALL of Japan’s cattle breeds. It is further divided into 4 breeds:\xa0Japanese Black, Japanese Brown, Japanese Poll, and Japanese Shorthorn. Tajima-gyu from which Kobe beef comes from is classified under Japanese Black breed.''Meanwhile, if you’ve heard of the term''kokusan-gyu'',\xa0this refers to all cows that are raised within Japan, in which it has spent more than half of its life there.''2''.''How then can I know that I’m eating real Kobe beef?''.''.''First and foremost, if you’re planning to dine\xa0at a restaurant, you can check by''the official list on the\xa0Kobe Beef Distribution & Promotion Council''to check which are the authorized establishments\xa0that have been granted the right to serve it.''Another good indicator is the price wherein an ounce should cost around $55 (or Php 2,500+). So if you’re ordering a burger that’s said to have Kobe beef on it and it costs only around $10, then you should be wary since\xa0they’re just evidently slapping the term ‘Kobe’ on a Japanese kind of beef that they got their hands on.''Meanwhile,\xa0if you’re planning to buy retail or wholesale, the website also shows the authorized distributors. Once you’re there, feel free to ask for a proof of certification as well to ensure that you’ve got your money’s worth.''3''.''Is it true that for Kobe beef\xa0cows’ rearing methods, they are made to listen to music, are being given beer, and massaged?''.''.''To answer this question, the Kobe Beef Distribution & Promotion Council said that…''There may well be some farms rearing low numbers of cattle who are doing things bordering on this. But, this does not mean that these rearing methods are all standards for producing prime Kobe Beef. For example, if you make it a custom of playing music at feeding time, then the cows as a conditioned reflex know that it’s feeding time just by hearing the music, and this, it is said, increases their appetite. However, the affect of music improving meat quality has not yet been proved. There is also the theory that beer is useful in improving cows’ appetites. Actually, however, it can be said that there have been almost no cases of cows being raised on beer. And, massage, too, is considered to be useful in lowering cows’ stress because of the close, physical contact it provides and in indirectly helping to improve the quality of the meat. Once again, however, massage itself neither softens meat nor increases the amount of marbling.''Now let’s move on to my actual mouth-watering affair at a teppanyaki restaurant!''First and foremost: I know that\xa0I could have just gone to any Japanese steakhouse to get my dose of wagyu beef; however, I wanted to undergo the experience of such a special\xa0cooking style. Besides,\xa0it is said that a high-quality''teppan''and skilled chef can make a HUGE difference to the flavor of a steak\xa0— so, if you\xa0combine those features with an\xa0ever-so-tasty Japanese beef\xa0then I was sure I’ll be in for a treat.''And boy… I really was!''Teppanyaki Experience''Thanks to''Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo'', I was able to try teppanyaki at\xa0their''Yamanami''teppanyaki restaurant\xa0which was duly\xa0accredited on the\xa0Kobe Beef Distribution & Promotion Council’s list.''They offer selections from their\xa0à la carte but you can also opt for a set menu. Since I was in Japan during''sakura''(cherry blossom) season, they naturally had a ‘Sakura’ set and that was what I\xa0was given\xa0for dinner. The total cost for it was 20,000 yen\xa0or $198~ (Php\xa09,200~) — a substantial price but I kid you not: it was''all SO\xa0worth it.''Let me tell you why!''Yamanami\xa0is led by the distinguished Master Chef Juniichi Hirano and the restaurant’s interiors have a unique design that mixes elements from the west and the east. Their western counters presents a superb view of the city’s skyscrapers, while the eastern counter faces a Japanese style roof garden.''I was ushered to my seat at the western counters\xa0by a waitress dressed in traditional''kimono,''after which''I was introduced to my chef for the day. (Apparently, every customer here gets their own designated chef for a more personalized experience with a maximum of 4 people for every 1 chef.)''He started to show me the fresh ingredients that he will be using… and when I laid my eyes on the beautifully\xa0marbled* pink slabs of Hida beef and Kobe beef, I instantly felt giddy and excited!''*Marbled meat contains various amounts of fat, giving it an appearance that’s akin to a marble pattern. Marbling can be influenced by selective breeding and the type of feed that is being fed to the cattle.''TRIVIA:''Hida beef is a first-class (wagyu) Japanese beef brand raised in Gifu Prefecture that rivals Kobe beef, and\xa0has meat quality that is classified with the A/B rank and the 5/4/3 grade — this\xa0basically means that it’s damn good.''*Hida beef, Kobe beef, and Matsuzaka beef are arguably the most famous beef types from Japan.''But before that ‘fun’ starts, first:\xa0the appetizers. I was given a fruity soft cake and a dish of greens to start with.''While I was gobbling that up, the chef\xa0started to cook the seafood (prawns and abalone) right before my very eyes and it was then that I realized how skillful he was as he maneuvered the food with his\xa0tools in\xa0precise and swift movements.''He even\xa0made sure that a long metal tool\xa0was positioned before the food in order to avoid the oil from splattering over to my side.\xa0Additionally, I noticed that the iron griddle was spotless!\xa0They seem to\xa0absolutely\xa0ensure it remains in tip-top shape, which is so unlike other teppanyaki restaurants that I’ve seen on videos that\xa0typically have burnt surfaces!''On to the grilled vegetables, I had some greens, mushrooms, beans, eggplant slices, and onions. These were paired with 2 sets of sauces and some salt. This, partnered with the seafood, were perfectly cooked — surely\xa0a wonderful prelude to the upcoming highlight of the whole teppanyaki set!''I asked the chef to cook my steaks medium rare (don’t you ever order steaks ‘well done’!), and I watched in anticipation as the slices of Hida beef and Kobe beef\xa0slowly turned from pink to brown on the outside, while still remaining its redness in the middle.''When he started to cut them into cubes, I had to hold my breath as I saw how effortless it was for him to slice it all… it really looked''sooooo''soft and tasty!''He proceeded to serve this on a plate that had crispy slices of garlic, pepper, and wasabi. I was told that I can eat the beef slices as is, but he also suggested that I try eating a cube with a slice of garlic on top or with a small dash of pepper.''Of course, I took a bite first with no add-ons on it. I had a chunk of Hida beef followed by the Kobe one… and they. Were. Both. DIVINE!!!''It’s difficult to put into words how amazing it all was, but there’s one statement which I’m sure of is very close to describing the experience:''“they\xa0literally melted inside my mouth, leaving a taste that was ridiculously rich and buttery.”''There wasn’t any need for me to chew so much, and every bite that I took made me want to cry —''I’m not kidding, I really wanted to cry at how good it was!''— because the Hida and Kobe beef were\xa0absolutely the BEST\xa0kinds that I have ever tasted. (With Hida beef having a taste that’s ‘fattier’ than Kobe.)''In fact, every kind of steak that I have tasted before''(U.S. ribeyes, T-bones, tenderloins, etc.)'', no matter how highly-graded they were, they simply have all suddenly paled in comparison!''Yet\xa0of course, I wholly recognize the fact that taste is subjective. It’s even hard to say that Hida and Kobe beef topples everything else; but… I bet that once you get a taste of these, you’ll find that they might just very well be on top.''After my first few bites, I paired it off with some garlic and pepper and the overall flavor was amplified even more!''(''NOTE'':\xa0I hate wasabi; so I didn’t even try that, but I bet it would have tasted good too especially if you’re into its taste).''By the way, before this teppanyaki affair, I was told by a dear friend of mine that these kinds of wagyu beef are\xa0decadent treats that are\xa0best taken in small quantities, which is basically why they are customarily served in small portions.''Knowing that fact beforehand, I tried my best to chew slowly as I savored each and every bite.''(…If I may point out, while I’m writing this article, a wave of nostalgia is overwhelming me and I’m now badly craving for it!)''TRIVIA:''Hida and Kobe beef both contain high levels of unsaturated fatty acids that melt at much lower temperatures than saturated fat. This is the reason why they dissolved on my\xa0tongue so fast!''But that didn’t end there. Before I finished up my slices, the chef quickly\xa0cooked some garlic rice and served it to me with miso soup and pickles.''Whilst\xa0I was basking in the afterglow,\xa0I was given a dessert plate which had apple pie paired with''azuki''(red bean) ice cream… At this point, I was a bit afraid of eating it because I still wanted to keep the lingering beef taste in my mouth.''But\xa0then I gave in and\xa0I found it as a fitting ‘end’ to my\xa0whole teppanyaki meal; plus, it didn’t even take away the whole aftertaste!''Meanwhile, you can also watch my video (vlog) below that showcases the whole of the experience in motion!''.''Do you need to apply for a Japan Tourist Visa?''Click here to find out how!''.''For all the Hello Kitty fanatics out there, I bet that there has been a time where you wished\xa0to stay (or even live) in a themed Hello Kitty room.''Well, guess what…?''You now have the chance to make that dream come true and check it off your bucket list, because''Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo''in Japan has original Hello Kitty rooms available in two stunning themes!!

Since I haven’t been drinking liquor for over 3 years, I found myself loving the plum wine more because\xa0of its sweet,\xa0fruity and non-strong alchoholic taste.''All in all, this yakitori stop at the charming town of Yurakucho was a lovely prelude to our 3-hour long walking food tour!''Moving on, we\xa0proceeded to hit the busy streets of Ginza which held\xa0a striking contrast to the olden and relaxed vibe of its neighbor, Yurakucho. Needless to say, this\xa0was an absolutely interesting change of pace!''TRIVIA:''Ginza is said to be one of the most luxurious shopping districts in the world, making it a heavenly location\xa0for shoppers because of its upscale shopping scene\xa0full of virtually every big\xa0international brand that exists. To add, the price of land here is the highest in Japan and it can cost about 30 million yen (or around $260,000) per square meter!''Aaah… luxurious it truly was\xa0because\xa0Ginza was packed with one ostentatious building after another! Makiko also led us\xa0to the main shopping street called as''Chuo Dori''wherein we witnessed one of the iconic landmarks of Ginza: the Hattori Clock Tower on top of Wako building.''During our leisurely stroll, we stopped by a small store called as''Ginza Akebono''that sold several flavors and types of''mochi''(sticky rice cake) which\xa0were not only great-tasting but affordable too!''By the way, I noticed\xa0that this store had a lot of Japanese shoppers — that’s when Makiko told me a valuable tip about traveling in Japan:''always buy from stores that are either crowded or have long queues of Japanese people because it\xa0typically means that the shop\xa0sells things that will be worth your time and money!''Before leaving the hustle and bustle of Ginza, I was whisked away to one last stop:''Mitsukoshi.''At first I was wondering: “What interesting thing\xa0can there possible be in this\xa0department store…?” That’s when Makiko introduced me to the wonderful world of''depachika''.''Made of the words''depato''(department store) and''chika''(basement), much like what\xa0the name suggests, a depachika is customarily located in the basement floor of department stores and you may as well call them as ‘food markets’ because I found out that it\xa0is in here that you can see a VAST variety of dishes and snacks\xa0— which can really serve as a great introduction to Japanese food!''Most of the things here are not cheap though (imagine, I saw a melon that sells for $500!!!) BUT you are always free to try samples if there are any. Nevertheless, visiting\xa0a depachika is\xa0a very\xa0interesting experience in itself and I was glad that I was introduced to this place where\xa0tourists wouldn’t normally end up in.''Now, we headed off to our last stop and ‘eating affair’ which was somewhere near\xa0Torigin and Shimbashi. In here, I was introduced to one of the traditional dishes in Japan:''kamameshi''(“kettle rice”) which is a rice dish (with meat and vegetables) cooked in an iron pot called as ‘kama’.''This was a very savoury dish and Makiko told me that the slightly burned rice at the bottom is one of the best things about kamameshi because it adds a desirable flavor to it overall! At the same time, she also taught us how to properly eat the special''tamago''(Japanese omelette) that the restaurant gave as a starter as well as how to properly hold a chopstick and a bowl together.''To get a ‘peak’ into our whole food tour from Yurakucho to Ginza and Shimbashi, you can also watch this video (vlog) that I made:''Before bidding goodbye, I managed to find out more about Anne’s company and I discovered that Arigato Japan also offers other amazing\xa0tours and courses (such as a sushi-making workshop!)''Sure enough, going by what I have experienced with them, I can absolutely recommend their company\xa0as well as the\xa0other services that they provide which are as follows:''•''All Star Tokyo Food Tour''– 3-hours to Yurakucho, Ginza, and Shinbashi''•''Odaiba Food Tour''– 3 hours''•''Golden Gai Food Tour''– 3 hours to Shinjuku and Kabukicho''•''Roppongi Food Tour''– 3 hours with stops to Azabujuban and Kill Bill Restaurant''•''Osaka Food Tour''– 3 hours to Dotonbori and Kurumon''•''Shimbashi Food Tour''– 3 hours of izakayas and standing bars''•''Shibuya Food Tour''– 3 hours of Hokkaido and Hiroshima food''•''Kyoto Tours''– Nishi Market Walking Food Tour, Gion Walking Food Tour at Night and Kyoto Sake Brewery Tour''»» See all''here''.''•''Washoku Cooking Class''– tradisional set meal in Japan''•''Maki & Sushi Class''–\xa0make 3 kinds of sushi: oshizushi, temari, and flower mosaic maki''•''Japanese Bento''–\xa0learn how to make a typical Japanese lunch box''•''Gyoza Cooking Class''–\xa0learn how to make 2 kinds of gyoza (Japanese dumplings) with 2 other side dishes''•''Wagashi''– make traditional Japanese sweets that are often served with tea''»» See all''here''.''***Given that they are a new company, do expect more tours and workshops to be offered\xa0all over Japan!''Do you need to apply for a Japan Tourist Visa?''Click here to find out how!''.''Christmas season may still be months away; but at this point in time, I bet that you are already drafting up plans as you try to come up with a great holiday getaway.

This platform has been a huge lifesaver for me and you should definitely take advantage of it.''.''Travel during low season or ‘shoulder season’ (somewhere in between low and high):''this is a no-brainer but it’s a golden rule especially if you want to travel on a budget. After all: timing is key when you make your travel plans\xa0since you can achieve\xa0cheaper prices across everything (from food to transportation)!\xa0Typically, the high season to avoid is summer and\xa0winter — BUT this is a case to\xa0case basis as dependent\xa0on your destination(s), so it’s best that you research this beforehand.''.''Try to be in fewer places but for a longer time:''if you go on a rush spree to tick countries off of your bucket list, you will find later on that taking too many of those flights or train journeys in such a short span of time will quickly eat away your travel fund. So try and do more of slow travel; not only will you get a better ‘feel’ of the country that you’re in, but you’ll also get to spend lesser as you grab hold of more discounted prices''(example: availing\xa0a discounted 1-month\xa0rental\xa0at''AirBnB''will be cheaper than the total sum of multiple short AirBnB bookings).''.''Travel with someone in order to share costs:''it’s always fine and dandy to travel\xa0solo, but if you really want to save, it’s best to find a friend or partner who is willing to go on the same journey as you do so that you can split costs 50:50 — it will surely be a win-win situation for the both of you!''.''Travel to low-cost-of-living countries and/or visa-free countries first:''this advice applies best especially if you’re someone like me who holds a third world passport.

When it comes to train travel, know your options too! A one-for-all railpass will give you big savings if you’re going around a certain area a lot''(example: traveling around Japan with''JR Pass''or traveling around Europe with a Eurail train pass)''; however, when it comes to shorter trips, point-to-point tickets will commonly be\xa0cheaper. That being said, ensure that you do your research well as you compare all of your options.''Additional Tips'': I generally don’t bother with first-class tickets especially when first-world countries are concerned, because the\xa0second-class\xa0sections are often of the same quality (and leg space!)\xa0like that of the first-class.''Meanwhile, for travels within large continents, consider doing''ridesharing''(which is different\xa0from hitchhiking which I don’t really recommend). There are various providers for every destination and the best ones that I know of are…''For Europe:''Blablacar''For USA:''Zimride''For Japan:''Noritomosan''For India:''Ridely''Another thing that you can try when you’re in Europe is''Busabout''which is a hop-on-hop-off bus service that can be an alternative for Eurail or Interail passes.''.''Get\xa0cheap flight tickets:''make use of flight search websites that scan through all available airlines worldwide on\xa0your route. Through this way, you can gain access to\xa0the best ticket prices possible! My go-to platforms are usually''Momondo'',''Kayak'', and''Skyscanner''. Of course, you could always go directly to an airline’s website; but in order to save you the time, effort, and money, it’s\xa0best to simply head on to\xa0country-specific websites such as''Traveloka''for the Philippines which\xa0let’s you compare and book flights in your locale\xa0with no hidden charges.''Additional Tips'': Firstly, some travel websites can track your searches and they can raise their prices after knowing that you’re interested in a certain\xa0route at a\xa0particular date. In order to\xa0curb this ‘feature’,''always\xa0use an ‘incognito window’''or clear your cache before searching.''Secondly, try to''book your tickets no more than 3 months''before your departure dates; this is because fares are discounted and ‘locked in’ customarily on the 8th week from your travel date. If you book too early or too late, you might not enjoy those sale deals.''Lastly, studies say that you’ll''find the lowest airfares on a Tuesday around mid-afternoon up to Wednesday''. The reason for this is that most carriers release sales during this day; plus, it’s customary for some airlines as well to put their prices up on Friday and if no competitors match their price, they will start putting it back down around Monday to Tuesday.''.''Get\xa0free flights:''sign up for a travel credit card and start earning points and miles as early as now! There are also a lot of credit cards available today that can already give you\xa0bonus points right from the moment that you sign up.''(If you’re from the U.S., you can check''this article''for the best travel credit cards available).''.''Watch out\xa0for\xa0‘error fares’, flight deals, and vacation package deals:''you could sign-up to e-mail alerts on flight search websites so you’ll be notified when the price fluctuates for your particular route.

Otherwise, you could also\xa0subscribe to websites like''Secret Flying'',''Holiday Pirates'', or''The Flight Deal''which\xa0regularly post error fares and crazy flight deals for any given time period.''Additional Tips'': For travel deals in general, check your local coupon sites and\xa0other international websites like''Travel Pirates'',''Deal Base'', and''Travel Zoo''.''.''Join travel contests:''the chances are slim\xa0BUT there’s no harm in trying your luck!

The price for public transportation might not seem much at first but if you add it all up, it can be a pretty hefty sum. Anyhow, walking around can also help build up your travel experience since it can lead you to scenic places that you wouldn’t normally find on a map.''.''Or make the most of public transportation:''there are times that walking just won’t cut it. Therefore if your destination is simply just too far, go for public transportation and avoid taxis like a plague. When\xa0you decide to this, calculate the number of rides that you might have to take and see if a ‘''day pass''‘ for public transit\xa0will be cheaper than buying individual tickets. Sometimes, city passes that already gives you access to attractions and museums have added perks of free public transportation too; hence, you better check those out!''.''Be flexible with your accommodation bookings:''it helps to not be so stringent with your schedule because as you travel, you could meet local folks\xa0or families who would be more than glad to accept you in their home for free. There could even be hostels that are willing to take you in with no pay per night as long as you help them with some chores.''.''Mind your money and the currencies abroad''Avoid getting your currency at the airport:''because they usually don’t offer the best rate. It’s better to withdraw from local ATMs with your debit card — as long as you keep in the mind the charges of\xa0your bank. (''TIP'': Make your withdrawal less frequent and worth the charge by taking\xa0out larger sums.)''.''Save up on food!''Do as the locals do:''to travel on a budget\xa0=\xa0try out street food, dine in local restaurants (that are not within 6 blocks from a major tourist site), shop for your own food at a local market, then cook your own food, go to a local pub during happy hour, etc. etc. etc.''.''Dine with a local:''websites like''WithLocals''connects you to local hosts who would happily share with you their home-cooked local cuisine at a price cheaper than what you’d normally pay at a restaurant. To add, this would be a great way for meeting new people!''.''Get travel insurance''Save yourself from possible\xa0hassles and costly troubles:''buying a travel insurance might seem like an unnecessary expense\xa0that will bite a chunk off of your travel fund, however it’s absolutely imperative to buy one so you can avoid spending more on events that can almost always happen during your trips:''lost luggage, delayed flights, missed flights, cancelled flights, unwanted injuries, hospitalization,''and SO much more! If you’re asking for the best-for-value travel insurance out there?''World Nomads''is the answer. One of the things\xa0that I love about them too is the ability to re-extend your insurance while you’re on the road — which is unlike most travel insurances that want you to be in your home country for extensions. That’s certainly\xa0a feature that will help us nomads and non-stop travelers\xa0alike!''UPDATE (As of 2017)''Have you ever\xa0watched the movie: ‘''Memoirs of a Geisha''‘''? Or have you read the book? I’ve done both\xa0at a young age and I instantly fell in love with Japan’s''geisha''as I witnessed\xa0their\xa0unique\xa0beauty, grace, and discipline. In fact, ever since then, I have been deeply enamoured by their mystifying\xa0world''— which, thankfully, have still survived up to this day!''I say ‘survived’ because I was also\xa0interested in\xa0the''samurai''(Japan’s olden warriors who typically serve a feudal\xa0lord or''daimyo'')''.''I badly wanted to witness their noble way of life; however,\xa0it made me terribly sad\xa0when I learned that\xa0they\xa0no longer exist, and this is\xa0because\xa0their social class\xa0has died down long ago around the late 1800s after the emperor favored a more modern western-style army. Sure, there may be descendants\xa0and even people who still try to practice\xa0samurai behavior and/or swordsmanship today,\xa0BUT\xa0it’s not the same given how\xa0the\xa0whole samurai lifestyle and system is absolutely non-existent\xa0anymore.''The geisha tradition is\xa0not as old\xa0as the samurai but it IS old and I’ve surely developed some sort of mild fear\xa0that the geisha might eventually disappear too —''which I hope to goodness, they won’t''— and this worry of mine makes a bit of sense because there aren’t many\xa0geisha\xa0anymore. To put\xa0it into numbers, back in the 1920s they numbered around 80,000. Their\xa0current number?''It is now estimated to be only 1,000 to 2,000!!''Because of this and more,\xa0it couldn’t be helped that I’ve made ‘''meeting or seeing a legit\xa0geisha''‘\xa0as\xa0an item on the very top of my bucket list.''Well…\xa0guess what?''I already made this dream come true when I went to Japan this year!''What have I done, precisely?''I talked to\xa0a geisha in Tokyo over a''dinner banquet'',\xa0I played games with 2 young senior''maiko''in Niigata'', I caught sight of\xa0a legitimate maiko (who was on her way to work) in one of Gion – Kyoto’s narrow alleys, and I watched two young Japanese''maiko''perform in Kyoto’s Gion Corner\xa0— breathtaking experiences that I will surely\xa0remember and treasure forever.''Of course, now that I have met and seen them, my wish for their practices to continue\xa0for''eternity''has been strengthened even more!''But before I go on, actually, let’s talk about the movie again because I find it imperative to\xa0note that since ‘''Memoirs of a Geisha''‘''was made in Hollywood,''it had\xa0several aspects that were false (if not overly romanticized) thereby contributing to the already growing misconceptions of this culture.''Thanks to my discussions with a geisha,''Kimicho''of Tokyo, as well as to my long research sprees,''I have come to learn MORE\xa0of the truth.''…and yep, you guessed it right!''Today, I will be imparting that\xa0knowledge with you so that you too can be cleared of any misconceptions that you may have about them.''.''Understanding the Geisha of Japan''»''What\xa0is a ‘geisha’? How about a ‘maiko’?''A''geisha'',''which translates to English as\xa0“performing artist” or “artisan”, is a high-class professional and traditional female entertainer in Japan trained in various forms of art.''IMPORTANT NOTE'': In west of Japan\xa0such as of that\xa0in Kyoto, they use another name for geisha:''geiko.''Whereas in Kanto area (around Tokyo), they call them''geigi''.\xa0For Tokyo and other places, they commonly use the word ‘geisha’.\xa0For the sake of consistency in this article, I will use the word geisha. Besides, it is a more widely recognized term that can be used to encompass both that of western Japan’s geikos and Tokyo’s geisha.''Meanwhile, a''maiko'',''which translates to English as “dancing child”, is an apprentice geisha.''Historically, a maiko starts her training at a very young age: around 3 or 5 years old. But now, their training starts at a much later date: in Kyoto they start at 15 or 16 and in Tokyo they start at 18.''Nevertheless, any girl\xa0who wants to enter the community does not have to begin as a maiko because it’s said that they can already proceed being a geisha. (Still and the same, they are required to do at least a year’s worth of training before debuting as a geisha.)\xa0For women who are aged 21 to 23 and above, they are deemed to be too old to become maiko so they already become a geisha when they join the community — again, still with\xa0training beforehand.''IMPORTANT NOTE'': In Tokyo, maiko are rather called as''hangyoku''(“half jewel”) and they can remain to be so until they are 23.\xa0For the sake of consistency in this article, I will use the word maiko.''.''I promised\xa0that I will do this ‘''All About You''‘ series every month; however, much like what I expected and much like what you might have come to notice on the blog,\xa0I\xa0became too busy\xa0with my travels and\xa0I ended up forgetting about this''(aaah, sorry)''…\xa0But hey, it’s better late than not to post at all, right?\xa0And so, I’m finally continuing my aim of sharing your letters\xa0as you tell me your\xa0stories of travel,\xa0perseverance, and success''— stories that I have somehow been a part of.''I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again: you guys have been thanking me non-stop, but do know that I’m equally (if not more) thankful for each and everyone of you!''…Do you want to publicize your story too?

When it comes to Finland though, their love for''saunas''resonates all over the world. They are, after all, the country that invented this form of amazing public bath culture.''Back when I''visited Finland for a week'', I was lucky enough to have been able to try and witness a typical Finnish sauna and it was an experience that was not only memorable but refreshing too!''It’s best for you to know by now that unlike how we might see saunas, the Finns DON’T\xa0see it as a luxury — but rather a necessary daily experience\xa0given how\xa0it has become ingrained into their culture and life for years. In fact, when you visit Finland, you will see for yourself how every Finnish residence will have their own private sauna''(studies say that there is on average, 1 sauna in every household).''Hotels will always have it as an ammenity as well, and if you travel around the region, you would even\xa0notice\xa0these small wooden huts\xa0that are either beside a house or near a body of water.''Now if you were ever to pay a visit to the wonderful country of Finland, a trip to a Finnish\xa0sauna is a must! And in order to prepare you for this experience —''since it can be daunting to step into a heated place with strangers and with no clothes on''—\xa0let me share with you some facts and basic know-how.''.''Finnish Sauna''»''The Tradition''It is difficult to trace the exact origins of the Finnish sauna, however, one can surmise that this ‘warming activity’\xa0was born due to the naturally cold climate of the country. (Yet of course, it helps to note that its popularity still remains even in summer!)''What we do know is that the sauna culture\xa0spread out\xa0to other countries when European bathhouses were being destroyed during the Reformation in Scandinavia,\xa0and it remained to flourish in Finland over time because of the great versatility possessed by it.\xa0I say this\xa0because in the olden times, Finns can live in a sauna: they can make food on the stove, cure their meat, take care of their hygiene\xa0with\xa0it, and even give birth in it (as it is regarded as a sterile environment). Because of this fact, Finns would customarily build a sauna first whenever they moved!''Today, Finns take a sauna for at least once a week as they regard it as a place for physical and mental healing. Truth be told, they have a saying that while one is in a sauna, one must conduct (behave) himself as one would in church. Yep, it’s''that''“sacred”.''And their attachment to it perfectly shows when it comes to\xa0vacations and getaways because you could see Finnish families dragging along their mobile/portable saunas, if not seek\xa0out a sauna place while abroad. Though, if in case\xa0a person or family doesn’t have a private sauna in their home, it’s common for Finns to go to a shared public one.''Now, as a visitor to the country, if\xa0you ever get invited to a Finnish\xa0sauna, it’s best''NOT''to refuse. Of course you''can''refuse but it might disappoint your Finnish host(s) because such an invitation signifies their acceptance of you\xa0— it’s an honor, per se. So should you ever decline, you better have a good reason for it!''»''Different Sauna Types''There are various types of saunas in Finland and they can be categorized by the building or by the stove it uses.''Primarily however, there are the types below:''Smoke Sauna''(Savusauna)''.''This is a Finnish sauna that has no chimney. Wood is burned in a large stove in order to fill the room with smoke. The fire is slowly permitted to die when the sauna becomes hot enough, and thereafter, the smoke is slowly ventilated.''Wood Stove Sauna.''This is the most common type of Finnish sauna found outside of the city. It uses a metal stove with stones on top (''kiuas'') that are heated by wood fire. With this kind, the use of birch wood is preferred for its good quality and smell, and the person would typically sit on a high bench near the ceiling where the hot steam would reach them quickly.\xa0The vital thing about this kind of sauna is to achieve a good''löyly''— the state when the stones are hot enough so that you can throw water at it in order for the steam to rise.''Electric Sauna.''As the name suggests, this kind of sauna does not require wood to burn. It mainly uses stones that are heated ‘''electronically''‘ at a push of a button, and which would produce steam whenever you throw water on it.''»''How to Sauna''Here is a helpful ‘rough’ guide of how you should have a sauna bath in a public Finnish sauna (which applies for all other kinds of sauna all over the world, even private ones too). For sure, there are instructions available in the sauna place itself, but it helps to know how the sauna process goes beforehand, right?''1.''Drink 1-2 glasses or a bottle of water 30 minutes to an hour before you get into a sauna.''.''2.''Take off all your clothes, and then take a shower in order to remove any oils or dirt from your body. (Some Finns would already take a dip in a cold lake at this point!)''I know how weird it must feel for you to get into a public sauna with strangers''without''your clothes on. I assure you though that\xa0the Finns regard this as normal (much like how Japanese people in onsens do their bathing\xa0routine\xa0in the nude). So yes, there’s no ‘sexual’ context in this. If in case, you really can’t do it, you can always cover yourself up in a towel during your sauna experience; the Finns would understand, but of course, it’s best that you take off that towel once you’re in the sauna ;)''.''3.''Before entering the sauna, grab a towel which is sometimes available for free or for rent. (Some\xa0people enter the sauna with wet skin, while others don’t — it depends on you.)''.''4.''Once inside, you will see that there are benches along the walls. The top ones are hottest, and the lower ones are coolest. As a first timer, it’s best to opt for\xa0the middle benches — you can move up or down later on as you gauge your tolerance for the heat.\xa0Spread out your towel on the spot you picked and sit on it (this is for hygiene reasons, and also because the bench can get very warm).''.''5.''You will notice that breathing inside the sauna feels a bit awkward. Don’t worry, this is normal. Now, while you are sitting in your spot, some people will pour water over the hot stones which will give rise to steam. This will be very warm at first, but you won’t be burned. If you like the feeling though, don’t hold back: feel free to pour water on the rocks as often as you’d like.''.''6.''After 8-10 minutes of sweating, get out and take a cold shower. The maximum time you can stay in is 15 minutes; but feel free to get out sooner if you don’t feel comfortable.''Apart from taking a cold shower, you can do it like the Finns do in order to get an incredible ‘rush’: jump into a cold lake (or during winter, it’s called ice swimming where they cut a hole through the ice; otherwise, you can\xa0roll in the snow!)''.''7.''Cool off somewhere for 10 minutes and\xa0drink something.''.''8.''Go back into the sauna and warm yourself again (maximum 15 minutes). At this point, you can try the Finnish''vihta''on your shoulders since your skin is smoother than when you first came in.\xa0(This is a bunch of leafy fragrant birch. Finns\xa0gently use this to beat themselves as it is said to help relax the muscles and improve circulation.)''.''9.''Repeat this sweating and cooling off process for as many times as you want! Some Finns can take hours inside the sauna,\xa0but since you’re new to this, do\xa0STOP when you start to feel dizzy.''.''10.''End your sauna with a shower and let your body cool down.''»''Other Tips and Facts''Apart from the tips that I’ve already mentioned above, here are some other things you should know:''To be clear, yes, saunas are taken in the nude by the Finns. But again: it’s all non-sexual and public saunas have separate sections for men and women.''Always remember\xa0to keep your body hydrated during your sauna session; however,\xa0alcohol is surely something you should avoid! In most public saunas by the way, you’re free to bring your own drinks if you want.''Authentic Finnish saunas are often dimly lit. There\xa0are\xa0no music or fragrances added except for the fresh smell of birch, pure steam or natural tar.''It’s always great\xa0to go into a public sauna with a local — so make sure you say\xa0YES if they ever invite you! On the other hand, just bring your friends with you and enjoy your time there as you socialize. You’ll see it for yourself: the scene inside a sauna is like a ‘cafe’ — less the coffee and food, but more casual chatter and whatnot.''In the end, there really are no strict rules to using a sauna since\xa0how you use it can change depending on any occasion. What’s ultimately important is that you get to relax and even socialise especially if you stepped in with other people (Finns or non-Finns alike).''»''Where To Find Saunas?''With literally MILLIONS of them spread out across Finland, you’re bound to see one, if not be lead to one. Like I’ve previously stated, not only does almost every household have a private Finnish sauna but hotels and corporate places have it — it’s''that''abundant. So for sure, if you step into a city, you can either use the hotel’s sauna facilities or simply ask for the local public sauna’s location.''And if you’re ever in''Helsinki'', I suggest going to''Sauna Hermanni'',''one of the 3 remaining public saunas in the city that dates back to the 50s and even looks like it’s stuck in the 50s!\xa0For only 10EUR for adults, 8EUR for students and 3EUR for kids, you can enjoy their quality\xa0IKI-Kiuas\xa0stoves as well as their mellow ambient that will take you to a trip back in time.''.''Overall''If you’re looking for an everyday carry that isn’t too big nor too heavy and which does not sacrifice overall style, I suggest that you consider\xa0the newest''Bomber Barrel Duffel Bag''that made waves on Kickstarter not too long ago!''You see, this has become my\xa0favorite\xa0carry-on\xa0for months now whenever I go to the gym, as well as\xa0when I go to short weekender trips to the beach, forest, or whatnot.''I could have certainly chosen\xa0my other bags for these kinds of occasions, but the reason why I kept on preferring\xa0the Bomber Barrel Duffel Bag from the rest is because it can take on a ‘beating’ from the elements''(''dirt, water, rain, etc)''while also keeping\xa0my packing efforts compact and small.''.''Bomber Barrel Duffel Bag''»''Why I love it!''It’s voted the best duffle bag for a reason — it’s a premium functional item made of great materials!''When you purchase the Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag, it not only comes with the signature duffle bag itself, but it also comes along with a free Bomber Travel Kit to hold your other essentials.''To illustrate its features…''The whole of the duffle bag is made of ultra high quality weather-resistant N4004-AC2 Nylon 6 ripstop, which means that it is highly resistant not only to the elements but to any tearing or ripping (''goodbye to slasher thieves!).''There are inner and outer pockets for smaller essentials where you can store your keys, cards, phone, etc.''The zippers are water-proof. I even tried puncturing the zippers\xa0with a pen to see if I can push my way in, but it proved to be very difficult — which is good news for us!''It’s neither too large nor too small at a dimension of: 18″x10″x10″\xa0which makes it\xa0a perfect carry on or\xa0a weekender getaway bag! In fact, it’s so lightweight at only 390 grams.''It’s a comfortable carry given how\xa0it possesses an adjustable leather-padded quick-release shoulder strap, as well as handles with padded velcro grip.''For emergencies, you’re assured of the included military-grade clips and paracord zipper pulls.''.''It’s dynamic: it’s designed for use by an\xa0athlete, an\xa0adventurer, a\xa0professional, and a\xa0minimalist!''Given the overall design and “look” of the Bomber Barrel Duffel Bag, it’s a great companion\xa0for various adventures and occasions — a minimal but stylish ‘all-around carry’ per se that is unlike most traditional duffel bags!''Besides, no matter if its a daily affair or a classy set-up, this bag can answer to whatever needs you may have.''.''Overall''Snow failed to visit Belgium (my current home base)\xa0last winter, and that was a huge letdown for me…\xa0So when the tourism board of Helsinki invited me to stay for a week\xa0in their wonderful city during the “white” month of February, it wasn’t hard to say YES! (And like what I’ve already discussed in''my previous posts'', I was given the chance to bring a +1 too and it was Jonas who I decided to bring along.)''Right then and there,\xa0I\xa0started daydreaming about\xa0all the possible things that we would be doing… but\xa0when\xa0I asked about our itinerary, the tourism board\xa0said that it was a ‘secret’\xa0and that\xa0we would know why once we\xa0get there.\xa0For sure, it was a crafty way for building suspense in the both of us.''22nd of February''— we landed in Helsinki, and\xa0my contact person, a wonderful woman named Elizabeth, finally divulged why they didn’t give\xa0us\xa0a travel plan at the start. Apparently,\xa0it was\xa0because they have been amassing a lot of sponsors up until our arrival, and with the pack of free tickets that they\xa0have acquired for us, we can then have the freedom to plot our own week-long itinerary!''Elizabeth slowly sprawled out all these ‘goodies’ on our apartment’s\xa0table —''invitations from various attractions, tour providers, and restaurants all throughout the city''— and I couldn’t help but feel that it was Christmas all over again!''You bet that Jonas and I had a tough\xa0time plotting our activities at first (there were just far too many awesome things to do!). \xa0In the end though, we managed to squeeze all the top things that we desired for our 7-day stay. Here’s how it went for us:''.''Helsinki''»''Day 1''After our 2-hour flight, Elizabeth ushered us into our Helsinki Secret Residence for the week: an''Aallonkoti''apartment that was located in the heart\xa0of the city.''It was\xa0easy\xa0to fall in love with this space because though the room was modernly furnished with a touch of an artistic ‘quirk’, it still retained the coziness and warmth of “home”. In fact, Jonas immediately settled in on the bed!''I especially loved how there is a huge balcony as well that gave us a clear view of the city skyline that was wrapped in white velvet snow; so whilst Jonas drifted off to a peaceful nap on the bed, I spent some time resting in the balcony as I savored how lucky\xa0I was to have been able to start off my Helsinki trip on a great note!''Once Jonas woke up, we proceeded to plot our itinerary for the next days as we joyfully flipped through all the tickets that Elizabeth has given us. Since it was already night time at this point, we decided to take a leisurely stroll around the city as we go off and\xa0grab dinner in one of the restaurants who wanted to offer us complimentary meals. We felt like eating ‘comfort food’ and so we picked a restaurant called: Naughty BRGR… and OMG their burgers and fries were divine!!!''A lot of Finnish people were also crowding up this place so it really seemed like one of those places that locals frequent to. If I have to give you a tip, make sure that you order their sweet potato fries because these were sinfully good.''After our hearty meal, we proceeded to stroll around the city during the night and we were absolutely blown away by how picturesque and ‘''hip''‘ Helsinki was.''In all honesty, we expected it to be olden; and though it still has its old infrastructure, it was easy to see how the metropolis has such a unique and energetic vibe what with all the modern architectural wonders, cafe culture, and bustling crowd.''We were definitely off to a good start!''•\xa0•\xa0•''»''Day 2''Since Jonas and I are outdoor buffs, our agenda for the day was to go and hike through the area of''Nuuksio.''The Helsinki tourism board provided us with thick parkas for the whole of our stay and it was a sure life saver for the cold!''We took an hour-long bus first to''Haltia Nature Centre''where we got to learn more about the flora and fauna not only in Helsinki but the whole of Finland.''We learned here that\xa0the north of Finland\xa0which is above the Arctic Circle usually doesn’t have any sun (only a few hours of twilight around noon) for a month or more during winter. It’s typically referred to as a polar knight in which the Finns call it as ‘''kaamos''‘. (I seriously can’t imagine having no sun for months!)''Once we had our fill of information, we sought out a nearby hiking trail. The staff at the nature center told us that there was one that passes through''Lake Pitkajarvi.''As we set off on this adventure, every step I took in the snow made me realize how I might actually prefer hiking during winter instead of the other seasons, because the surroundings looked incredibly magical and mystifying — and best of all: I don’t sweat!''In our trail, we chanced upon a spot\xa0where several other hikers were eating or taking up some warmth from a fire. Later on, we even found a lodge by the side of the road that we savored for ourselves!''At one point however, we ended up walking in the wrong direction. Our trail was supposed to be on the other side of the road over the thicket of trees, and so Jonas had an idea that we can just traverse through it in order to end up on our desired trail. It sounded like a brilliant plan — but as we walked through it, we couldn’t help but start laughing because we failed to take into account that there would be tons of fresh snow piled up. So imagine, every step we took would make our feet plunge right through the ice and the effort it took to move my feet felt like I was threading through water! In short: it was a bit tiring.''Thankfully, we managed to go through and get on the right trail. Jonas and I agreed that though it was fun and ‘adventurous’, we should never\xa0do that again.''*laughs*''Right before our trail ended, we made it to a viewing platform which gave us a great view over the lake, and we surely took our time savoring the picturesque landscape. It was really spectacular and as I stood there, I distinctly felt how I was\xa0slowly falling in love with Helsinki.''Afterwards, we headed off to our bus stop and it was here that I suddenly remembered how I have never built my own snowman yet! I took advantage of this ‘free time’ as I proceeded to build a small\xa0white guy — isn’t he adorable?!''Come night time, we headed off to dinner to Kappeli\xa0in order to try Finnish dishes. This restaurant was conveniently located in one of the big parks in the city and it was an elegant establishment. Jonas and I both ordered a classic''tattikuorrutettua''or reindeer fillet and it was a superb dish with a very gamey taste. (I was a bit apprehensive at first of eating reindeer meat; but I thought, once should be enough! I’m glad nonetheless that I tried it.)''To cap the night off perfectly, we went on\xa0to try a typical Finnish sauna experience.''DID YOU KNOW''?''Finns\xa0have an\xa0immense love for saunas! It has become a substantial part of their culture — NOT as a luxury but more of a necessity. So it’s a must-do should you ever head to\xa0Finland. Apart from private saunas that are located in hotels and apartments, there are also public saunas spread out across the country.''•\xa0•\xa0•''»''Day 3''This was supposed to be the day that Jonas and I would head on to a snowmobile safari; but overnight, he developed a fever so we had to reschedule it on the 5th day. Jonas actually urged me to just go alone because he said that he can take care of himself, but I refused because not only did I want to share this experience with him but I also knew that he wanted to try this out for himself. He was clearly being considerate since he doesn’t want to mess up our itinerary. I assured him however that it was fine; I can transfer some of my planned activities to this day as I tour the city by myself\xa0(but first,\xa0I went off to buy some food and medicines for him.)''After I dropped everything off at the apartment and made sure that Jonas was comfortable, I went off to tour the town. I visited places like the''Rock Church (Temppeliaukio Church), Sibelius Park, and the Finnish Museum of Natural History.''» READ:''Top 10 FREE Things To Do in Helsinki, Finland''Come afternoon, I went on to Radio Helsinki to be interviewed about my experience in the city — YES. You read that right! I did\xa0a radio interview and it was my''FIRST''time''to do such a thing. It was even done LIVE and you cannot imagine how nervous I was! I was pretty sure that I was going to trip over my words or say something incredibly stupid on air.''The Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania)''in northern\xa0Europe are, for me, a fascinating trio.''Not a lot of travelers would normally put\xa0these countries in\xa0their first ‘Eurotrip’ itinerary —''because they’re\xa0not as ‘established’\xa0like Paris or Amsterdam''— and yet, a\xa0lot of the well-known frequent\xa0travelers that I know of would sing nothing but glorious praises for these\xa0off-the-beaten-path destinations, while they continue to recommend them\xa0in a heartbeat.''Which leads me to conclude that though the Baltic states are some of the''least-visited countries\xa0in Europe'', they are true-blue hidden gems in their own right. My traveler friends’\xa0testimonials not only prove this\xa0fact but the images and articles that I have seen online have as well; and boy,\xa0I kid you not, these places all looked absolutely gorgeous and “untouched”!''So when I\xa0had\xa0the chance to explore Estonia during one of the days that I was in''Helsinki'', I did NOT\xa0hesitate to book\xa0a ticket …And guess what? I may have only spent a day there but it was enough to show me that the\xa0people and the pictures\xa0didn’t lie. Besides, Tallinn\xa0(the capital of Estonia), was a city that looked like it came\xa0straight out of a fairytale!''You bet that I am aiming to see more of Estonia in the future, as well as the other two Baltic countries. If I may say so as well,\xa0I am ecstatic\xa0 that I was able to see this enchanting place before\xa0it becomes too touristic (given how “our” praises would soon reach everybody’s ears! *wink*)''With that in mind, I absolutely recommend spending your European vacation in Tallinn. After all, if you’re already visiting Helsinki in Finland, you can easily reach it in a matter of 2 hours!''.''Tallinn''»''How to\xa0get to Tallinn from Helsinki?''There are several cruise lines that travel from Helsinki to Tallinn everyday, and the prices across all these providers don’t differ as much. For my case, I opted to go with''Tallink Silja Line''because not only were they reasonably-priced''(starts at €18 for 1-way)'', but they were also filled with versatile onboard services! (They’re the leading operator across the Baltic Seas for a reason.)''Rest assured, if you plan to make a day trip to Tallinn, the ferry line does 7 trips daily from each port; so for my case, it was easy for me to book a seat at around 8AM to Tallinn and then go back to Helsinki come 7PM.''At the moment, they have 3 modern ships that do the Helsinki-Tallinn route, namely:''the M/S Star, M/S Superstar, and M/S Baltic Qeeen''.''There are 3 seat categories that you can choose from as well (apart from the cabins) and they are:''Star Class:''unnumbered seats which means that you can choose how to spend your time during the journey —\xa0inside, outside the deck, at one of the many restaurants inside the ship, in the duty-free shops, etc.''Star Comfort Class:''an upgrade that offers you bigger and more comfortable seating spaces that comes along with extra services like a snack buffet! There is also WiFi as well as TVs to keep you entertained.''Business Class:''the highest luxury to your cruise trip! It also comes with free WiFi, tax-free menu, newspapers, and business lounge buffet.''I booked myself into Star Comfort Class because I\xa0thought that it would be worth the added cost''— and it was!''In fact, this area kind of functioned like my personal cabin because during the trip back to Helsinki, I managed to have a whole big couch to myself as\xa0I dozed off.''Otherwise, the main airport will be Tallinn Airport located 5km from the city center.''»''What to see and do in Tallinn?''Right from the moment that I stepped foot in Tallinn, I could instantly see its striking difference from Helsinki. You see… if\xa0Helsinki gave me the general impression of “chic and modern”, Tallinn on the other hand exuded “medieval mystic”. That being said, it was quite a refreshing change of ‘pace’.''Armed with a map, Jonas and I decided to ditch it after a few minutes especially after seeing how Tallinn’s center can be easily reached and explored on foot.''For the things that you shouldn’t miss…?''#1 – Old Town.''This is an astonishingly well-preserved medieval town that was listed in 1997 on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Since joining European union in 2004, Slovakia’s currency is\xa0the Euro, and we have everything from unique castles, caves, mountains, hot springs, folk architecture and more.''Without further ado, read on below about the 10\xa0interesting things about Slovakia:''.''10 Things Foreigners Should Know About\xa0Slovakia''#1:''Slovakia is in Central Europe\xa0— it’s NOT Slovenia''Slovakia is such a small country that only very few people actually knew where it is after asking me where I’m from. Trying to help them place my home country on a map doesn’t help when I try to explain that Slovakia is located in Central Europe. There are so many definitions of Central and Eastern Europe, that it really depends on the source you are using whether you find Slovakia in Central or Eastern Europe.''And yet this is not the only common misunderstanding from\xa0foreigners. They also confuse it with Slovenia. Even George W. Bush and many other politicians have mistakenly talked about Slovakia and Slovenia. It resulted in regular monthly meetings of staff from Slovak and Slovenian embassies to exchange wrongly-addressed mail.''#2:''Has great national parks with diverse nature''With 9 national parks and 14 protected landscape areas, there is a lot to choose from when visiting Slovakia. Most of them are located in central part of the country, and the best part is you can visit them by using public transport!\xa0The best known park is the High Tatras with peaks over 2500m, and it is a popular place for hiking and skiing.''Meanwhile, Slovak Paradise is popular for exploring the caves; whereas Low Tatras is the largest national park full of mountains and green valleys\xa0—\xa0our favourite for mountain biking.''#3:''We’ve got interesting folk dances''One of the most interesting things about Slovakia are Slovak folk dances. Influenced by the region and a way of living, dances and folk costumes are different and colorful. In fact, there are more than a hundred folk groups in Slovakia and the dances are brisk, full of temperament and accompanied mostly by cymbalo, violin and bass.''Maya is a former folk dancer and used to dance in a folk group. Many folk performances are held at the festivals around and during summer. See yourself how beautiful and unique our folk art is in''this video''.''#4:''More than 1,600 mineral springs''There are more than 1,600 officially registered springs, many of them used as a source of mineral drinking water and the others are thermal springs for relaxing spas. You can buy bottled water from Slovak springs in every store – each type has a different benefits for your body. The biggest area for swimming is in Bešeňová, where 33 springs can be found.''The world rarity are hot springs in Podhájska – the water is said to have more beneficial effects than the famous Dead Sea water.''#5:''The most castles and chateaux per capita in the world''Photo by''Marian Hubinsky''/ CC''Slovakia has 180 castles and 425 chateaux – huge numbers for a small country! So wherever you go, you will see at least one castle or chateaux. The most popular of them all is Spiš Castle, which is also one of the largest in Central Europe\xa0(it is included in the UNESCO List of World’s Cultural and Natural Heritage).''For us though, the most beautiful castle is from our hometown of Trencin (pictured above).''#6:''First folk architecture reservation in the world''Photo by''Petra Gregorová''/ CC''The picturesque village of Čičmany is located near Strážov Hills in northern Slovakia. It is the first-ever folk architecture reservation in the world\xa0and the 1st\xa0mention of the village dates back to the year 1272! There are\xa0more than 130 houses that belong\xa0to this area\xa0and the wooden houses are painted with different folk ornaments, some of them appearing on the people’s folk costumes.''#7:''We have more than 6,000 caves''More than six thousand caves have been discovered in Slovakia. Most of them can be found in the national parks of Low Tatras, Slovak Paradise and Slovak Karst, and they truly are unique natural wonders.''For instance, Ochtinska Aragonite Cave is called “freak of nature”. Instead of classic stalagmites and stalactites, you will find white aragonite twigs and bushes. Did you know? There are only four accessible aragonite caves in the world, rest of them are in Czech Republic, Mexico and Argentina.''#8:''Similar language to other European countries''Slovak language belongs to the Slavic language family. It is sometimes called “Slovak Esperanto” because it is the most comprehensible language for the speakers of other Slavic languages.''Truth be told, we understand each other with people from different European countries speaking Slavic languages – such as Czech, Polish, Russian, Croatian and others''#9:''The oldest European marathon''Photo by''EHRENBERG Kommunikation''/ CC''Kosice Peace Marathon is the oldest marathon in Europe and the world’s second oldest (after Boston Marathon). It is held every year in Kosice, in the eastern part of Slovakia, on the first Sunday in October.''#10:''A special (smelly) but tasty cheese''Photo by''Julie Putseys''/ CC''Slovakia’s national dish is called “Bryndzové halušky”. They are potato dumplings with a special kind of fermented sheep cheese called “bryndza”.''It is best prepared with pieces of fried bacon on top! This is a very unique and popular meal which can be found in most of the restaurants. Quality varies so make sure to check beforehand the best place to get bryndzové halušky.''.''Overall''When I made a brief trip to the''Philippines''last April\xa0to visit family and friends, I encountered a small dilemma:''“Where am I going to stay?”''Of course the natural response would be:''“At my parent’s house!”''Regrettably however, my folks’ house is way far from the city center of Manila! In order to enjoy my trip to the fullest, it was best for me to base myself in Makati so that I can easily meet up not only with my family but with friends too.''I was only going to be there for less than a week — tops — that’s why\xa0time was crucial. After all, I didn’t mind shelling out extra money in order to get\xa0my own place that’s near to ‘everything’.''So since Makati was ultimately the ‘place to be’ for me, my dilemma was swiftly erased\xa0and that’s because it was absolutely easy to think of the best accommodation for me! Where else but at''Dusit Thani Manila''?''– HOTEL & SERVICE\xa0–''Prime Location.''Towering beside Ayala Station in Edsa, this upscale hotel is just minutes away from some of the top 4 malls in the metro, namely: SM Makati, Glorietta, Landmark, and Greenbelt. Given this fact, you’re surely surrounded by a lot of options that can keep you entertained, fulfilled, and refreshed.''Besides, Dusit Thani is smacked\xa0right in the heart of the capital’s\xa0major financial, commercial and economic hub which is Makati. Needless to say and like what I’ve already mentioned above, you’re going to be absolutely near to almost ‘''everything''‘ that you might ever need during your stay.''Exquisite Furnishings.''Dusit Thani is at its core a Thai-themed hotel and from the moment that I stepped into their lobby, I was greeted with big smiles by their staff who were clad in traditional clothing — which was quite a sight! This was followed by an astonishing golden display of their lobby which made perfect harmony of old and modern elements. Right then and there… I knew that I was in for a treat!''Superb Service Like No Other.''This is the part where I knew that I made a great choice by booking myself into\xa0Dusit Thani.''When I\xa0checked in, I was a\xa0tad too early; but they were hospitable enough in doing their best in finding a room for me and making their cleaning staff tidy it all up asap. Unfortunately though, disaster stroke when I got into my room because it reeked of cigarette\xa0smoke!''It was so bad… so I was\xa0immensely disappointed as I went back downstairs to the lobby to inform them of the mishap.\xa0(At that time,\xa0I was starting to think that I’ve probably made the wrong hotel choice.)''I was calm and collected as I explained to them the condition of my room; however, the staff weren’t. They were so anxious and apologetic! Now it took a while before I was finally placed into a new room. Naturally, I was still disappointed — until… the girl before me mentioned the word ‘''upgraded''‘.''She didn’t exactly say what upgrade I got, so in my mind I was all: “''It could be one level up like an\xa0executive room.\xa0It doesn’t matter really as\xa0long as it doesn’t smell bad.''”''But ‘lo and behold ladies and gentlemen… when I stuck in my keys and entered my designated room, I was floored:''they gave me a spacious executive suite!!!''Every fiber of my being felt like running back to the lobby and hugging the staff person that assisted me because what was displayed before was more than enough of a ‘sorry’! Truth be told, this was my first ever upgrade and my first ever suite, so you can imagine how ecstatic\xa0I was — more so because this was truly a kind of service that made up for the hassle that I was initially put through.''Dusit Thani Manila, you guys are simply amazing and I definitely don’t regret picking you because I have clearly made\xa0the right choice! ;)''.''The''first time that I experienced snow''— which was just 2 years ago — I was in complete and utter\xa0bliss.''But for as soon as that happiness came,\xa0a huge wave of sadness overwhelmed me when\xa0I realized\xa0how\xa0us ‘tropics\xa0people’ have been missing out on such a magical thing for the majority of our lives:''the change of the seasons.''…Still and the same, that didn’t keep my spirits down for long. As we all say,''it’s better late than never.''That’s why\xa0from that point onwards, I made it a point to simply enjoy the wintry seasons and to try as much winter activities as I could. So when Visit Helsinki invited me over to their''#HelsinkiSecret''residence last\xa0February, you could imagine how incredibly elated\xa0I was!\xa0Besides, one of the activities that they offered was an amazing snowmobile safari with''Burn Out City Events''.''I was even\xa0given the opportunity to bring along a +1. Naturally, I brought Jonas along. We initially scheduled our snowmobile experience on the\xa03rd day; however, Jonas was suddenly struck by fever. The guys over at Burn Out City Events were very\xa0understanding and they let me reschedule it on the 5th day.''(Those guys are tops!)''In all actuality, I could have done this winter experience alone, and Jonas himself urged me to just go since he felt bad for delaying things; however,\xa0I really wanted to share this\xa0with him\xa0— besides, happiness is best when shared, right?''So: I did my best to nurse Jonas back to health. End result? We managed to do the snowmobile safari experience on the 5th day! And how did it go, you ask?''…Astonishingly\xa0epic.''Plus,\xa0I’m glad that I have been able to share this experience with my best friend.''.''My First Snowmobile Safari Experience''At 9AM, we\xa0were picked up from our apartment hotel in''Aallonkoti''by our contact person from Burn Out City Events.''His name was Henrik and he was a warm and interesting fellow (who, mind you, had a\xa0great Nordic\xa0accent). He told us\xa0that the safaris were arranged in a municipality called''Sipoo''which was just approximately 30km east of Helsinki. It\xa0would\xa0take us half an hour to get there and\xa0I didn’t mind it at all especially because Henrik was great to talk with as he shared a lot of\xa0facts and stories of his life in Helsinki.''Occasionally, he would also happily mention how perfectly “thick” the ice was that day for our snowmobile experience.''The first time that he mentioned this, it quickly\xa0dawned on me the reality of what we were about to be doing soon…\xa0and''that''made me jittery. Besides, I still couldn’t wrap my head around the idea that a layer of hard ice\xa0on top would really\xa0keep us and our heavy snowmobiles from sinking to the bottom of the sea! This might\xa0come as ‘common knowledge’ for you guys\xa0who have experienced winter in your\xa0lives, but not for me, so it was still such a foreign concept.''But alas… my excitement won\xa0over my fears — it always does — so I immediately forgot it in just a minute or two''(remember how I once did''paragliding''over the French Alps even if in fact I have a strong fear of heights? I still do.)''We finally arrived at their center and I noticed how deserted the place was.''“Hey Henrik, where are our safari companions? Are we the first ones to arrive?”''I asked.''“None. You’ll be doing a private session with us!”''Niiiiiice.''This\xa0was news to me — and a good one at that. I really thought we were going with a group, but now that it was just going to be us and ‘them’, I had visions of how amazingly\xa0personalized this safari would be and that made me even more excited!''At this point, Henrik introduced us to our guide who was a cheery lad named Kenneth, and we knew that we would love''“Kenny”''as our companion for the day when he made a South Park reference the moment that he introduced himself.''After a little bit of chit-chat, it was time to change into proper clothes. When it comes to Burn Out City, be assured that you\xa0will never have to worry about bringing the right clothing and gear for this snowmobile safari experience because they will provide everything for you! So yes, you can keep your clothes on you and they will provide the rest:''snowsuit, gloves, balaclava, helmet, and boots''to protect you from the cold and the snow.''Everything comes in different sizes too; therefore, there’s always going\xa0to be a match for you. If I may note, the remarkable\xa0thing about their snowsuit was that it\xa0kept me warm and well even if I was only wearing pants and 1 sweater underneath. Kenny pointed out as well that this snowsuit serves\xa0as a life jacket in case of accidents or emergencies. Like let’s say, worst scenario: the ice breaks and I slip into cold water, he\xa0told us that their snowsuits will not only keep me\xa0dry but it will also\xa0make me''extremely''buoyant. I was told that\xa0one of the common problems of falling into ice\xa0is that it can be quite hard to pull yourself out of the water; but since these suits float up so high, you can easily push yourself out of it and towards safety.''Now this is not to say that we will fall, they never had cases of such\xa0things since\xa0they always make sure that the ice is thick enough for snowmobiling anyway. To prove this point, once Jonas and I were done changing, he took us outside while\xa0he lugged along with him some sort of gigantic metal drill (which I found out later on was called an ‘''ice auger''‘).''I followed him and mindlessly watched as he started drilling through the ice that we were standing on.''…and that’s when it hit me, “''Oh wait. We’re already out in the frozen sea. Holy sh*t, he’s drilling through it. Omg. Will this break the ice we’re standing on?!”''Yep. I think I’ve watched far too many movies. My apologies\xa0again: I’ve never dealt with these wintry things in my life, until that day.''But then\xa0of course everything went well, and when Kenny pulled out the auger, he showed us how thick the ice was that day:''around 30cm!''NOTE'':\xa0As\xa0a general rule, 7cm ice is not advisable to step on, 10cm is fine for fishing/walking/skiing, 12cm is good for a single snowmobile/ATV, 20-30cm is suitable for one car or a group of people, and 30-38cm\xa0can handle\xa0a light truck or van''No doubt about it: it was safe. Clearly, this was a\xa0routine that was done by them to appease any tour participants (like me) who might have some concerns — and it worked, because\xa0my fear did subside\xa0at that point.\xa0Additionally, it\xa0was also great to learn more facts about such things and lessen my ignorance with the help of Kenneth since he was an experienced and knowledgeable guy''(he has been doing this for years and have lived in Helsinki for all his life, anyway).''FYI'': Another one of the things that got me\xa0nervous was that when\xa0I walked on the frozen sea, my feet\xa0would sometimes go\xa0through the\xa0snow and make a squishy sound as if the ice is\xa0already melting and pulling me down to the depths… and when I look at it, they look so wet. (I had ghastly thoughts of\xa0going right through the crack and under the cold sea). Kenny explained to me that that’s because there’s fresh snow on top that’s melting, and that I shouldn’t worry because beneath that is the harder not-so-easy-to-melt 30cm ice that we drilled into.\xa0This was followed by a string of scientific explanations  which made absolute f*cking sense to me, and I just felt a bit foolish for being a bit too paranoid.''Kenny then proceeded to walk over the place where our\xa0snowmobiles were parked\xa0and he started\xa0a brief demo on\xa0how we should be driving it as first-timers. Basically…''If you’ve driven a jetski before''(Jonas and I both have)'', you will find that a basic snowmobile has the same features: an engine starter, an engine stop switch, the\xa0throttle on the right (to pump gas in and make it move forward), and the brake on the left. It’s really that simple!''When it comes to making sharp turns though, it is best to''lean into the turn''that you’re making. This means that if you’re turning right, you must lean your body to the right to make the movement\xa0easier.''Jonas and I decided that it is best if he will be the one that drives the snowmobile for the two of us, while I will handle documentation. (Also because I’m clumsy and I want to increase our chances of survival.)''Nevertheless, I had my chance at\xa0driving\xa0the snowmobile myself\xa0at the latter part of our safari experience and here’s what I’ve learned:''Pushing the throttle might seem scary at first, especially when you hear the gas pumping loud\xa0— but don’t fear, and don’t hold back when pushing it, otherwise… you really won’t move.''When making a turn, don’t be afraid either of leaning towards where you’re heading: left or right. You won’t fall as long as you keep your feet on the snowmobile’s\xa0foot area. (The snowmobile is a big chunk of metal too, so it won’t fall either on you. You just need to lean to make the ride smoother, and to avoid getting stuck as well).''As a beginner, it’s best to ride your snowmobile on trails that have already been traveled in. Venturing out into fresh snow might get you stuck if you’re not experienced enough.\xa0Typically however, Kenny or any other Burn Out City Events’ guide will be riding ahead of\xa0you on the trail, so you will only need to follow them.''TRIVIA'':''Burn Out City Events\xa0uses Yamaha Venture Lite 2013 snowmobiles in their\xa0snowmobile tours. These are specially made for safaris and are equipped with fully automatic engines, which make them nice and easy to drive. They may be\xa0powerful, but they are environmental friendly due to low fuel consumption — a fact that was nice to know!''.''Bucket list''noun''informal''– a list of things a person wants to achieve or experience before reaching a certain age or before dying.''(Source: dictionary.com)''A year\xa0ago, I shared with you my''travel bucket list''for the top 3''destinations''that I’d like to see before I die.

You could absolutely use them for storing your cables, plugs, adaptor, and so much more. Besides, even if you’re not traveling, you can use these cubes at home too for organizing items in your closet.''.''Compressible''– like I’ve already mentioned, packing cubes can help give you more space in your luggage and that’s because you can easily squeeze lots of items in just one cube. Think of it as a mini-luggage: you know\xa0how we can often compress more stuff\xa0in a luggage by sitting on it and zipping it up? Well, eBags packing cubes function in that\xa0same way: fill it to the brim, squeeze, and zip! Stack it all together and you’ll see how much you have managed to pack so much.''.''Well-Organized''– the fact that it comes in different colors and sizes with a visible mesh top means that you can easily find things right away''(e.g.: store your sweaters in a medium red cube, pants in a large blue cube, dirty laundry in a small orange cube, etc.).''Just imagine\xa0how much time you’re saving by knowing exactly where certain clothing types are in so that you wouldn’t have\xa0to turn your suitcase inside out! Also, you can even\xa0easily assign cubes to your travel companions when you’re not traveling alone''(e.g. such as traveling with your partner, your friends or family)''.''.''Efficient''– for whatever occassion. When it comes to short trips that may involve hopping from one place to another, I can simply sort my outfits in each cube and then just pull them out when I need them. As for\xa0long-term stays,\xa0I can just put my packing cubes in the drawers of my hotel or AirBnB without worrying so much about cleaning the shelves for instance. It’s very nifty!''.''They are\xa0quality made!''Long-lasting and durable, eBags are made of premium materials. For one thing, the material of their packing cubes are made of soft breathable + lightweight nylon\xa0so that it won’t damage any kind of fabric — it is collapsible as well and not rigid so it’s perfect for stacking things up.\xa0The interior seams are also snag-free,\xa0and the mesh top was placed not only for easy content identification but for proper ventilation too!''Now one problem that I’ve encountered with some packing cubes is that the zippers can wear out easily. Reest assured, such is not the case with eBags because their packing cubes are designed with premium self-repairing YKK® RC coil zippers ensure a lifetime of opening and closing.''NOTE'': When it comes to maintenance, cleaning the packing cubes are easy. Just zip them close, wash in cold water on a gentle cycle, line-dry, and you’re done!

Today, it hosts national and international sports and outdoor concert events. One of the cool\xa0things about this is its ‘Stadium Tower’ that risees 72 meters high.

Sometimes these tours involve hasty drive-by sightings via climate-controlled motor coaches, or perhaps hours and hours spent walking from one place to another… a truly exhausting experience.''So what’s missing on these city tours? While you’re covering all the sights the guidebooks claim to be the “most-visited”, are you really getting up-close-and-personal with the people of the city and the human factor that drives it? Usually not.''In most cases, you’re also missing the true culture of the city, which isn’t simply a museum with a long line, or a crowded fountain surrounded by starry-eyed wish makers.''Consider Florence, for example.''.''Florence''The birthplace of the Renaissance, Florence is truly one of Italy’s most magnificent cities. And, yes, there are plenty of must-sees and must-dos for you to experience as you make your way through the gateway to Tuscany, including museums like the Academia and Uffizi Galleries, or spots like the Ponte Vecchio. However, the David sculpture by Michelangelo deserves more than just a casual glance. The Tuscan culinary scene means more than a dish of pasta at a tourist-grade restaurant. And Florence’s rich musical history demands at least an hour or two spent listening to the city’s superb virtuosos.''So, where can you find a tour that’s a bit out of the ordinary, one that brings you “behind-the-scenes”, so to speak, or truly immerses you in the culture of the city, its history, its people?''You’ll find all those things – and more – with a tour company that’s dedicated to providing visitors with a look at each city’s best offerings.

Instead, it offers true immersion experiences for you and your companion(s). In Florence, for example, you and a friend can indulge in a full-day Perfume Tour for two, which includes a visit to a 13th century pharmacy founded by the Dominican friars, where you can get a chance to meet a perfume maker and even design your own signature fragrance.''Or perhaps you’d prefer a Michelangelo-centered art tour which is a unique opportunity for you to visit the locations where the famed artist left his mark, including the Accademia Gallery and the Opera del Duomo. You’ll visit places not open to the general public and even participate in a 3-hour sculpture workshop.

Besides, it was through my online work that I was truly able to compete with my global peers and avoid being paid “developing-world salary”''(e.g. my first online job paid me double than what I was earning in my office work; a number that I wouldn’t have earned even if I were to be promoted twice).''Now, ‘working online’ can be such a vague statement, so to be more precise about what I did:''April 2013'':''This was the month\xa0that I quit my job in the investment bank that I previously worked for. My total life savings at that time was probably just around $600 or Php 30K… which was pathetic since I was already working for them for over 2 years! That really aggravated me because no matter how I was leading a frugal life, I can’t seem to save more. (I was paid only $300 or Php 15K a month anyway, so that was expected.) When I talked to them about quitting, my job tried to make me stay by offering a promotion with an increased final salary of $380+ or Php 20K — I almost scoffed when they told me that.''For all the contributions that I was putting into the team (even being awarded as the ‘Employee of the Month’ because of all of what I did), I still remained to be the most underpaid employee in our department — just because I was a fresh graduate. THAT kind of system was really frustrating for me. So… I quit. I told myself: “ENOUGH.” I believed that my time and effort could be better rewarded someplace else; and such was true.''Months before I left the company though, I did all the necessary\xa0steps to prepare myself for the digital nomad life: I looked for online jobs WHILE I was still working in the office (so I was practically doing 2 jobs at once) as I did graphic design, web design, SEO, and marketing — skills that were all''self-learned''(I didn’t learn these in school anyway since I held a business degree).''It was only when I scored a stable online employer — who was willing to employ me for an indefinite amount of time and who paid more than double of what I was earning — that I handed in my resignation because by then, I was secured of the fact that I will have a steady stream of cashflow after I quit.\xa0(See how the online realm can pay more for as long as you have the skills and that you can ‘deliver’?). That employer was a Swedish online brand and I first started as their Customer Service Staff. After a while, I advanced to being their Product Line Supervisor and eventually their Head Marketing and\xa0Social Media Manager (my pay increased\xa0after every ‘promotion’).''While I was working for that Swedish brand, I was also still working on other projects on the side so that I can further earn and save money. Such was my daily grind and it was vicious; nevertheless, it was something that I loved doing and which I was passionate about.''(If you want to see samples of my past work, you can go to my''portfolio page'').''TRIVIA'': As you may know, I quit my job at the age of 21. Some people\xa0said that I didn’t have enough office experience to just suddenly declare that the corporate life didn’t fit me… but that’s only because they assumed that I only started working at 21. Like I’ve mentioned, I’ve already worked for them for 2 years and I even had a previous 1 year experience (I finished my 4-year business degree in university at the''age of 19''and that course enabled me to go through 3 different internships in 3 different multinational companies for a year).''At the same year that I graduated —''still at the age of 19''— I snagged the job at thee said investment bank.

With that in mind,\xa0it also functioned as an important protection for long-distance merchants that are en route to Poland.''Late 13th century and onwards:''Various constructions and further fortifications were made, and\xa0the castle was built in several stages, later on forming 3 separate parts that are erected on different levels of the rocky hill:''Lower, Middle, and Upper levels.''Late 15th century:''After the death of the former head of the county, John of Dubovec, his heirs began to quarrel over the inheritance\xa0— and the situation\xa0was so bad that castle became a store-house. Eventually, it was paid for by a mine-owner named''Ference Thurzo''who was regarded as a wealthy noble. Upon his acquisition, he and the rest of the Turzo family members (like his son György) made further modifications and fortifications to Orava Castle in which they put up\xa0defensive, administrative and residential buildings representing different building styles like:\xa0Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Romanticism.

Getting tons of questions everyday about Tokyo such as “Where to go?”, “Where to stay?” or even more specific ones like, “How to get tickets for Ghibli museum?” has sparked their interest to launch the Our Kawaii Tokyo. Although it serves as a compilation of answers for inquiries about Tokyo, and Japan as a whole, Our Kawaii Tokyo is full of creative illustrations and personal experiences.''The concept of Our Kawaii Tokyo is for the reader to feel that he or she has two kawaii best friends living in Tokyo who are very keen to answer all his or her inquiries about traveling to Japan. There are so many travel sites for tourists going to Japan! But what makes Our Kawaii Tokyo different is the touch of kawaii and sophistication in every post. The posts are highlighted in accordance to Japan’s four beautiful seasons and is designed to cater the reader’s needs in each season, such as “how to differentiate cherry blossoms from plum blossoms“, “where to find plum blossoms“, “when are the cherry blossoms scheduled to bloom“, and many more.''Our Kawaii Tokyo aims not only to help readers in their future travels but also to make them feel that they are already living here in Japan. This will give them the positive mindset that they will also travel and live in Tokyo like Ashley and Kaila. The authors are both dreamers and go-getters that aim to make Our Kawaii Tokyo a successful book and e-book comprising of many chapters.''Our Kawaii Tokyo‘s first book is targeted to be released this 2016.''Now here\xa0are the top 5 things that I think you should know about Japan!''.''Things Foreigners Should Know About Japan''#1:''“Kawaii” is considered as a lifestyle in Japan.''Kawaii''(cute) is almost a way of life. It’s pretty normal to have cuteness embedded in the Japanese people’s\xa0daily fashion, and life in general. There are the cute''bentos''(packed lunch), Disney-fied Milk tea bottles, pig-shaped pork buns, Totoro cream puffs, promotional character mascots for each prefecture, and so much more.''As you can tell, “''Kawaii''” or cute culture surely contributes a lot to Japan’s economy. Wherever you go, there is a hint of “''kawaii''” in almost everywhere and\xa0everything.''For one thing, Tokyo never seems to run out of kawaii café ideas for cute lovers to visit! Some of these kawaii cafes are Kawaii Monster Café, Cinnamoroll Café, My Little Pony Café, Owl / Rabbit / Cat Cafés, Sailormoon café… and so much more.''Most of the time, companies market their products and services effectively by coming up with cute packaging design (that will make you by the product even if you find it useless, haha) or by having kawaii personalities as endorsers like''Kyary Pamyu Pamyu''(dubbed as the Kawaii queen or princess of Japan).''#2:''There is no “best season” to travel in Japan…''…because''ALL''seasons have their unique experiences to offer! Once you travel to Japan once, you will find yourself coming back and wanting to travel in''all''four seasons.''During winter season, you can enjoy the illuminations that lit up the city with its rainbow-sparkling lights. You can go snowboarding or skiing in Nagano and have a relaxing time in a Japanese onsen (hotspring).''Experiencing cherry blossoms in Japan when it’s springtime should be included in every traveler’s #BucketList. There are the seasonal Starbucks Sakura lattes, hanami viewing (flower viewing) picnics in the parks, and lots of kawaii pink trees enveloping the country.''During Summer, you can go and visit Hokkaido for their famous flower (lavender, sunflower, etc.) fields. And all over Japan, many people dress up in yukata and attend Japanese festivals with their friends and family. Experiencing a Japanese festival even for once in your life is truly an unforgettable memory. Imagine a row of food stalls, festival games, and fireworks display afterwards. Even if Japanese summer is sometimes unbearable because of the heat, you can always munch on the yummy''kakigori''(Japanese shaved ice) being sold in Japanese''matsuris''(festivals).''Autumn in Japan is also a breathtaking encounter for any traveler. Not too cold and not too warm; it is just right to go and have an spontaneous adventure in Kyoto. For photography enthusiasts and photobloggers, autumn in Kyoto will absolutely mesmerize you. You can also have a''maiko''(apprentice geiko) makeover experience while you’re in the heart of Japan.''These are just a few of my\xa0recommendations. As you can tell, it’s so hard to answer the question''“When is the best season to travel in Japan?”''because Japan has thousands of things to offer for a wide-eyed traveler!''#3:''When in Japan, do as the Japanese do.''Before coming to Japan, do learn about their manners first.''In Tokyo, people stay at the left of the escalator if they are not in a hurry to make way for those who want to go up first. Inside the trains, it’s advisable not to cause hassle for others or converse in a loud voice. In other areas and shops, photography is prohibited (you would know if there is a sign) so it’s best to ask for permission first if you don’t want to be called out publicly.''Here’s a''helpful page''where you can learn about the other manners every foreigner should know before coming to Japan first.''#4:''You can enjoy tax-free shopping in Japan by bringing your passport with you.''Yep, you can shop until you drop without breaking a bank!''If you are planning to shop at the major department stores or gadget stores, it is advisable to bring your passport with you so you can get reimbursement for the 8% consumption tax.''Here’s a tax-free shop locator guide that might be helpful: [''click'']\xa0Besides tax-free shops, there are vintage shops or\xa0thrift stores in Japan as well! If you love second-hand goods, books and\xa0magazines,''BOOK OFF''is a great place to shop.''#5:''Japan is super safe, but there can be… weird scenarios.''Though it is super safe in Japan (crime-wise and besides, people do NOT\xa0really steal here), be warned that you might encounter weird scenarios or circumstances during your stay.''Japan may be a safe place to leave your bags on your chair while you go to the toilet, but it’s not really a completely safe place if you’re a woman. Wondering why Japanese smartphones cannot have a silent camera even when it’s on a silent mode? It’s because of the “''upskirting''” practice done by perverts (a.k.a. “''Chikan''”).''Also, there might be times that your train gets delayed for 30 minutes. If that happens and you hear “passenger injury (''jinshin jiko'')” being announced, it might be because somebody passed out inside the train or… somebody jumped off in front of the train.''Anyway, these are just isolated cases so you do not have to worry so much. Even if Japan appears to be a perfect first-world country because of the notable cleanliness, efficiency, culture, manners, and so much more, just like any other country; it has its own share of cons as well.''.''BIO & INTRO''My name is Ashley Dy and I am the other half of''OurKawaii.Tokyo''. When I was a child, my dream is to travel the world and of course, that’s what I’m trying to do until now — slowly but surely. I blog about the essential part of my life at''AshleyDy.com''I was born in Greenhills, San Juan, and spent most of my years in Manila as well. After which, I moved to Japan when I was 20 years old. Whilst in Japan, I’ve already lived in three prefectures, Hyogo, Osaka and Kanagawa.''Tokyo is one of my favourite cities in the world. There are endless of things to do — and they are most of the time available only for a limited time! …How can someone not love Tokyo?

It’s definitely a dream come true!''#6:''Japan has best transportation system (in the world!)''You can easily travel anywhere via train!''TIP'': Get a''JR Pass''. It’s like an unlimited pass to anywhere using JR (government-owned) trains if you want to maximize your trip by traveling to lots of prefectures (that’s what they call their regions in Japan). Only tourists are allowed to use this, so you are very lucky if you are! Normally a round trip fare from Osaka to Tokyo is worth $250. Imagine how many places you can visit within 7 day if you have a JR Pass!''You can buy your JR Pass online here:''Japan-Experience.com''7 day JR Pass: $243''14 day JR Pass: $387''We also posted a how to travel around Tokyo with suica card''here''.''#7:''Fukubukuro (lucky bags) season is the best time to go shopping in Japan.''Photo by''Laura Tomàs Avellana''/ CC''It happens every first week of January. Some stores start on the first day, some on the second due to their New Year traditions — it depends. So if you have a specific store in mind, check their website about their schedule first!''The best or worst area to go shopping to is actually Tokyo. It’s the best since most brands have a store in Tokyo, but it is also the worst since it is cramped with people. They line up so early (it’s freezing in January mind you), just for this sale.''TRIVIA:''The''KonMari''method of cleaning by Kondo Marie is actually a New Year’s tradition for the Japanese. They do a general cleaning, they keep things that they want, and throw the unnecessary before New Year. This was picked up by the retail businesses of course so they took this opportunity for a New Year’s / Lucky bags sale (wherein they put random items and sell at a lower price).''#8:''MYTH'': “Expensive” Japan''It might be true 5-6 years ago when I moved to Japan; but recently, everyone could just afford going to Osaka or Tokyo. There are lots of LCCs (Low Cost Carriers) that fly to Japan’s main cities. The chances of getting a cheap shared dorm room\xa0or''AirBnB''is also endless.''How to survive in Tokyo?''The answer is''konbini''(convenience store). It’s the best place to get fast and cheap food. Your ¥1000/$8-10 (depends on the exchange rate) can get you far.''What else could you do in a convenience store? You can buy your tickets to theme parks in advance, you can withdraw cash from their ATM (if your bank allows international use), use FREE\xa0internet, read manga while waiting, etc.''#9:''Japanese people are innately nationalistic.''That’s how they were trained in school.''They are usually proud of their “''unique''” traits such as using the chopsticks really well. Don’t be shocked or don’t feel\xa0offended if someone greeted you that you are good or bad in using chopsticks. It’s just their way of starting conversations.''NOTE:''Japanese are really known for keeping their true feelings too; so they can use general topics such as the weather, just to talk with you.''#10:''On Traditions.''Aside from what I stated earlier about New Year traditions of cleaning up and buying lucky bags, they have a lot more such as''The Coming of Age Day''which is\xa0celebrated every second Monday of January. Its purpose is to officially celebrate everyone who turned 20\xa0(the legal age in Japan).''Another famous (yet ridiculous) tradition in Japan is to have KFC chicken for Christmas. Since Japanese people are mostly Buddhist, Shintoist or both, they are not supposed to have Christmas celebration — but due to commercialism, they are actually celebrating it now. Though… it’s mostly for couples dating (like how we usually celebrate Valentine’s Day).''You can read more Japanese traditions''here.''We hope that these 10 things (trivia) that Ashley and I have shared will be useful for you as you plan and plot the places you want to travel to in Japan!''For any\xa0travel-related recommendations, just head on over to our blogs!''.''Overall''If you’re from\xa0Japan or an ‘expat’ in Japan\xa0like Kaila and Ashley, do you agree with the 10\xa0points that they\xa0wrote about?

Their main varieties are namely:''LifeStraw Personal Water Filter (basic)'': $19.95 ~ This is made of durable plastic that contains no chemicals, uses no batteries, and is BPA-free.''LifeStraw Steel Water Filter'':''$54.95 ~ Made of food-grade stainless steel that meets the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulations and standards. This is almost the same as the basic LifeStraw bit with a msleek steel exterior and 2-stage water filtration process.''.''For this post though, I’ll focus mainly on LifeStraw basic and the Steel version since they’re the most ideal essentials for individual travelers — plus, I’ve already tried and tested both of these items. Nevertheless, below are some other variations that can fit your other kinds of adventures!''LifeStraw Go'':''$28.94 ~ This is basically a basic LifeStraw water filter that is incorporated into a sports bottle so that when you’re on a long hike, for example, and are not sure when you would find a water source again, you can then just\xa0easily store the fluids with this thing.''(Of course you can just use your own water bottle partnered with the basic LifeStraw).''LifeStraw Family 1.0''and''LifeStraw Community'': $57.96 and $329.95 ~ this is more for large volume water purifications''(for expeditions, camping/hiking in groups, communities, etc.'')''with more stringent features like removing viruses.''.''They are affordable and well-priced with very advanced water filter systems.''The most basic of the LifeStraw series can already give you the following benefits:''Filters up to 1,000 liters (264 gallons) of water''Removes 99.9999% of waterborne bacteria (>LOG 6 reduction), including E-Coli''Removes 99.9% of waterborne protozoan parasites (>LOG 3 reduction), including Giardia & Cryptosporidium''Reduces turbidity (cloudiness or muddiness of water) and particulates (dirt), filtering down to 0.2 microns''Does NOT use iodine or iodinized resin\xa0and has very high flow rate\xa0— this means that it will have no bad aftertaste like what you might normally get from iodine tablets''Whereas the LifeStraw Steel will give you added features like the following.''Reduces chlorine''Reduces organic chemical matter (Pesticides, Herbicides, VOC)''Meets U.S. EPA drinking water standards''A 2-stage water filtration process''Hollow fiber membrane:''with Lifetime of 1,000 liters (264 gallons) that can do the same functions as basic LifeStraw''Activated replaceable carbon capsule:''with Lifetime of 100 liters (26 gallons) that reduces chemicals such as chlorine while also reducing organic compounds (including pesticides and herbicides), odor and bad taste.''.''Great for emergencies and preparedness.''For the outdoors: whenever you’re unsure of water safety while camping or hiking, LifeStraw has you covered.

Rest assured, the LifeStraw Steel version can clean out the chemicals! And if you are looking for a high-capacity filter that can remove viruses, the LifeStraw Family 1.0 will be able to do that as it removes 99.999% of viruses in the water!''.''With this in mind, it helps to take note of\xa0where you’re going so that you’ll know\xa0what kind of LifeStraw filter that you’re going to bring. The way I see it…''If you’re going to hike, for instance,\xa0in places located in\xa0Northern America and Europe (which generally have bodies of water that have no chemicals or serious contamination), the basic Lifestraw is enough.''But for when you’re venturing out to 3rd world countries who have very questionable waters (with potential viruses, human waste, etc.), the Lifestraw Family would work best. When it comes to\xa0waters wih some chemicals like chlorine, pesticides and fertilizers, the LifeStraw Steel can already fit your needs too.''.''»''How to use LifeStraw?''It’s very easy! The basic and steel LifeStraw filters are constructed like small tubes and they have specialized filters inside of them. In order to drink safe water, simply place one end in the unfiltered liquid (''this can be a river, a puddle, a water bottle, etc.)''and then suck the water from the top.''As the name goes, it’s really just like a''straw''!''IMPORTANT NOTES'':''Before use,''uncap the LifeStraw and hold it upright in the water for a minute because this would allow the water to creep up the filters. Do 5 quick ‘sucks’ and then the water should flow through easily. Take note that when you’re drinking from very muddy water, you may have to blow back into the straw from time to time in order to push out the turbidity (particles, mud, etc.) if you feel that the water flow is starting to slow or stops.''.''NOTE'': For the LifeStraw Steel, remember to change the carbon capsule every 3 months after first use to ensure that the 1st stage of filtration works well''.''After 1,000 liters of use,''the LifeStraw will stop drawing in water through the filter. You will find out if it has reached this capacity when it’s no longer able to draw in water through the filter. (To extend its life, always follow the instructions on the manual to properly back flush it).''.''The shelf life:''LifeStraw products use mechanical filters to remove contaminants from the water source\xa0so there are no\xa0chemicals or moving parts involved with\xa0the filtering process. This means then that\xa0NOTHING\xa0will expire.''.''After every use,''just blow the water out of the LifeStraw to clean it.

Apart from those, it also holds a high\xa0relevance to historical events such as those that are related to\xa0World War II (''think Auschwitz among many others'') — therefore, when\xa0I got\xa0the chance to travel to this wondrous\xa0destination in Central Europe at the start of this year, I immediately jumped on the opportunity to do so!''And in the end, it was an experience that I will forever cherish…''So if you’re ever planning on including this in your upcoming''Eurotrip''(which you should!) please look no further because it is in this post\xa0that I will divulge with you an ultimate travel guide to Krakow, as well as a list of the top 10''FREE''things that you can do in this wondrous city!''.''Free Things To Do in Krakow''#1''– Do the Royal Road or Royal Route to visit Krakow’s historic center (Old Town)''The medieval ‘''Old Town''‘ (''Stare Miasto'')\xa0is where you\xa0will see most of the popular tourist attractions in Krakow. In fact, you would find here''Europe’s largest market square,''and as a whole, it is\xa0a''UNESCO World Heritage Site''! Because of that and more, it was an absolute joy to walk through this area.''In order to explore this historic center better, I advise going through the''Royal Road or Royal Route''which starts at the northend of Old Town, through the center, and then down to the south on Wawel Hill.\xa0To give you an overview of how this route goes like, you can see''this map''. Now as the name goes, it is called as such because it\xa0was once the route of royal processions, parades, receptions and funerals.''For this, there are tons of landmarks to see but the most notable of them would be:''St. Florian’s Gate or Florian Gate''(Polish: Brama Floriańska)''Located north of the Royal Route, this is one of the best-known Polish Gothic towers that\xa0used to be the main entryway to the Old Town. Towering at 33.5 meters tall, this is the only remaining city gate out of the original 8 that were built in the Middle Ages (the rest were taken down during the modernization of Krakow). You will also see near this landmark the''Kraków Barbican''which is a fortified outpost that used to be connected to the city walls, and which is also\xa0one of the few remaining relics of fortifications that used to exist in the city.''.''Floriańska Street or St. Florian’s Street''(Polish: Ulica Floriańska w Krakowie)''This is a 335 meter stretch that leads to the Main Square\xa0and it is one of the most famous streets in the city. Nowadays, it has become a major tourist attraction since\xa0apart from the shops and restaurants that adorn this street, there are also a number of notable''kamienica''-style buildings (historic town houses) located here with their gorgeous colors of pastel yellow and peach.''.''Main Square''(Polish: Rynek Główny)''This is the market square that is deemed as the largest in Europe at roughly\xa040,000 m''2''! The landmark\xa0highlights of this place would be:''A week ago, Jonas and I were going to fly to''Krakow''in order to meet our friends from the Philippines.\xa0I wasn’t only looking forward to this\xa0meeting, but I was also looking forward to the fact that I would be visiting such an\xa0amazing city in Poland. While I was making plans on our itinerary though, I suddenly had the idea of hopping\xa0over to Budapest, Hungary\xa0afterwards, given\xa0how\xa0it wasn’t too far off.''Getting on a train was the obvious choice for us, but I started thinking:''is there another way to get to Budapest without missing out on Slovakia — an equally mesmerizing country that is located in between?''…And that’s when''Daytrip''stepped into the picture!''They invited Jonas and I to experience their service and when they reached out to me about this, their timing was just simply\xa0impeccable. They were even the perfect ‘answer’ to my travel concern, and as I learned more about their brand, I realized how\xa0their overall business concept\xa0is pure\xa0genius.''Thanks to them, we embarked on a private car transfer from Krakow to Budapest along with an experienced local guide who took us to 2 awesome\xa0hidden gems in Slovakia along the way — “gems” of sights that would have been\xa0difficult to reach using traditional public transportation.''Simply put…''we went on an epic road trip!''.''Daytrip''Daytrip is a new travel platform in Europe that is the first of its kind, and since I am now based and traveling here in this continent, this\xa0might just be my new favorite travel service!''»''Why I love Daytrip:''— They offer transfers between cities\xa0via a private car!''As of this moment, they offer''a vast array of routes''between 6 European countries, and I assure you that they’re slowly adding more to their list. (Other sample popular routes that they have is:''Prague to Vienna, Berlin to\xa0Cesky Krumlov,''etc.)''It’s a''door-to-door service!''This means that they can pick you up at your location, no matter where it could be\xa0(your hotel, apartment, etc.) and then\xa0the same would apply when dropping you off. With this, there’s no need for you to worry about connections between buses, trains, or cabs!''The whole journey''can take less hours as compared to taking an express train and cab''. Example, a trip from''Krakow to Budapest''with Daytrip will only take you around 6 hours whereas\xa0a train connection will take you about 10 hours!!!''Basically, you can''experience a good ol’ “Eurotrip”''without\xa0going\xa0through car rental problems''(because dropping off a rental car in different country than where you picked it up can be very costly).''And so — Daytrip\xa0will arrange all the vehicular concerns, leaving you with\xa0nothing else to worry about. You’re even free to let\xa0them know of the kind of car that will best suit your needs; therefore, no matter if you’re a family traveling with children or if you have lots of luggage on tow, they can surely accommodate your requests.''.''— They give you the chance to stop by your chosen sights\xa0along the way!''The thing about express trains is that it does''NOT''give you the chance to stop or do a detour along the way, especially if there are great sightseeing options in between the cities that you are transiting to. So if you’re on a Eurotrip spree, such could be a waste! But NOT with Daytrip because you can''customize your stops or itinerary''.''They would also even suggest an array of stopovers that you can do in between cities, and they typically''recommend the top 2 sights''that you must see.''(As a norm, 2 sightseeing stops is best; otherwise, if you simply aim to just take photos and not walk around, you can go to\xa0more\xa0stops).''.''— They give you an all-in-one driver and local tour guide!''What better way to get acquainted with the places you’re passing through than with''a true-blue local'', right? Our driver-slash-guide during our Krakow to Budapest route was''Jan Prokop'', and he was a joy to be with! He was very warm, fun, friendly, and above all: he was a fountain of information. We learned tons from him and we had several interesting discussions as we drove through Slovakia.''Rest assured, it is''absolutely\xa0safe''to travel with Daytrip because all their guides are strictly screened for any criminal and traffic records. They always do personal interviews and inspections not only regarding the drivers’ background and personality, but also with their automobiles.

This is why some travelers would just overpack (''uh-oh'') or if not, once there\xa0is ever a need to do the laundry, 3\xa0choices would often come to mind:\xa0pay for a laundry service, hand wash the\xa0clothes in a\xa0questionable sink, or\xa0reuse the\xa0dirty\xa0clothes (''yikes'').''Most of the time, these 3 options are not so\xa0ideal —''expensive, tiring, icky''— so is there a better choice? Thankfully, an Aussie guy invented the world’s first-ever portable “washing machine” that can wash your clothes in just under''30 seconds''! Introducing… the''Scrubba Wash Bag!''.''Scrubba Wash Bag''»''What is a Scrubba Wash Bag?''Weighing less than 5 oz. (or 145 grams), the Scrubba™ Wash Bag is the world’s lightest and most compact\xa0“washing machine” (''when rolled for storage, it can be at around 6 x 2 inches only''). To be more precise, it’s like a''portable washboard''but unlike the traditional washboards that we have,\xa0this won’t take up so much space in\xa0your\xa0carry-on luggage or backpack.''With these in mind, you can absolutely do your laundry anywhere and anytime — there’s no need for electricity and it only requires a small amount of water.''»''How does\xa0the Scrubba Wash Bag work?''Like I’ve mentioned, the Scrubba Wash Bag\xa0functions like a washboard\xa0but with a modern twist! With its internal Scrubba™ nodules, it\xa0efficiently cleans your clothes in a jiffy and the wash always ends up like ‘washing machine quality’!''To use, you just need to follow these simple steps:''FILL''the Scrubba Wash Bag with\xa0water (2-3 liters), cleaning liquid and clothes (1-6 items) \xa0—''TIP'': Better to use liquid detergent since if you use powder, it will take a while to melt''ROLL''down the top for\xa0at least 4\xa0and up to\xa0times and''CLIP''the ends (like you would with a dry bag)''DEFLATE''the bag. You can open and squeeze the valve to expel air''RUB''the clothes by pressing down\xa0against the Scrubba Wash Bag. Its\xa0unique internal flexible washboard will work its magic on your clothes as you this!''(There are grip circles on the outside of the bag too\xa0that would prevent the bag from sliding while you’re rubbing it).''Do this for 30 seconds for a quick wash, or for 3 minutes for a machine quality wash. (''For your delicates, press and rub gently'')''RINSE.''Unclip and unroll the the Scrubba Wash Bag and then pour out the water. Rinse clothes by simply filling it up with water and then\xa0shaking it.''DRY''clothes! It’s that easy!''You can also watch the video below to see how it works:''»''What are the advantages or benefits?''A LOT''. To name a few:''Wash clothes FASTER''. As mentioned, you can do a quick wash for only 30 seconds, or if you want a machine-quality wash, you can do it in just under 3-5 minutes.''Wash CLEANER.''Say goodbye to dirty or questionable hostel sinks and tubs!''LESS expensive.''As compared to when you pay for a laundry service in your hotel for example.''LESS harsh.''Unlike a washing machine, this won’t be too harsh on your clothes, all the while without sacrificing the cleaning quality''NO risk.''Compared to when you pay someone to do your laundry, using a Scrubba Wash Bag gives you the assurance that you won’t suddenly be missing a few clothes and\xa0that they won’t come back to you in another size or color! (''I’ve had several bad experiences in Asia whenever I use a paid service. -sigh-'')''NO pain''as compared to handwashing which often leaves me with coarse skin and red knuckles.''TWICE as effective''as when you hand wash your clothes!''PEACE of mind.''No matter if you’re just packing a small carry-on or a month’s worth of clothes,\xa0you got it covered!''Has TONS of uses.''You can use it as a dry bag, or later on use it for your delicates at home, or for when you’re out camping, hiking, backpacking, back to the dorms, etc.''Use of LESS water.''Each load on a Scrubba Wash Bag can only be about 2-6 liters! So as a traveler, you’re helping in conserving more water.''.''Overall''Back in 2013, I was whisked away to''Bohol''by my friend, Joanne,\xa0when\xa0she gave me the opportunity to be\xa0her +1 for\xa0her sponsored''travel trip''(at that time, I was not running this blog yet\xa0since\xa0this was launched a year after).''We had an amazing time in that magical island in Visayas — but there was one activity we did which I\xa0realized was an unethical for-profit business, AND\xa0which I unknowingly supported… It was\xa0the time when we visited\xa0the''Loboc Tarsier Conservation Area''.''Let me explain…''.''What Is a Tarsier?''A tarsier\xa0is a primate''(think apes and monkeys)''that belongs to a 45-million-year-old animal family called as Tarsiidae.\xa0Their group used to be more widespread; but today, they are officially recognized as\xa0endangered species that are predominantly found in Southeast Asia such as the places of the''Philippines'', Malaysia, and Indonesia.''As\xa0you will see from the photos in this post, they hold\xa0a\xa0distinct characteristic: a small body with\xa0BIG eyes.''(The way I see it, they’re like a cuddly-looking smaller version of Yoda… Don’t you agree?)''Anyhow, for the rest of this post, we will focus on the Philippine tarsier which is mainly seen in Bohol.''Here are some\xa0more interesting facts about\xa0them:''Smallest primate.''The Philippine tarsier measures at around 3 to 6 inches tall;\xa0thereby making it the smallest primate there is. Naturally, they are very hard to spot in\xa0the forests.''Largest eye-to-body ratio''in all mammals which gives them\xa0great night vision.\xa0During the day, their eyes can constrict until their pupil will only look like a thin line; in the dark though, their pupil can dilate and fill up their entire eye.''Fixed eyes.''Their eyes are fixed into their skull so they cannot turn their eye sockets, instead their neck allows them to rotate their head 180°!''Solitary, shy, and territorial.''Leading a mostly hidden life, a male tarsier needs at least 6 hectares of space and a female tarsier needs at least 2 hectares. If other tarsiers come into their territory, they will fight for it, and it can often lead to the death of the other.''Nocturnal.''They become active only at night and it is only during this time that they will crost paths with other tarsiers when they hunt for their food — mostly insects.''Arboreal,''meaning that\xa0they love to cling vertically to trees and branches as they leap from branch to branch.''How did tarsiers become endangered?''Because of several threats:''Habitat destruction.''The dwindling of the forests which are the tarsiers’ natural habitat had truly posed a significant threat to their survival.''Human hunters & pet trades.''Tarsiers don’t do well when in captivity since they''can easily and quickly turn suicidal''as they try to break free: they will willingly bash\xa0their heads in, which then leads to their death. Too much noise, sunlight, and physical contact from foreign things (us humans) can also over-stress them, which then leads to suicide as well.''Predators.''Other than humans, some of their ‘enemies’ are house or domesticated cats, snakes, owls, large birds, and other smaller carnivores.''In order to help preserve the Philippine tarsier,\xa0a law has been passed that made it illegal\xa0to own\xa0a tarsier; unless when\xa0it is for educational and conservation purposes.''.''Why Avoid the Loboc Tarsier Conservation Area?''The Loboc Tarsier Conservation Area is a popular destination among tourists mainly because of its close proximity to Bohol’s famed spots like the Loboc man-made forest and the “''Chocolate Hills''“. It\xa0is also often a part of the packaged\xa0tours in the island, hence the reason why this became one of our experiences during our grand tour in Bohol.''My tour there was somehow interesting though (at first) since it was my first time to see a tarsier after all; but moments after we finished our tour, I had the gnawing realization that they\xa0were housing\xa0tarsiers in such poor conditions.''And as I did further research days after our trip, I even found out that they are''NOT''an official tarsier sanctuary!''#1 –''They are a non-official tarsier\xa0sanctuary''The''Philippine Tarsier Foundation''is the main non-profit private organization in the Philippines \xa0that seeks to protect the Philippine tarsier. It has strong support from the two leading ecotourism organizations in the country: DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources) and DOT (Department of Tourism).''With this in mind, here’s a''NEWSFLASH for you:''the Loboc Tarsier Conservation Area is NOT an official sanctuary area, and it is NOT supported nor run by the Philippine Tarsier Foundation''.''This was pretty apparent anyway because…''#2 –''The tarsiers are kept captive in poor conditions''I have heard that the Loboc Tarsier Conservation Area used to be smaller, and\xa0cages tarsiers; but at the time of my visit, they have ‘prided’ themselves for the larger space that they have and how their tarsiers are not “caged”.''However, no matter what they say or do, the fact remains that the tarsiers are held captive in this small viewing area. There may not be visible high walls to keep them in their land, but it’s apparent how they are caged before every ‘viewing day’.''You see, they have a pathway surrounding\xa0their compound which leads to certain tree spots where you can see the tarsiers. Obviously, they are''placed''there everyday for the tourists to see. Just look at the makeshift “roof” that each of these tarsiers\xa0have! That’s not natural… unless all these tarsiers built them or something. Ha – haaaa, no.''They seemingly can’t\xa0roam around either (I bet they control them so they don’t escape) and all of them were wide awake (remember\xa0how\xa0they should be nocturnal).''This is really no surprise since other than the factors I’ve already mentioned,\xa0the branches that they are in are somehow very close to the tourists —''to give people the better chance to take photos of them of course''. Hence, the tarsiers are basically subjected to human\xa0presence and noise for almost every minute and THIS\xa0would surely cause them constant stress!''Stress = high death rate = less chances of reproduction.''If I may add, these tarsiers who are perched on their own branches were in such close proximity to one another,\xa0which then goes against their need for ample territorial space. (Well, this place was\xa0a small area after all.)''Naturally, because of these reasons and more, I do NOT recommend visiting the Loboc Tarsier Conservation Area.''(Additionally, I’m just wondering why this area continues to exist because by law, owning tarsiers is illegal unless its for educational and conservation purposes. Though this place may claim itself as a conservation area, their conditions are far from ‘conserving’ the tarsiers — so I beg to differ.)''.''What is a Better Alternative?''If you still want to see the endangered Philippine tarsiers, I suggest that you rather visit the official place run by the Philippine Tarsier Foundation:''the Tarsier Research and Development Center''in Corella, Bohol (also called as the''The Philippine Tarsier and Wildlife Sanctuary'', in case you want to see their reviews on TripAdvisor).''NOTE'': To help you differentiate, the unethical one is located in''Loboc''; whereas this official sanctuary is located in''Corella.''Here in Corella,\xa0you can choose to do 2 things:\xa0see and observe the tarsiers in an enclosure, or in their natural habitat through the Tarsier Trail.''Rest assured, the net enclosure is only where they keep\xa0the\xa0tarsiers during\xa0feeding, breeding and display. It’s actually a free environment and it’s only enclosed to keep possible predators\xa0(cats, etc.). Besides,\xa0the tarsiers can jump out if it whenever they want to. In here, you are also allowed to take pictures without flash but only quietly so as not to disturb the tarsiers who are asleep.''The Tarsier Trail, on the other hand,\xa0is a pathway that goes through a 134-hectare area of wilderness\xa0— you can hike through it with a guide in order to try and catch a glimpse of a Philippine tarsier in the wild (while also acquainting yourself with the local flora and fauna).''»''How to get there?''This Tarsier Sanctuary is located 14 km\xa0from Tagbilaran (provincial capital of Corella) and 20 km from Loboc. To get here, you can take a bus that goes to Sikatuna. From there, you just need to walk in until you see their ticketing office.''(You can also ask your hotel for directions. Just remember to stress that you want to go to the one in Corella and NOT Loboc.)''»''Further\xa0Details''Website:''[''link'']''Opening Hours'': 9.00 to 16.00''Ticket Price:''Php 50 ($1) guided tour inside the enclosure''Time for Visit:''30-60 minutes''Rules:''No flashes. Keep your voice low. NO touching of the tarsiers. Don’t stay too long in one tarsier (5 minutes will do).''Trail:''As it is a natural environment, expect the trail to be muddy when it rains. Umbrellas are not allowed if it rains so bring a rain coat if ever.''Trivia:''You can also volunteer here! It will be a great experience to learn more about tarsiers.''.''Overall''It’s no news that the''Philippines''gained more international attention in the past years, and there are two main contributors that I could think of:''first'', the successful\xa0campaigns put forth by\xa0the DOT (Department of Tourism, “It’s More Fun in The Philippines”),\xa0and''second'': the articles (which often went viral) that are posted by\xa0several travel bloggers/writers\xa0who have been echanted by the country’s beauty.''In a blink of an eye,\xa0the Philippines’\xa0white sand beaches, limestone formations, and pristine islands have easily\xa0become a hit to a lot of\xa0foreigners.''However'', what a lot of people might not know is that there is still MORE\xa0to the country than the sea-and-sun\xa0combo.\xa0For one thing, apart from our breathtaking\xa0beaches and coastlines, we also have a''rich''collection of fauna, flora, history, landmarks, landscapes, and underwater life.''A perfect destination example for this would be this\xa0gem of a place in Visayas called as:''Bohol!''Deemed as the 10th largest island out of the 7,000 others in the Philippines, it’s not as internationally-famous as''Boracay''nor''Palawan''; yet, Bohol holds incredible sights and dive spots that can easily capture anyone’s\xa0heart. And I deem\xa0myself as\xa0fortunate to have seen its beauty, albeit for a short time.''It was in 2013 that I went here with two friends who graciously invited Jonas and I to join their trip. It was for\xa0just two days, but we were able to do the following activities that already gave us a glimpse of the wonder that Bohol holds — which I hope you could see for yourself!''.''Things to Do in Bohol''.''Wanna go Island Hopping?''Come and book with''KKday''so you can go on a private island hopping tour to the top beach destinations: Pamilacan Island, Balicasag Island, and Virgin Island.''.''»''Visit the famous ‘Chocolate Hills’''As a Filipino, I first saw\xa0Bohol’s Chocolate Hills in a ‘''Sibika''‘ (History) book back in elementary school and I find it a shame that I didn’t see it sooner… but I guess, it’s “''better late than never''“, right?''Now, as you can see, the Chocolate Hills (or as we Filipinos would call it:''Tsokolateng Burol)''is a unique geological formation comprised of unique cone-shaped hills that all look identical — almost. From what I’ve learned, there are at least 1,200 of them that span an area of more than 20 square miles! To be more precise though, these ‘hills’ are actually made of limestone covered with grass and they vary in sizes from 30 up to 120 meters in height.''“…WAIT''. You say ‘Chocolate Hills’''but they look so GREEN! What’s so chocolate-y about this?!”''You might be wondering this''^''and well, they are called as such because during dry season,\xa0between\xa0months\xa0of December and May, the grass that covers these limestone hills would\xa0dry up and turn into a chocolate-y brown color. This will then make them seem like endless rows of Hershey’s chocolate kisses — hence, the name.''(We rather visited in the month of July).''Other than ogling at the beauty of these hills, another funny past time that I did here was watching visitors\xa0making funny poses …Okay, fine, I admit: my friends and I did funny (sometimes stupid) poses too,\xa0but to save ourselves from the shame, I won’t be posting them.''TRIVIA'':\xa0Legend has it that these Chocolate Hills were created by\xa02 giants who decided to have one big messy fight with one another using sand and stones. When they became exhausted, they suddenly turned into friends. They started to have a jolly good time with one another, that in result: they forgot to clean up their mess — which then resulted to the Chocolate Hills today.''Before we drown ourselves in an amusing fantasy, in reality of course: this didn’t happen. But I guess this is a more ‘cool’\xa0explanation to give to tourists\xa0than saying: “''We don’t really know how exactly…''” I say this because there is actually no consensus yet as to how the hills have formed.\xa0The most accepted\xa0theory they have is that the hills are “weathered remains of some marine limestone on top of impermeable layer of clay”.''…Uhm, don’t look at me, I’m no scientist so that’s the best explanation I can give (by retelling you the phrase that I read on the signs haha).''NOTE'':\xa0Apparently, you can also rent an ATV and venture out into these hills! Worth a try if you ask me :)''.''It’s the start of a new year and January started off on''GREAT''note for me! Last year, as you might have already known, I was stationary\xa0here in Belgium for over 6 months — not only to work further on my business,''Adalid Gear'', but to also process my visa.''On the last week of January, I received the best news ever:''I got approved''which will soon grant me a temporary resident visa here in Belgium. Still and the same though, for every travel trip that I do alone in Europe and in anywhere else in the world, I still have to apply for visas (unless the country is visa-free to my Philippine passport). It sounds like a big pain in the ass but it\xa0is fine and dandy for me since I’m no stranger to''visa applications''anyway.''But of course! The\xa0awesome thing about this is that I can finally enter and exit Belgium at any time to travel to anywhere within the Schengen Area! I say this because processing this temporary resident visa didn’t allow me to get out of Belgium for the past months and though this country is amazing, of course I really wanted see other countries too. (So yep, I had to be patient!)''You might be wondering: “Why Belgium?” Jonas and I decided to have this as our ‘home base’ for the next years, and besides, we have already transferred the incorporation of ‘Adalid Gear’ here. Hence, I’m functioning here as a business owner per se, as well as a partner of Jonas (we both run the business after all) which helps me stay here longer.''Aaaaand''nope, I’m not married nor am I engaged. If I’m ever engaged, you guys will know! But for now, no one’s popping any ring LOL and it’s fine that way since I don’t think I’m ready to settle down yet.''Now, given this predicament,\xa0I finally have the chance to pursue the pending partnerships that I have with several tourism boards and travel companies… and well, guess what?''I got SO excited accepting invitations!''… that I suddenly realized how\xa0my calendar was getting so full.''(I had to calm down, decline some other invitations and move them for next year; or else, Jonas will get mad that I’m\xa0away all the time).''Anyway, if you’re curious about my travel plans for this year, see my tentative schedule below.

They ranged from regular trips with small planes from hell\xa0—''think 4-seater planes that looked like they can be ripped apart in seconds: loose screws and cracked panels attached together with masking tape\xa0—''to normal and military planes that often did emergency\xa0nose-dive descents or full-on sprees of\xa0turbulence.''Despite all of those however, I grew up as a teenage lass\xa0who had''zero fear towards the notion of riding airplanes''.\xa0I guess you can say that I have been''‘well-conditioned''‘ since birth because\xa0I did survive every\xa0ordeal, so any fear-inducing actions of any aircraft were things that I just naturally ignored.\xa0In fact, you would often find me calming down friends, family and even strangers whenever they get freaked out during airplane rides.''.''However, Here Came The Trigger…''Fast forward to when I was 21,''I was sitting in a big plane headed to Europe with over 18 hours of flight before me.''When it reached the 4th\xa0hour,''I was suddenly overwhelmed by crippling fear''.''My palms were sweating and I couldn’t relax — and that certainly surprised me. It surprised my friend too who was with me during the flight. As the roles were reversed with him\xa0calming me down in my seat,\xa0I tried to analyze my situation. “''Okay, what changed here?''” Am I suddenly scared of flying\xa0because\xa0I’ve become\xa0more conscious about flight accidents? Of the concept of life and death? Of the fact that there are two strangers that are flying this plane\xa0who\xa0I’m placing my life’s fate on?''But I shook my head and told myself that all of that just sounded absurd because I was never bothered by those thoughts\xa0before!''When the plane started go through turbulence yet again, I suddenly\xa0realized what was wrong:\xa01 to 3 hours of turbulence was fine — I was''programmed''to withstand that since childhood — but to stretch\xa0the experience for\xa0over 18 hours…?''Obviously, that\xa0stressed me out\xa0and''that’s''what changed me, and clearly, it suddenly triggered an irrational fear in me. After all, I wasn’t well-informed about turbulence either. I just knew that they typically happen but as I sat there for long hours, I wondered what is it really about? Does it signal danger?''Having absorbed these concerns, every fiber in my being was\xa0screaming and yearning for\xa0land;\xa0I badly wanted to get out in order\xa0to clear my thoughts but I was clearly stuck in that flying piece of metal with nowhere to go… Jittery and afraid, I didn’t know what else to do\xa0but\xa0I clearly didn’t want to inconvenience anyone (bad move of course). So\xa0for the rest of the trip, I just sat there clutching the sides of my seat until my knuckles turned white, telling my friend that I was fine, and letting\xa0myself be caged inside my own poisonous thoughts — thoughts that were forming\xa0ghastly scenarios while\xa0I slowly inched\xa0my way towards developing''pteromerhanophobia''(fear of flying).''When our plane finally landed, my anxiousness naturally subsided… but of course\xa0at that time,''I was terribly frustrated.''I absolutely didn’t want to experience that EVER again, nor did I want to''fully develop''my newfound\xa0fear of flying! Besides, I\xa0had to take another flight back home after that\xa0trip. Add the fact that\xa0I had\xa0more international trips planned for the future. I made\xa0the decision to''start\xa0a\xa0travel lifestyle''after all\xa0because\xa0it’s my one true dream;\xa0so\xa0for sure, I’m not going to let''yet another fear''stop me!''That’s why\xa0starting that day, I took the steps to manage my fear so that it wouldn’t get any worse.''Now I bet that you had a different situation that triggered\xa0your fear of flying —''it could definitely be something worse than mine''— but I can assure you that it’s always something that you can cope with, if not overcome.''With the help of the tips below (that I have personally done and of which I have\xa0gathered\xa0from people who have also managed to get over their fear of flying), it is with my hope that you too can get over this hurdle!''.''4 Steps: Cope\xa0With Your Fear of Flying''#1:''Find\xa0out exactly what\xa0you’re afraid of,\xa0and\xa0then face the facts''The various types of ‘fear triggers’ are vast, some of which are: turbulence, landings, take-off, crashes, and terrorism — they can surely range from small things to big ones and it’s important as early as now to identify what’s making you fear the concept of flying.\xa0Once you do,''“battle your fear with facts.”''It helps to make the conscious effort of researching data\xa0that would counter the misconceptions that you may have. Example…''TURBULENCE.''This was the trigger for me; to\xa0be more precise, prolonged and constant turbulence. After doing some research,\xa0I realized that my fear was unfounded.''Turbulence DOESN’T\xa0mean that the plane is going through problems or that it is going to crash:''it’s simply\xa0going through\xa0a change in airflow''. Hence, it’s perfectly normal and natural — much like that bump on the road that you experience while you’re out driving your car. In fact, if you ask pilots, it’s more of an ‘inconvenience’: they’re not worried about the plane going down, they’re more worried about passengers who might feel uncomfortable about it, and maybe if they are worried about something falling down, it\xa0will only be about your\xa0cups and plates. That’s all.''I can go on a long discussion about the scientific explanation for this but I think it’s best that you just read''this article''or simply Google about it.''As for other related occurrences that make you think that the airplane will go down, it helps to know this as well:''driving and riding cars are actually more dangerous than flying''. You’ve probably heard someone saying this and believe me, it’s''true''. Statistically speaking, you would have to take a flight every day for''123K\xa0years''in a commercial plane before encountering an accident (this is according to New York Times). Yet of course,\xa0when an airplane crash does happen, we make a big deal out of it! Have you wondered why…?''Well that’s because they are SO\xa0rare.''So why are flying accidents happening more\xa0rarely as compared to driving accidents? One of the reasons would be because the ‘vehicle’ (a\xa0commercial\xa0airplane) is operated\xa0by''experts''— two of them at least. You might not know this but pilots spend\xa0a lot of\xa0time in school but\xa0it’s not because flying is hard to learn (I’ve been told by a pilot friend of mine that it’s not that complex to do take-off or landing)\xa0but because\xa0flight schools simply\xa0train pilots\xa0over and over again so that they can handle EVERY possible occurrence that may happen while flying an aircraft.''Overall,\xa0whatever your fear may be, Google is just a click away. Otherwise, the following resources and courses can help you manage your fear better! (There are even apps that can help you out.)''(FREE)''Fear of Flying Help Course''(FREE)''Self-Help Program''(PAID)''Virgin Atlantic’s Flying Without Fear''(PAID)''British Airways’ Flying With Confidence''(FREE App)''SOAR: Conquer Fear of Flying''Now I know that some people can still retain their fear of flying no matter how you feed them with concrete facts and statistics (like me). Hopefully, the following tips can help to further alleviate it…''#2:''Confront your fear of flying''There is a thing which psychologists call as “''gradual exposure''“. It’s where you expose yourself to the thing you are afraid of…''bit by bit.''As an example, if the idea of flying makes you anxious right from the moment that you step foot in an\xa0airport, it’s therefore advisable that\xa0you\xa0start by\xa0hanging out in those airport terminals at first, or by volunteering to drop off your traveling friends over there until you come to acquaint yourself with the environment. Spend some time watching those planes take off and land too, so that\xa0you can slowly\xa0ease your mind with the idea of being in a\xa0plane again.''When that’s done with, proceed to\xa0the next level of\xa0confrontation: “''constant exposure''” — in this situation, it means\xa0that you should''fly often.''It’s very effective for\xa0overcoming your phobia of flying\xa0because every flight will provide you the opportunity to make the next one a lot more easier to deal with. In a way, it’s an act that will help you train not only your mind but also your body.''Now once you are on that plane…''#3:''It helps to distract yourself''Your mind is powerful — but that can be a\xa0two-edged sword. It’s''soooo''powerful that it can easily fill your head with drastic thoughts in a nanosecond; but on the flip side, it’s also very\xa0powerful that you can make it''tune out any fear.''You should take advantage of this\xa0latter capability by ignoring your woes, by pretending that your anxiousness doesn’t exist, and by constantly thinking happy thoughts! You are absolutely capable of training your mind to do these.''How exactly?''Distract your mind by focusing it somewhere else: a''movie'', a book, a soundtrack (pack a''noise-canceling headphone''!), a game, etc. — anything that could keep you busy.''By picturing the destination NOT the journey''. Fill your mind with wondrous thoughts of what you’ll be doing once you arrive! This will help give you feelings of anticipation instead of dread.''Chat with your ‘flight neighbor’ or your travel partner. One of the things that often alarms passengers other than changes in movement are the changes in sounds within the aircraft; so if you keep on yapping away''(or if you distract yourself with the things listed in the first bullet)''you can distract yourself from overthinking every suspicious noise that could\xa0trigger your fear of flying.''#4:''Seek ‘outside’ help''If all else fails, you can\xa0do either of these two things:''Talk to the cabin crew.''Seek for their help and advice. They are trained to handle passengers and any kind of situation inflight; so if you are ever anxious, don’t be afraid to ring the bell because they can surely aid in making you feel more comfortable all throughout the flight.''Seek a professional’s help.''Try formal courses that will help you get over your fear of flying (I have listed some of them in point #1)''NOTE'': You can also go to your doctor to ask for a suitable medication/drug that you can use during a flight. Some people have used sleeping pills, herbal teas, etc. and\xa0it’s possible these could work best for you as well because they are proven to work most of the time. But personally,''I don’t recommend medication''since it could never really answer the problem; it’s rather a form of ‘escaping’ the problem. I personally don’t want to depend on it… yet of course, I understand if this might be the only way for you for now. That being said, do use medication with caution!''While we’re still on the topic of substances, if I may add, try to''avoid caffeine and alcohol.''For one thing, the properties of caffeine can inadvertently cause nervousness and anxiety. In every flight, it’s important to''keep yourself well-hydrated''and your blood sugar on check — coffee is something that won’t fulfill this goal. Therefore, it’s rather best to stick to water and juices.''Whereas for alcohol, though it helps for a short while,\xa0you should know that drinking one glass during a flight would equal to drinking nearly two because\xa0when you’re high up in the air, there is less oxygen than what you would normally breathe when on ground thereby making you more intoxicated. Additionally, you can get more motion sickness because of it and that definitely wouldn’t be pleasant at all. (Save for the fact that you might inconvenience the people around you once you start to reek of alcohol or become\xa0too tipsy).''.''Overall''As a traveler, I always take the time to learn a\xa0country’s local cuisine; hence the reason why\xa0a\xa0recipe\xa0post like this exists on this blog\xa0— besides, food is a part of travel after all!

That, I can assure you. ;)''For today however, I will be exposing you to a dish that is from my home country,''the Philippines'', and it’s called\xa0as''kilawin''or''kinilaw''.

You see, ceviche is normally soaked in citrus juices, but''kinilaw''is rather soaked in vinegar — nevertheless, both of these processes will ‘''cook''‘ the seafood since the acid will change its protein structure.''If you ask me, it’s actually an amazing transformation\xa0when you see the fish change from translucent pink to opaque white! Also, I like the''kinilaw''recipe better since it takes away more of the ‘fishiness’.''But YES\xa0— the best part about this''kinilaw''recipe is that it is so''EASY''to prepare and it''doesn’t involve cooking at all''! There’s really\xa0no need to put up a\xa0fire, and any cooking-challenged individual won’t have a hard time perfecting this dish either.''Some tips: to ensure that you make the best''kinilaw''there is, try to acquire FRESH fish.

While we might not have sprawling parks like Central Park and Hyde Park, we have plenty of nature! It’s true that most of our green spaces in the main city and towns are not for sunbathing or lying on, but we have plenty of country parks.''Besides, you have to remember that 2/3 of the country is actually\xa0made up of the ‘countryside’''and as a matter of\xa0fact, hiking is fast becoming the average Hong Kong citizens’ favourite past time.''With countless small mountains scattered across the whole of Hong Kong as well as several beautiful islands, there are no shortage of natural wonders in the land. For instance, I have climbed up Sunset Peak and trekked to see basaltic columns at one of Hong Kong’s geological parks. So if you do visit Hong Kong, make sure you see the other\xa0side of her too.''#2:''It’s only hilly on Hong Kong Island''I live in the New Territories region of Hong Kong and let me tell you – all the towns are flat over here. However, Hong Kong Island’s geology is different – it’s made up of volcanics that gives it its hilly topography. It surely makes for a dramatic cityscape, but then you would have to deal with all the stairs.''Did I mention I hate stairs?''#3:''You can use the Octopus Card for almost EVERYTHING''Photo by''Canadian Pacific''/ CC''Octopus cards started out as a way to pay for all the transport system (because they are under different companies), but it then went on to become a form of payment that you can use in convenience stores. And now you can use them to pay at shops, cinemas, supermarkets, fast food outlets, and even at hospitals!''It’s a top up card that’s not dissimilar to the Oyster Card of London, except it’s so much more. You can purchase one at any MTR station or convenience store for HK$50 ($6.40+) and you get discounts on travels.''TRIVIA:''The Octopus Card is widely used in Hong Kong — at about 95% of the population! But you might wonder, why is it called as such though…?''Well, in Cantonese, they actually call it as''Baat Daaht Tung''which literally means “eight-arrived pass” (or also as “go everywhere pass”). The number 8 refers to all directions (think north, west, south, east, northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast), it’s also a lucky number in Chinese culture (which could mean “getting rich”) and it also happens to represent the 8 different public transportation systems in Hong Kong. Coincidentally, the English name ‘octopus’ goes along with the #8 in the Chinese name too — since an octopus does have 8 tentacles!''#4:''Shops open late AND close late''It doesn’t apply to all shops, but most boutiques often don’t open until well after 11. You might get better luck in big shopping malls, but if you are going to privately owned shops like the ones I frequent in Mon Kok, then you better save your visit till lunch time.''On the bright side though, most shops don’t close until well after 8pm, so you will still have plenty of time to shop around.''#5:''Museums are free on a Wednesday''I am not sure how this came about, but all the government museums are admission-free on a Wednesday. My school used to take us to all kind of museum visits exclusively on Wednesdays, but bear in mind that it also meant that the place would be more crowded.''But hey – a dime saved is a dime earned!''#6:''We will stare, we will judge, but we do it to everyone''This will particularly apply if you are not of oriental appearance. Yet, even if you are of Asian descent, dressing differently to the locals will probably earn you some stares as well. But don’t worry – we just do it to everyone. It’s nothing personal; we are just a particularly judgy nation that enjoys gossiping about other people.''Aileen says:''Speaking of behavior towards other people, I found that\xa0Hongkongers (especially the younger crowd) LOVE to take photos with foreigners.

Naturally, a lot of people flock to the country to spend a well-deserved summer getaway — lounging around the beach and doing water activities.''However, there seems to be one breathtaking activity that a lot of travelers tend to overlook…''diving.''Of course snorkelling is a common activity and there are divers\xa0who specifically come to the country to do\xa0scuba diving… But in matters of\xa0common “must-do’s” in the country for typical tourists, I don’t often see people recommending this experience — which is a shame because there’s a whole other kind of paradise in the depths of our oceans that everyone should\xa0see and explore!''In short: scuba diving is something that you''MUST DO''when you’re in the Philippines! Why so…?''Well, did you know that the Philippines is often referred to as one of the''top diving spots in the world?''With over 40,000 square kilometers of coral reefs and a coastline that is almost twice as big as the United States, it’s an undeniable fact that we have a vast marine biodiversity in our waters.\xa0From\xa0shallow coral gardens for first-timers, up to more technical sprees where\xa0you can explore WWII wreck sites and deep technical dives — clearly we’ve got spectacular\xa0things for just about anyone!''If you’re wondering what are the best diving spots in the country, surely\xa0the''Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park''tops the list! As\xa0a protected area in the middle of Sulu Sea, it is regarded as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its very high density of marine species; it is also a typical favorite of experienced divers worldwide. There’s also the''Apo Island in Dumaguete''which is famous for its prolific marine life, as well as the wreck diving sites in''Morazan Maru in Coron Bay''and in''Subic Bay''(called as USS New York).''But… if you had to''choose one diving location in the Philippines''that’s not only near the capital of Manila but also has one of the most diverse marine variety,''Anilao, Batangas''is your best bet!''It’s also a site that is commonly recommended for first timers in the country; that’s why when I was presented with the opportunity to try scuba diving in Anilao back in 2014, I gladly said YES!''.''Anilao''A''barangay''in the municipality of Mabini – Batangas, Anilao is as a Marine Protected Sanctuary that is\xa0commonly regarded as\xa0the birthplace of scuba diving in the Philippines. Plus, with its close proximity to Manila (which is only 3 hours away) it has truly became a favorite destination for local and international divers, and most especially for beginners who are doubtful about traveling to far places in the country when it comes to their first diving experience.''Some trivia that you should know about Anilao:''Experienced divers refer to it as the best spot for underwater macro photography (small sea critters)''A photographer’s paradise — wrecks, caves, fishes, corals, they got it all!''A nudibranch paradise\xa0(meaning that it is filled with colorful shell-less marine mollusks)''(''For a detailed ‘travel guide’ to Anilao, like how to get there, where to stay, etc. — kindly scroll to the''bottom of this post'').''»''Anilao Dive Sites''There are over 50+\xa0dive sites around Anilao and they are primarily located in the southern area. With this in mind, it’s best to pick an accommodation that’s located towards the south so that you’ll have shorter boat rides to the\xa0diving sites (typically, boat rides can take up to 15 to 30 minutes).''See below a\xa0map for a list of the Anilao Dive sites:''Notable among these sites…''For rich underwater environments and muck diving:''Twin Rocks, Secret Bay, Kirby’s''For best wide-angle photography opportunities:''Beatrice Rocks''For advanced divers looking for healthy and strong currents:''Mainit Point''For best soft coral sightings:''Devil’s Point''For beginners: Any dive site along the shore.

Just take note that during those months, diving sites can get crowded especially during weekends.''For months to avoid, that would be\xa0July and August and that’s mainly because of the monsoons — it’s typically the rainy season and typhoons can happen; therefore, the seas can get very choppy and visibility can be very poor.''»''Diving Conditions''Diving is usually done with a small outrigger boat (''bangka'') that can take up to 4 divers with a crew of 2 to 3. Rest assured, the diving conditions in the Anilao dive sites are clear\xa0and ideal for scuba diving.''Water Temperatures:''Colder from November to February at around\xa024°C and then approximately\xa027°C from March to May.''Currents:''Gentle in most dive sites, but can be strong in certain places like''Mainit Point''Visibility:''This is a more technical thing that experienced divers look for and I was told by my diving instructor that visibility ranges from 3m to 20m depending on the season and the tides. (Naturally, visibility is poor during the rainy months of July to September).''»''Diving\xa0Costs''Diving packages are not only\xa0offered by small shops or providers but also by hotels and resorts around Anilao.''The average cost of a diving session\xa0is around\xa0$30\xa0(Php 1,500+)\xa0but this is for experienced or\xa0certified divers. For beginners, costs usually start at $64 (Php 3,000+)\xa0which includes complete diving gear rental, 2 to 3 hours of diving, and a diving instructor.''»''Other Diving\xa0Areas Near Anilao''Isla Verde''is a day trip away from Anilao and it has some spectacular walls.''Puerto Galera''is also a popular diving destination and you can easily transfer to this island via ferry or private boat.''You might be allured to stay over at Puerto Galera but trust me on this one: Anilao has better corals and diving experience in general. (Other experienced divers would agree!) It’s just that most people tend to choose Puerto Galera especially if\xa0they want more options for nightlife and restaurants.''.''My First Scuba Diving Experience''»''Getting There''Like I mentioned previously, I had the opportunity to try scuba diving for the first time back in 2014 when I was still in the Philippines and it was a prize that was given to me by the brands:''Nuffnang and Garnier.''The whole package included an overnight stay in''Eagle Point Resort''that included a\xa0beginner’s diving session for two — of course, I invited Jonas along!''Photo by''Ronrag''/ CC''First things first, the accommodation.''Eagle Point Resort''is nestled in one of\xa0Anilao’s\xa0diving spots:''Eagle Point''and given how it is\xa0located in the south, you definitely\xa0won’t have any problems of swiftly boating to the other diving sites. For us, they provided a free shuttle service from Manila\xa0and it took us around 2.5 hours to get to the resort (normally however, they charge around $233 or Php 11K for a round trip ride).''Now the place was great — a bit old but still charming, worth for its 3-star hotel rating. They have various facilities such as a bar, a restaurant (that strategically overlooks the sea), a play room, and a swimming pool. They also have a private beach with a picturesque port. In fact, sometime during the night, we saw a couple dining\xa0in that location (the staff seemed to have\xa0set it up specially for them). It looked very romantic! We didn’t get to see the ‘finale’ but we had a feeling that the guy was planning to propose. ;)''For the rooms, you can choose between four\xa0things: hotel-like rooms, suites, cabanas, or cottages. The cottages are more modern and secluded, whereas\xa0the cabana is like a cottage but designed more like a Philippine wooden hut. The hotel placed us in a cottage for 2 and it was''perfect''especially since we had our own balcony that overlooks the sea — it was surely a great place to lounge in especially for sunset viewing.''Moving on, let’s finally talk about the diving experience!''»''Diving Packages''Eagle Point Resort provides diving packages for both beginner and intermediate divers.''For intermediate divers,\xa0you must present a C-Card or a diving logbook that shows a record of your training in any level. All dives are non-decompression and a dive master will control and watch over all the dives (since they’re more familiar with the area). You can choose to bring your own gear or rent the resort’s stuff.''If you bring your own gear, the fee starts at around $50 (Php 2,400+)\xa0and it includes boat trips to 2 dive sites, weights, tanks, a dive guide and a dive ticket.''If you choose to rent the resort’s gear, fee starts at approximately $95 (Php 4,500+) and it includes the same perks as those who brought their own gear (of course, you’ll get\xa0all the necessaries: wet suits, gloves, fins, booties, mask, regulator and BCD)''For beginner divers, they offer 3 services:''Snorkeling or Skin Diving – $23 (Php 1,100)''1 whole day use of mask & snorkel with life vest, full foot fin and inclusive of a 1 hour dive guide at their in-house salt water reef pool''“Try Scuba” – $35 (Php 1,600)''Try how scuba diving is like in their reef pool with guidance from one of their dive instructors''Introductory Dive – $70 (Php 3,300)''Learn how to scuba dive! It includes lessons in their reef pool followed by a 20ft open water\xa0of scuba diving complete\xa0with skin diving equipment and guidance from one of their dive\xa0instructors''For Jonas and I, given how we’re complete beginners, we were given the Introductory Dive package.''What have we learned? Well… I don’t want to spoil the fun for you\xa0and delve into the complete details of our lesson — but I can give you ideas on what we mainly talked about:''underwater signals, safety, and proper gear usage.''»''And Down I go…''After I had my wet suit on, our diving instructor started to put the rest of the gear (oxygen tank, etc.) on my body and all I had in mind was:''“''I feel like a turtle…”''“Am I going to float with this? This is SO heavy!”''“Yep. I’m gonna sink and die. Probably.”''Mind you, this was actually a time that I haven’t learned proper swimming yet (I have a bad habit of doing water activities despite my lack of sea\xa0survival skills — for instance I’ve done ocean cliff diving before as well). Nevertheless,\xa0I at least knew how to swim and float underwater so I was fine to do the scuba diving experience — still, it was a fact\xa0that I was extremely nervous.''Our diving instructor must have seen the worried look on my face while he was assembling my gear and he flashed me a smile: “''Don’t worry. You’ll float with this gear once you’re in the water!''”''And guess what? I did. Obviously, I was worrying about nothing. So we first started out in the shallow waters near the resort so that we could adjust to the water along with our gear. At this point, while I was practicing my breathing with my oxygen mask on, I can’t help but think, “''I’m Darth Vader! YAAAAS.''”''Foolishness aside, once our instructor saw that we were ready to go deeper, he started to guide us further… and within minutes,''I was blown away by the scene before me.''It was amazingly colorful and full of life! (A view that I wouldn’t see by only doing snorkeling.) There were fishes and corals of every imaginable color and schools of fishes would often pass us by. Certainly, there were times that I had to stop moving because I was trying to fully process the magical situation that I was in…''“Yep,\xa0I’m finally and literally swimming with fishes!”''As if that otherworldly beauty wasn’t enough, our instructor urged us to go further using signs underwater and that’s when I started to clearly saw a “wall”.''Now… imagine this scene under the sea: a wall of colorful marine life to our left side and a vast space of''NOTHINGNESS''to our right\xa0— and we were floating between those two breathtaking spectacles!''At that point, I have to admit that I started to panic because I suddenly had ghastly thoughts of being swept away the wrong way and then, I’ll be unable to swim back to shore — all nonsense of course but a girl like me can’t help but be anxious. Thankfully and naturally, nothing bad happened and as we continued our dive\xa0for over an hour or two,\xa0I started to ease up again and fully enjoy the breathtaking experience.''I guess I’ll let the photos below speak for themselves and these all looked similar to what I saw during that day!''The only striking problem that I encountered from my first scuba diving experience was that it can be a bother to handle water that trickles\xa0in through my goggles. Our instructor said that it’s an unavoidable thing in diving — don’t panic if it happens to you. Rest assured, the trick he taught us helped a lot (clearing our masks underwater without surfacing), it just tends to be a hassle if it keeps happening all the time. So my tips?''Pick a mask that best fits you. To check this, place it on your face without pulling the strap over your head. Gently push the mask to your face and breathe through your nose — if it seals properly the first time then good news: it’s a good fit for you!''As you wear it, ensure that no strands of your hair are in the way since those can be gaps wherein water could trickle in.''For the ‘trick’ on how to clear the water in your mask while underwater, your diving instructor will teach you how to do this hands-on, but basically once water manages to get in, allow more of it to enter (you can pinch the bottom or top part of your mask to take in more). Once it is below your eye level, start holding the top part of your mask firmly against your forehead and once you’re ready, exhale slowly but forcefully through your nose as you slowly tilt your head up. Viola — the air from your nose will fill the mask and force the water out of the bottom of your mask! (This trick is also helpful when your goggles start to fog up.)''In lieu of that, as a first timer, it’s important that you''listen very well''to the instructions and tips of your instructor because they would really help! Also… don’t panic like I did. Haha! Just take it easy, your instructor knows the terrain well and can assist you at any time. Therefore in a sense, there are only two things that you really have to do:''follow instructions and have fun'';)''»''How to Get to Anilao, Batangas?''By car.''From Manila, it will take you about 2 to 3 hours depending on traffic.\xa0Simply enter SLEX (South Luzon Expressway) from Magallanes or Alabang Muntinlupa and go all the way to Star Toll, then exit at Diversion Bauan exit Rotonda.''By bus.''Go to the bus station located near LRT Gil Puyat Station and take a bus that has a signboard that goes to Batangas City (Calabarson).

I have done this ever\xa0since I was 14 years old and I commute to my work by train every single day (well okay, not on the weekends off course, that would be stupid). But it never really struck me as strange that the Dutch way of entering a train is to push as hard as you can to secure yourself a seat… Even if that means that people getting out of the train are having an impossible time to do so. But after living in London for 4 months, I realized that this behavior is actually quite strange. Some might even call it rude.''The British on the other hand have practically invented queuing. When I was queuing for a day ticket for Wimbledon, I received a 25 page booklet titled: ‘The Guide To Queuing’.

True enough, even if\xa0I had already discussed extensively\xa0the steps on''how to start a life of travel'', I haven’t really wrote\xa0a detailed guide yet on\xa0how to become a digital nomad — a profession that I have initially done in order to jumpstart my traveling lifestyle.''After months of putting this off, I finally got the\xa0time to write\xa0about it and I\xa0hope that it\xa0will immensely help\xa0those who want to lead a similar lifestyle!''I will definitely try to be very''thorough''about this, so to start off…''.''What is a Digital Nomad?''According to Wikipedia: “''Digital nomads are individuals that leverage technology\xa0to perform their work. It’s generally done in a nomadic manner\xa0wherein they work remotely —''from home,\xa0away from home, while on the road''— to accomplish tasks and goals that used to have traditionally taken place in a single stationary workplace. These digital nomads\xa0are often online business owners, web designers, graphic designers, software developers, and other types of knowledge workers who can perform work duties irrespective of physical location.''”''Simply put'':''a digital nomad makes\xa0full use of the technology''(''ta-dah: the Internet!'')''in order to work and earn income, and they\xa0can do\xa0their\xa0work''whenever''and''wherever''they\xa0are.''Example'':''» READ:''Types of Digital Nomads''Or for\xa0the most common representation:\xa0have you seen those photos of people sitting by the beach with a laptop on their laps…? Probably even sipping a piña colada while they’re at it? Well, those are us, the digital nomads — or to be precise, that’s how our\xa0lifestyle is''portrayed''to the public. I say this because it’s true in some aspects\xa0but for the most part:''it’s sometimes over-romanticized.''If you’re a long-time reader of this blog, you would know by now how I always like to show the reality behind any situation so that any misconceptions can be cleared early on. Therefore, let me break down this digital nomad lifestyle for you…''Benefits''to being a digital nomad:''The freedom to be\xa0your own boss.''You can control how much work you will take\xa0on and when to do\xa0it; therefore, you have great\xa0control over your own time and your own rhythm toward doing things (e.g. setting your ‘play’ and ‘work’ times, etc.)''You can travel the world!''This is the\xa0biggest selling point of this lifestyle. As mentioned previously, this type of career is ‘remote’ given how\xa0you can do your work online — a realm that is not bound to\xa0one stationary place — so it’s really no news to know or see\xa0digital nomads who hop from one exotic destination to the next while\xa0they work. (Apart from the enriching travel\xa0experience, it can be helpful to your budget as well since you can travel to countries that have lower costs of living; thereby lessening your monthly expenses).''You get to meet a lot of people'': locals in foreign countries, travelers, and fellow digital nomads. It’s even a typical occurrence to be thrown into situations where you can get the chance to connect with like-minded individuals. This is a really great thing because in such\xa0way, you could\xa0have the opportunity\xa0to bounce off ideas with people that would\xa0not only help improve you as a person, but could\xa0also help give you ideas in ascending your career and in building\xa0a remote/online business (which is customarily the\xa0grand goal of any digital nomad.)''Disadvantages''to being a digital nomad:''It’s not all about pleasure.''Most people think that what all digital nomads do is spend time away lounging on the beach since they only work\xa0less than 4 hours a day. Well o-kaaaay, that can happen (because I do work less than 4 hours a day now)''BUT''what I’m trying to say is that NOT everyone can do that\xa0immediately especially when a person is\xa0still''starting out''. At the beginning,\xa0you’ll most likely be\xa0shedding blood, sweat and tears, working 80% of the time (or even more) in a coworking space, internet cafe, coffee shop,\xa0restaurant or hotel room as you try to stabilize your clients and cashflow. Trust me on this because this is how I was before (but sure enough, once you get past that gruelling entry stage, it can get smooth sailing from then on).''A decent internet connection tends to be hard to come by.''This struggle is real. Since most of us digital nomads rely on the internet,\xa0an unreliable internet is a great inconvenience (and can easily transform us into vengeful monsters). Regrettably, this is a problem that we almost always face as we travel around the world.''It can still get lonely.''This is most likely to happen\xa0if you’re setting out in this lifestyle alone\xa0or if you don’t take the initiative to connect with people whilst you’re on the road. But then again, it’s also possible that no matter what you do, that feeling of homesickness can still creep in from time to time and it can be quite tough to beat.''Overall, to better manage your expectations about this lifestyle, you can also read my post\xa0below:''» READ:''5 Things to Know First Before You Quit Your Job to Travel the World''Once you get to read through that blog post\xa0and your mind is still set on pursuing a digital nomad’s lifestyle then that’s GREAT! Let’s proceed to the good part…''.''How to Become a Digital Nomad?''First, let’s start with 5 “''quick\xa0ways''” (starting from typical situations to extreme ones):''Going solo.''This means\xa0that you quit\xa0your job and transfer\xa0your current work online. This scenario works best for consultants (any type), teachers/tutors, lawyers, accountants, etc.''Arranging remote work.''If you don’t want to leave your office job, strike\xa0a deal with your current employer to let you work online instead. This works best if the majority\xa0of your tasks involve working on a computer. In other words: your physical presence isn’t that\xa0needed in the office. (If you want tips on how to approach your boss about this, you can read Tim Ferris’ book, the''4-Hour Work Week'').''Transferring\xa0online.''If you already own a brick-and-mortar business, consider of ways to move it online or of ways to manage it remotely. There are a LOT\xa0of tools already available, online and offline, that can help you make this arrangement possible (online accounting applications, webcam surveillance, manager hire, etc.)''Taking the entrepreneurial path right off the bat''. It’s one of the\xa0fastest\xa0ways (provided that you’re ‘loaded’ or prepared to take a big fat loan) BUT\xa0the most difficult as well. It gets riskier too\xa0if you don’t have any prior experience or connections to help you succeed.''Buying\xa0an existing online business''that you can run\xa0or\xa0that you can get passive income from. But remember: this is very risky (much like #4) especially if you’re not an experienced business owner. Some of the ways\xa0to buy businesses: franchises, online websites on''Flippa''or online businesses on''FE International''.''That being said,''CLEARLY''not everyone has an easily-convertible job, a flexible boss to permit you to work online, or\xa0a pot full of\xa0money to buy\xa0or start a business.''However'', the fact remains that YOU can still become a digital nomad.''You just need to start from the ground up. To do so…''.''1''.''Identify your skills and decide on the kind of work you want to do.''.''NEVER''underestimate what you can do''and''what you already know.''You might think that you have no skills right now to become a digital nomad; however, the fact alone that you can type and use a computer is a skill in itself that can already land you simple online jobs like data entry, translation, and more.\xa0Secondly, other than taking advantage of your current skills, look into your hobbies as well since there’s a chance that some of it\xa0can be turned into\xa0a ‘money-generating’ work online.''A perfect example of this:''my story''. You see, ever since I was 13, I was fond of learning and doing graphic and web designs. I enjoyed it a lot and I continued to do it only as a hobby and as a way to help friends who were in need (while\xa0I also continued to polish my skills and learn new ones). But when I started to meet digital nomads when I was 21, I realized that it\xa0was something that can be turned into a profitable and remote profession. I discovered that it could help me gain more income\xa0than what I was earning as a fresh graduate in an investment bank, and that it could also make me lead a traveling lifestyle! Right then and there, the door to a varied list of possibilities opened up for me — and it could be the same for you too!''To gain\xa0ideas on what kinds of digital nomad jobs that you can do or which you may love to do, check my article below:''» READ:''Several Types of Digital Nomads''TIP'': As you decide on the type of remote job that you can do, remember the notion of ‘diversifying your portfolio’. What do I mean by this? Well, for instance,\xa0other than eyeing the kind of work where you do data entry or administrative assistance, try to learn other set of skills too that can make you gain more job opportunities.''More work = more income.''And of course, the…''GOLDEN RULE'': Pick the kind of work that you LOVE to do so that it won’t feel like ‘work’ at all. It’s really imperative to choose something that you’re passionate about because in that way, it’s easier to be productive, and also definitely easier to be a master of it in the long run!''Along with this is another equally important advice that I typically impart:''“To work hard does not''always''equal to success… you have to work smart too.”''So always keep your wits with you, be resourceful, be proactive, be artful — be opportunistic (but without disregarding your ethics and principles).''.''2''.''Learn or polish the skills that you’ll be needing.''.''There are 3\xa0ways to learn digital nomad skills:''University Degree or Job Experience.''If you’re still young'', why not enroll into a university course or degree that’s related to the kind of digital nomad work that you’d like to do in the future?''Or if you’re a fresh graduate''that wants to experience the office life for a bit, go and aim for\xa0work\xa0in a company that can teach you the skills you’ll be needing in your future nomadic lifestyle. Through this way, you can also gain\xa0contacts that can be useful for your upcoming online work (example: working for an agency that does online marketing and advertising, etc.)''Paid Courses.''This is a no-brainer, but you can definitely enroll into courses that can teach you ALL\xa0of what you must\xa0know. The downside to this is that it can be costly; but for sure, it’s a good investment to your future.''Self-study.''Another no-brainer, and THIS is actually what I’ve done. (Yes, my knowledge about design, HTML, SEO, online marketing, etc. were things that I did NOT\xa0learn in school, work, or formal classes because I actually got a business degree and my first official job was in an investment bank.) In short: I just learned it all by myself! Even if the knowledge about graphic and web design were cultivated early on in my life, I still have managed to grasp the concepts about\xa0web development, SEO, and online marketing in just a span of 2 months.)''You see… the great\xa0thing about digital nomad jobs is that most\xa0employers\xa0are not requiring their freelancers to be degree-holders\xa0on\xa0the jobs that\xa0they’re offering. Why so? Well typically, they\xa0are just mainly\xa0concerned about''RESULTS''.''So your knowledge alone can work for them and this is often proved best by showing samples of your past work (via portfolios, testimonials, etc.)''So… how did I self-study?''I read books, but I primarily read stuff online.''Speaking of which — I’ve come to notice that a lot of people don’t seem to realize that there are''TONS''of''FREE''and cheap\xa0resources on the internet that can already make you learn a certain subject extensively! You just need to look hard enough.

I suggest that you keep this in mind at all times because this kind of attitude helped me a lot when I was starting out. How so? By developing relationships with fellow nomads and even online entrepreneurs, it helped me land a stable and well-paid\xa0freelance online work that enabled me to confidently quit my office job. Later on, my connections helped inspire me as well to set up the current business that I have today! Anyhow, other than networking with the nomads in the place you’re in, try networking online too via:''Nomad Forum''NomadList Meet-Ups''Web Work Travel Community''Nomad Network''Find a Nomad''Reddit''Facebook Travel Groups''.''4''.''Be versatile and always continue to strive for great client testimonials.''.''‘Following through’, consistency, and versatility can help you advance further (if not faster) as a digital nomad.''I’ve touched upon this topic previously but it doesn’t hurt to repeat it!

This is for the reason that as you continually aim for great feedback from your clients, it will\xa0help instill trust from other potential employers, it can\xa0help\xa0increase your chances of being hired again by the same client, and\xa0it might also help you gain future additional work via referrals.''(As you go on, remember to update and improve your profile or portfolio too.)''.''5''.''Plan your nomadic lifestyle.''.''Once you ensure that you will\xa0be having a steady cashflow every month from your online work (or simply after you get a decent travel fund saved up) it is then absolutely fine to start planning your exploration around the world!''I’ve already discussed this process thoroughly\xa0on my''5 steps article''of starting a life of travel;\xa0so it helps to read that first. But to reiterate, the main points that I mentioned there which you need to take heed of are:''»''Where to go?''It’s normally tough\xa0to go to 1st world countries if you are\xa0a 3rd world passport holder like me (since I tend to be\xa0treated like a terrorist or criminal — yep, no joke about that). Rest assured, it’s still possible\xa0with the right kind of preparation.''» READ:''How to Travel the World on a Third World Passport''So for starting nomads who have a ‘limited’ passport like I do, it helps to set aside those 1st world countries for a bit\xa0since the cost of living can be high.\xa0If you’re looking for the best places that can fit a digital nomad’s lifestyle, Asia and South America are two great continents\xa0to start looking into. To know more about the best countries see my article below:''» READ:''Best Countries in the World for Traveling & Working Nomads''It also helps to travel to visa-free countries at first. To check where you can go without the need of a visa see''VisaMap''or inquire at your local embassy.''»''How long?''It depends on\xa0where you’re planning on going\xa0since some visa-free countries applicable to your passport can enable you to stay indefinitely (by just\xa0applying for an extension); but\xa0for visa-required countries, the most that you can stay in is 3 months unless you apply for specialized visas like''Germany’s self-employment visa''or long-term residence visas.''» READ:''How to Legally Stay Longer in Europe''»''Where to stay?''AirBnB''is a favorite amongst travelers when it comes to\xa0long-term stays, whereas''Booking.com''is the best platform when you’re looking to\xa0book\xa0hotel stays (its system of ‘paying only after you check-out is very helpful since you can easily use your ‘bookings’ as''proof of accommodation''without the need of paying for it first. You can make a last minute cancellation too!).''TIP'':''Research the details of\xa0local rental websites in the city/town that you’re heading to since it’s possible that\xa0you could find better deals there.''For other ways of scoring cheap and free accommodation around the world, see this ultimate list:''» READ:''52 Ways to Get Cheap & Free Accommodation Around the World''///''How to Travel on a Budget''Now of course, as digital nomads, it’s vital that you inquire about a place’s internet connection.\xa0If attaining great internet in a certain accommodation proves to be futile (e.g. hotels, etc.), take note of the\xa0coworking spaces available in the city (you can use''CoWorking list''or''WorkFrom''for that,\xa0or simply ask around the digital nomad communities I previously mentioned.)''»''What to prepare?''FINANCIALS'': Securing a travel fund is a given but other than that, it’s important to\xa0figure out how your clients can pay you while you’re out traveling the world. If PayPal is needed, go set it up, connect it to your bank account or card, and so on. Personally though, I prefer using''TransferWise''because it has lower conversion and transfer fees compared to PayPal.''TIP'': It helps to have copies of your work portfolio on hand as well as bank statements and any other work-related documents\xa0if in case the immigration asks for it.''TAXES'': As a self-employed/freelancer individual or as a business owner. Now, I can’t provide one universal answer for this since every situation is different as dependent on your nationality or country of origin; so what I highly suggest is that if you’re ever in doubt, hire a consultant to help you sort out your tax documents. It also helps to organize this''waaaaay''beforehand since it can help with visa processes later on or even at the immigration itself to show your solvency or work.''(Customarily however,\xa0you pay taxes in your home country but once you stay in a foreign country for a longer period of time, make it a point to recheck your tax situation since it might be required for you to pay additional taxes to where you’re planning to stay in for long.)''VISAS'': This is self-explanatory. As already mentioned above, always check first if you need a tourist visa to\xa0the country that you’re heading to.''“''Do digital nomads need work visas instead?''” As a norm, entering\xa0a country with only a visitor visa is fine if you’re a digital nomad because\xa0you’re not really working\xa0 for a ‘physical business’ in that\xa0country’s territory (so you’re not illegally taking away the jobs\xa0of the locals etc.). Besides, most countries also don’t have clear regulations yet about digital nomads but it’s generally tolerated and allowed (irregardless, it\xa0is your responsibility to research the laws of the foreign\xa0country that you’re heading to\xa0since they\xa0might have\xa0different or new laws that goes against this concept.)''TIP'': When it comes to immigration, just\xa0say that you’re entering\xa0their country for tourism purposes. No need to say something like “''It will be my new base as a digital nomad''” since not a lot of people are that familiar yet with this line of work, and if you say something weird to their ears, they might\xa0minsinterpret your words and then forbid you to enter their country. But surely,\xa0if they ever ask about your work, it’s best to just mention that you are a self-employed freelancer or business owner (as dependent on the work that you do) and that you are paying tax and working for a company somewhere else. This will be an assurance to them that you’re not heading to their country to search for\xa0work (even though “technically” you’ll be working there, but only ‘online’ thereby not affecting the local employment).''» RELATED READ:''How to Travel the World on a Third World Passport''»''What\xa0do I need?''VACCINATIONS'': To check if you need to acquire\xa0certain vaccinations for your destination, check''CDC''.''INSURANCE'': I highly suggest''World Nomads''since they have great coverage for travelers like us!

It’s vital to talk about this because\xa0I always say this in my posts and I will never get tired of saying this: it REALLY helps to''“Always think long term.”''The''thing about basic digital nomad jobs like those listed above are that they still require hours of work and effort.

That’s why\xa0ideally, what you should aim for in years to come is to achieve a kind of digital nomad work that is''highly''sustainable — a kind of ‘enterprise’ that you personally own or run while only requiring a few hours of your time.''Examples of such ‘ultimate goals’ are:''Setting\xa0up an optimal\xa0online business that fits your remote lifestyle''Ex: I have my own''online business''now that I run together with my best friend.

As a result, I only work 3-4 hours a day or maybe even less). You can do something similar by signing up with Amazon or with eBay but I am warning you now that without proper mentorship and knowledge, this can be a tough business model to break in (we both managed to set up this\xa0business successfully because of the connections and mentorship that we had gained during\xa0our digital nomad lifestyle).''NOTE'': I just found out that there are''Amazon courses online''that can already teach you the basics of selling on Amazon.

In fact, if anyone would\xa0ever ask me to choose between a city trip or an outdoor trip, I\xa0would\xa0gladly pick the latter in a heartbeat!''So for the past years, I’ve been doing a lot of hiking as I traveled around Asia and Europe; however, there was a problem that I faced… Most of the outdoor clothing and footwear brands that I’ve tried\xa0had made me suffer several problems for numerous times (e.g. blisters, cold, bruises, etc.) no matter how careful I was with picking the right size and the right items.''It really proved challenging\xa0to find the right\xa0gear\xa0that would fit my needs perfectly…''until''Berghaus''came along.''With high-quality outdoor products that are manufactured with adventurers in mind, I was smitten at how this UK brand provided me with items that finally took away my hiking troubles. As a writer and blogger, I don’t like making statements that are not backed by real-life experiences so I am telling you this now: I’ve been wearing Berghaus’\xa0products\xa0to several hiking trips in\xa0the past months and NOT\xa0once have I had a problem with them. Needless to say, I’ve come to trust their brand wholly!''So if you\xa0are ever going on a hiking or walking trip in the future, below are the Berghaus outdoor clothing and equipment that you MUST have because they are worthy investments that can\xa0provide you the best comfort possible!''Guaranteed.''.''Berghaus Outdoor Clothing & Footwear for Hiking''TOP:''Hydroshell''™''Jackets''Apart from wearing the right kind of shirt underneath (either wool, fleece, or synthetic — definitely NOT cotton as it takes the heat away from your body especially when wet), it also helps to have an added outer layer against natural elements like wind, water, and dust. For this,\xa0Berghaus’ Hydroshell''™''Jackets are your best choice!''Built with advanced waterproof technology, their\xa0Hydroshell''™''range\xa0will keep you dry in whatever adventure while also providing\xa0ultimate comfort and protection.\xa0Berghaus has\xa0various types of Hydroshell''™''jackets available that are\xa0fit for alpine use\xa0and\xa0mountaineering but when it comes to simple and intermediate hikes, your best choice would be their ‘''Light Hike Hydroshell''™''Jacket''‘!''What’s to love about it?''100% Waterproof.''Not once did I get wet when wearing my Hydroshell''™''jacket and it makes sense because Berghaus has over 50 years of experience in making waterproof garments. Their fabric technology has been truly tested in the harshest conditions (even storm levels!); so for sure, I wasn’t surprised when I was well protected as\xa0I used it during a rainy day of hiking in Belgium.''Ergonomic Pockets & Features.''Great design for hiking afficionados: 2 big meshed pockets (for visibility and use), adjustable hood (with a firm upper frame\xa0for full vision and\xa0which\xa0can also be tucked away), velcro\xa0cuffs (to fit the opening on your hands), hem cord adjusters (for tighter fit), and an added small pouch\xa0(where you can stuff the whole of the jacket in and\xa0save space in your bag).''Enhanced Comfort with Ample Protection.''The fabric is absolutely breathable\xa0in order to help\xa0regulate your body temperature. Plus, with their comfort touch technology that has ARGENTUM® odor-resistant finish, you are assured of a more comfortable outdoor clothing wear experience. This means that it will not cling to your skin and it will keep you feeling fresh at all times! Rest assured,\xa0even with its light fabric material, I can tell you with confidence\xa0that it provides enough warmth too in case you use it in a more chilly environment.''Built to Last.''I have only been using the jacket for less than a year but I can already see how it can last for''more''given how it is built with prime materials. As a matter of fact, Berghaus\xa0stands by their\xa0product so much that they provide a lifetime guarantee\xa0to all of their customers — that’s how confident they are with their items!''DETAILS'':''Product Page''Weight of approximately\xa0282\xa0grams\xa0at $185~ (Php 8,700~)''BOTTOM:''Explorer ECO Zip Off Pants''When it comes to trousers for outdoor clothing, I like to have something that is not only comfortable but also ‘adaptable’. This means that I\xa0would like to have pants that can either be used in warm and cold conditions interchangeably — best if it’s a feature that is built in one pants so that I can also save space on my backpack.''Thankfully, Berghaus has their ECO Zip Off range that enables me to ‘zip off’ the lower leg part if in case the weather becomes warmer. Other properties to love about these trousers:''Water Repellent.''Made with ECO nylon fabric, it is\xa0not only treated with a durable water repellent finsish but it also offers sun protection of up to UPF 25+.''Comfortable Fit and Extra Pockets.''It has drawcord adjustments on the hem, belt loops, and waistband to ensure great fit.

Of course I thought I was buying the wrong sizes, but even if it were the most correct size for my feet, I still managed to get a blister or two somewhere on my foot. I was just about to accept the fact that I’m simply\xa0the kind of hiker that gets blisters no matter what… but I thought otherwise when the\xa0Berghaus’ Fellmaster® GTX® boots were given to me!''They were such\xa0a great\xa0fit\xa0and it\xa0was ridiculously\xa0comfortable as well. It didn’t give me blisters at all — not even during the\xa0first use, so you could imagine how ecstatic I was to have finally found the right boots for my adventures!''Recommended by The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, apparently, these boots were made\xa0with the best technology and performance materials available to provide a stylish yet modern boot that is rugged enough for high performance hiking. Its other features are as follows:''Pittards® British Quality Oiled Nubuck\xa0Leather.''This makes the boots soft,\xa0supple and well-cushioned, thereby providing all day comfort while remaining to be durable and abrasion resistant even\xa0during extended use.''Sturdy Outsole.''The Fellmaster® features a sturdy outsole that offers superb grip and support on all surfaces throughout your hike. I’ve use this in steep terrains for numerous times already and I can guarantee that it kept my feet fully secure, stable, and protected.''GORE-TEX® Performance Comfort Technology.''This helps prevents water entry and allows moisture to escape as well so that your feet stay dry and comfortable through and through.''DETAILS'':''Product Page''Weight of approximately 1,090\xa0grams at $206~ (Php 9,700~)''.''Overall''As a local, we all have those moments wherein we want to offload TONS\xa0of fun and interesting facts about our country to foreigners who might have misconceptions\xa0—\xa0or who might simply\xa0have no idea at all about certain facets of our history and society.''That’s why starting today, I\xa0am launching a series on this blog in which I will regularly feature 10 interesting facts for every country worldwide. The best part…? These articles will be written by the locals themselves; so needless to say, it will absolutely be authentic and legit.''As a monthly post, I will continue to invite various locals from all over the globe\xa0to talk about their home country! Surely there will be times that certain countries will have multiple\xa0contributors, but every\xa0writer will only talk about 10 things each and I will even ensure that the 10 points in each article will not\xa0be the same.''Now, I’m very excited about this because not only will it be an informational piece for you guys,\xa0but it will also be an informational piece for me! I just''LOVE''learning about other countries; so what better way than to ask\xa0the locals themselves, right?''To\xa0start off this series, I will of course start with myself as I talk about''the Philippines''— my beloved home country!''.''10 Things Foreigners Should Know About the Philippines''#1''– Geography & Safety''Officially known as the''Republic of the Philippines'', we are an archipelago in Southeast Asia located\xa0east of Vietnam and north of Malaysia. We have around 7,107 islands — of which only 2,000 are inhabited\xa0and these are categorized broadly under 3 divisions: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao (with Manila as the capital that is located in Luzon).''Speaking of Mindanao,''past incidents''made by radical groups\xa0in these southern islands have given foreigners\xa0the false impression that it is not safe to travel to the Philippines; but such is NOT\xa0true! Those were isolated and special cases, and are definitely not the norm. In fact, one of the cities in Mindanao called as Davao has a very low crime rate and is even claimed to be one of the safest cities in Asia.''But okay, there is still crime in the country but much like any Asian destination,\xa0it’s not so serious nor threatening as long as you stay street smart.''TRIVIA ABOUT SAFETY'':''We love''Manny Pacquiao''with a passion. We are fiercely proud and supportive of him that during his fights, most (if not ALL) of us will be at home or in public places watching the TV and cheering him on. Because of this,\xa0you will see two dominant\xa0‘''miracles''‘ happening across the country: non-existent traffic\xa0and\xa0ridiculously low crime rate (''dropping to below 1%'').''Trust me, it’s true. To illustrate:\xa0back in 2011 rebels and government soldiers had a ceasefire as they''came together''and watch Manny’s fight.''As for\xa0weather and natural occurrences, the Philippines mainly has two seasons: dry and wet. Dry season\xa0starts in late November and ends in May, and the wet season primarily starts in June until October. If you’re in one of the big cities like Manila, be wary when it rains too hard since floods primarily happen due to poor irrigation and sewage infrastructure.\xa0Additionally, given how\xa0we’re close to the equator, the Philippines is also prone to\xa0earthquakes and typhoons — rest assured, they don’t happen that often to make you get all anxious about traveling here.''#2''–\xa0The People & Our Pride''With a population of about 100 million, we are the 7th-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world (with an additional 12 million of Filipinos who live and work overseas — these workers are commonly called ‘''OFWs''‘ or Overseas Filipino Workers).''For the record, we’re called Filipinos — NOT ‘Philipinos’. (Females can be specifically called as Filipinas).''We also call ourselves Pinoys which you should pronounce as P-noy (with a short ‘P’) and not ‘Pee-noy’. In connection\xa0with this word, we often like to say this phrase: “''Proud to be Pinoy''” or “''Pinoy Pride''” especially when\xa0we see any international celebrity or rising star who even has the slightest hint of Filipino blood in their body… Okay maybe not often:''always.''This is why there\xa0is this running joke on the internet that whenever someone popular worldwide has a quarter or a tiny hint of Filipino ancestry, people will start saying things like: “''Brace yourselves, the proud Filipinos are coming.''” Haha! But of course, it helps to note that some of us are also tired whenever our fellowmen keep claiming just about''anyone''who might be related to our ancestry.''On the other hand, though we are very proud of ourselves and our country, we are''VERY''sensitive''as well. We got no chill\xa0especially when it’s something bad about us\xa0— this means that\xa0if you ever have anything bad to say about the Philippines or our fellow countrymen, HELL WILL BREAK LOOSE ON YOU. Guaranteed. Examples:''Teri Hatcher'', an actress from the show Desperate Housewives, who made a comment about Filipino nurses on the show had enraged Filipinos,\xa0and our government even demanded an apology from her.''(Yes, even if it was just a fictional show and that the screenwriters\xa0were the ones who have made her say that).''Actress''Claire Danes''was declared as a''persona-non grata''in 1998 when she made ‘bad’ comments about Manila after shooting a movie there called as Breakdown Palace. I’m not sure if up till today she’s still declared as so.''In 2012,''Justin Bieber''who is not a Pacquiao-''belieber''ridiculed Manny Pacquiao\xa0in 2012 after he lost a fight to Juan Manuel Marquez by posting a series of photos that mocked his knockout loss. Naturally, a huge number of\xa0Filipinos\xa0went mad about that and some lawmakers even filed for a request to demand an apology from the singer or else he’ll be declared as a''persona-non grata''too. Pacquiao on the other hand, just didn’t care and said that he’ll pray for Bieber.''(Seemingly though, we mostly only get mad if the comments are made by foreigners since if it’s a fellow Filipino that’s joking or making a comment, we normally just brush it off.)''By the way, if I may add, even in the blogging scene, people are saying\xa0that some bloggers make''intentional''bad comments and articles online about the Philippines just to enrage the Filipinos and get more traffic or worldwide attention. (Now guys, don’t take advantage of us, okay?)''NOTE:''Rest assured, not everyone in the country is this touchy, but yeah… generally, as you can see, the majority\xa0are.''#3''– Happiness & Mentality''On the other end of the spectrum however, we are''VERY''friendly and happy people. No matter if\xa0most of us\xa0Filipinos\xa0are poor, we are recognized as one of the world’s happiest nations and it’s mainly because…''we just are.''We always try to look for the silver lining behind any dire situation. We make the best out of things!\xa0No matter what misfortunes we may have — lack of money, floods, crazy typhoones, etc. — our positivity shines through. I guess we know full well the phrase: “''Sh*t just happens.''” so we move on and continue to persevere.''Sounds too good to be true?\xa0You’ll know what I mean when you get here.''Moreover, we also''LOVE''foreigners and we love it even more if you visit our country and fall in love with it. We absolutely\xa0have colonial mentality and that’s because we were colonized by white people for a very long time (Spaniards for 377 years and Americans for 48 years) yet\xa0in the end, it’s the Americans that we have developed a really soft spot for.''I say this because if you’re an American or white person who visits the country, you will notice a LOT of things:''You will be treated like a KING.\xa0You’ll experience prime service and friendliness (but this is not to say that Filipinos are not warm and friendly to each other and to any other race, because we are — it just so happens that most people go to the extreme when dealing with white people).''You can\xa0become an instant celebrity (mostly in the more rural areas) as people flock to you, ogle, take pictures, or\xa0try their English.''Strangers\xa0calling you: “Joe” in a friendly way is a common thing even if you might not in fact be, American. We also use\xa0the term “Kano” for Americans which derives from the word ‘Amerikano’.''One example of a\xa0drawback to this though is that since they know that you’re a foreigner, you’ll sometimes\xa0be charged way over the normal price or even be scammed; so it’s best to be informed about the typical\xa0prices beforehand.''Nevertheless,\xa0despite all this''special treatment'', remember:''DON’T''let it get to your head. I’ve met and seen a lot of white people who become too arrogant after knowing this fact,\xa0but please don’t be one of those people because we do NOT worship just about every white individual\xa0—\xa0a large portion of the population\xa0just simply''admire''them. Besides, like I mentioned in the previous number, if you ‘wrong’ us we will not hesitate to go against you.''NOTE'': This favoritism can\xa0also be\xa0observed with Filipinos’ intense desire for whiter skin. You will even notice that most of our celebrities\xa0have mixed native Filipino and white ancestry, or have fair white skin.''#4''–\xa0Catholicism''We are a secular state but Christianity is the dominant faith. As of 2011, about 80% of the population are Catholics (with Islam as the 2nd largest) and we are also\xa0the''3rd largest Catholic country''in the world in terms of numbers. (This is why\xa0sometimes, foreigners that I’ve met are very surprised when they meet Filipinos like me who are atheists).''Given these facts, it’s no news that our church (or our faith — since as you can see, most Filipinos are Catholics) has an EXTREME\xa0influence not only in\xa0the political scene but even in the social and personal lives of everyone.''EXAMPLES'': Most of the citizens are still''very''conservative, divorce is still not allowed, abortion is still viewed as immoral, and even the\xa0Reproductive Health Law that guarantees free access to contraceptives for all citizens was\xa0fiercely opposed by the church for over''14 YEARS''until it was finally passed as a bill in 2012 and approved in 2014. Naturally, up until today, the church still opposes it.''I guess the only''irony''about this is that even if\xa0we are fiercely religious, the majority\xa0have no problems with gays or transexuals in the country\xa0—\xa0which we have a LOT of. Certainly, being\xa0‘pro-gay’\xa0hints\xa0that we are also progressive and\xa0I find this as a good thing, but of course there are still people who look down on it or could not tolerate it.''#5''–\xa0Language''There are approximately 180\xa0languages and dialects in the Philippines but there are two official languages:''English''and''Filipino''(standardized version of Tagalog).''This means that the country is very tourist-friendly — well, provided that you, as a tourist, knows how to speak English. But of course, there are some parts of the Philippines\xa0that can’t speak fluent English (or even Filipino/Tagalog) but almost everyone can understand and utter simple English no matter if they have little to no education.''Besides, as connected to the colonial mentality that we have, we are proud of how we can speak English\xa0(some people even go as far as forcing, if not learning, a U.S. accent).''TRIVIA'':''We have a really competent English-speaking workforce that’s why we have a LOT of call centers in the country. Koreans normally flock to our country to learn English as well! Moreover, because of how almost everyone in the country speaks English, most expats don’t bother learning Filipino/Tagalog.''#6''–\xa0Transportation''Photo by''Jeff Jacinto''via Flickr / CC''We have nice expressways but\xa0relatively, our overall transportation infrastructure is underdeveloped. We also have the worst traffic. (We, of course, blame the government for that).''Anyhow, one of the most popular modes of public transportation in the Philippines are the jeepneys which we also often use as a symbol for the country. These were originally made or inspired out from''US military jeeps''that were left behind after World War II. Today, they are decorated flamboyantly in various colors! Though they act like buses, they are not air-conditioned and they\xa0can stop just about ANYWHERE\xa0for as long as you say “''Para!”''(“Stop!”).''The next most common public transport vehicle are tricycles which are motorcycles that have an attached side car for passengers\xa0— these are basically like taxis that can take you to anywhere you want. There are also the pedicabs which are similar to rickshaws given how they operate by cycling.''FYI'': For a jeepney ride,\xa0Php 8.00 (pesos or $0.18) is the minimum fare; more is added after 4 kms. As for tricycles, it’s usually at Php 12.00 — less if you share with other persons whereas pedicabs are more costly. For taxis, the flag-down base rate should be Php 40.00 ($0.85) so it’s really cheap especially if you come from a developed country.''#7''–\xa0Concept of Family''Below photo by''Mommysaurus75''via Flickr / CC''Another thing that you should know about the Philippines is that,\xa0family is''VERY''important\xa0and almost every family is close. But this ‘closeness’ is not just limited between the parents and the children because it also includes the relatives!''Some other facts:''You will often see extended families in Filipino homes and every celebration can be really festive since\xa0almost all the members under the\xa0family tree can\xa0be present! (Christmas, New Year, birthdays, etc. with the ever present karaoke spree.)\xa0You’ll best see this if you can manage to stay in with a Filipino family; so maybe\xa0try''couchsurfing''or a homestay? Then again,\xa0once you befriend a Filipino, you’ll most likely be invited to one\xa0of their happenings.''It’s normal for sons and daughters to stay at home with their parents even after they are 18, and most of the time, parents have a strong ‘say’ about their children’s future. It’s not surprising to see people following a university course or doing a job that’s dictated by their parents.''Once the children\xa0are married, they are free to choose to stay in with their parents or separate. Anyhow, there is this saying that, “When you marry a Filipino, you marry the whole family.” and that’s so true!''We respect our parents a lot\xa0so even the idea of sending them to a nursing home\xa0is unthinkable. Most of the time it’s the eldest of the family or the child who is the most ‘well-off’ who takes the parents in until they pass.''More about respect, we usually attach an appropriate title for those who are older than us, like “Ate” or “Tita” for girls or “Kuya” and “Tito” for guys (example: “Ate Aileen” or “Kuya Jonas”). We also add the word “''po''” at the end of our sentences when we are talking to elders.''Plus, every time we meet our elders we do a “''mano''” gesture which is a sign of respect and an acceptance of their ‘blessing’ (we put the hand of the elder to our forehead — see photo on the side to see how it’s done).''#8''– A\xa0Social Media Capital''There was a time that the Philippines was dubbed as the “Text Capital of the World” as 35 million people send about 450 million text messages daily. Today, we are\xa0being dubbed as the\xa0“Social Media Capital of\xa0the World” or the “Most Social Nation” as well\xa0given how we have the most active users on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. (Time magazine had even previously titled us as the “Selfie Capital of the World”.)''This claim fully supports the incidences previously mentioned in point #2 because\xa0we can easily make our voices heard all over the world if we ever feel the need to say something about some people or some issues. What does this mean for you? Nothing much really, but it’s a nice fact to know. I guess the things you’ll just have to prepare for are frequent instances of picture-taking and Filipinos adding you up in their Facebook accounts — “accounts” because some people have a Facebook account for home, another one for work, another for friends, etc.''To even better display our''power''in social media, just look up on the “''AlDub''” social media phenomenon\xa0that’s still currently going on in the country. Over the past months, the hashtag #ALDUB\xa0had a record-breaking performance on\xa0Twitter as it trended with over 25.6 million tweets in just one day! Today, it continues to trend over at Twitter that programs like BBC and Bloomberg have taken notice.''#9''–\xa0It’s\xa0More Fun Here! (+ Inexpensive)''You’ve probably heard of the phrase “''It’s more fun in the Philippines!''“,\xa0a successful campaign of our Department of Tourism as it promotes the beauty of the country — and you should totally believe this\xa0claim. We have TONS of amazing things to offer you\xa0such as\xa0white sand beaches, pristine islands, exotic locations, turquoise waters and more! Simply put: we are an underrated South East Asian destination and you must know that we are the epitome of your tropical dreams! ;)''Remember: there’s more to the Philippines than the widely-known Boracay and the urban Manila. And don’t worry about traveling inter-island because almost all of the islands are well connected (the only problem you’ll probably encounter is that it may take time to get from point A to point B since boat or bus rides can take a while).''As for costs, we have budget airlines that regularly hold promos thereby giving you rock-bottom prices that \xa0can be as low as $10 for a one-way flight. Cost of living can cost around\xa0$700 per month in the big cities and can go lower if you go to the more rural areas. (Our currency is\xa0the Philippine Peso [Php] and\xa0your $1 can already amount to around Php 45.00 which can already buy you a meal).''#10''–\xa0Early Christmas Celebration''Since it’s the holiday season at the time of this post, why not expose you to a Christmas-related fun fact about the Philippines?\xa0You see, apart from the ‘Holy Week’, Christmas is another event\xa0that we''LOVE''to do and we usually start celebrating it as early as''September''and ends sometime in January. Yes, you read it right: September!''People will start saying stuff like “''-Ber months are here!''” claiming that the weather is slowly getting ‘chillier’ (when it fact it’s not) and then public +\xa0private establishments will start setting up Christmas decorations. You will also start to hear\xa0Christmas songs being played in the malls or on the radio! Yes, it is''that''festive.''Things we do during this season:''Simbang Gabi''(Night Mass) where Catholics attend\xa0masses from December 16 to 24 and these occur at various times (as early as 03:00 AM!!). This is a way of\xa0honoring the Virgin Mary and also a way of anticipating the coming Christmas Day.''On the last day of the Night Masses (''Misa de Gallo''), Filipino families will get together to celebrate Noche Buena as they eat a''BIG''feast —''‘lechon''‘ or roasted suckling pig is almost always the center of this occasion.''The whole Christmas celebration ends on the 1st Sunday of January as we celebrate the Feast of the Three Kings.''.''Overall''…It’s that time of the year again!''And since this season is all about spreading joy, love and appreciation, I would like to share the task of good ol’ Santa and bring you an exciting gift right before the year ends!''You see, this blog has been alive for only a year, but a LOT of things have happened.

Of course, the usual solution for this is to wear earmuffs, but my problem with this is that even\xa0if it helps a lot in keeping my ears warm, I hated the ‘''band''‘ part of it across my head. Because no matter how I buy an earmuff that fits me perfectly, it tends to give off a tight feeling after a while,\xa0so it ends up being an uncomfortable wear.''The owners of Sprigs knew about this existing\xa0problem that’s why\xa0they set out to create their patented''Earbags''®''. These are bandless ear warmers that you can wrap around each of your ears easily and it will stay on snugly and —''best of all''— comfortably!''The first time that I saw this, I was\xa0flabbergasted that I didn’t discover it sooner\xa0— I really love it!

It has an area of around 90 km''2''which is somehow huge; BUT the main town itself is quite small and can be walked in whole within\xa0just less than an hour!''TRIVIA'': In the past, due to its strategic location on the Meuse, Dinant was often exposed to battle and pillage so it naturally follows that this area\xa0is quite packed with history and fortresses.''Things to Do & See''» Walk or Cruise Down the River Meuse''The River Meuse is a major European river that rises from France, flowing through Belgium and the Netherlands until it trickles into the North Sea. So given how Dinant ‘sparkles’ along this river body, it’s a must to bask in its beauty! You can choose to walk or lounge beside the Meuse, or you can enjoy a cruise to take in all of the breathtaking scenery.''For rates and availability, it’s best to check''Evasion.be''for more information. We visited here this November and the cruises weren’t in season (as they’re typically available during April and October); but it was fine, since we already enjoyed walking by the riverside. Besides, it was also too cold and I don’t think I would have enjoyed a river cruise if there was one at the time.''.''» Collégiale Notre Dame de Dinant''.''.''Said to be the landmark of Dinant, this Collegiate Church of Our Lady\xa0is a 13th-century Gothic cathedral which has an iconic 16th-century pear-shaped bell tower.''It’s truly a lovely structure in itself that’s even perfectly backdropped by the cliff behind it where the town’s citadel sits.''» Citadelle de Dinant''Built in 1815, this fortress overlooks the city of Dinant and is part of the so-called ‘Meuse Citadels’ (with the two others located in Huy and Namur). To go up this cultural hotspot, you can either walk up the 405 steps or take the cable car that costs around 11 EUR. It’s well worth your time to visit this place since it does not only have an Arms Museum but it will also reward you with a great aerial view of Dinant!''.''» Charles de Gaulle Bridge''.''The main bridge in Dinant is called as ‘Charles De Gaulle’ to commemorate\xa0of the presence of Charles de Gaulle himself\xa0—\xa0a previous president of the French Republic\xa0—\xa0when\xa0he was shot in the leg during\xa0the major battle in Dinant back in August 1914. Last 2014 which was the 100th anniversary of World War I, they have put up a statue of Charles\xa0at\xa0the foot of the bridge as a way of celebrating their association with him''(which is somehow ironic and odd).''Now it’s not hard to find this bridge because today,\xa0it is lined with funky saxophones that are\xa0individually designed with each of the European Union members in mind.\xa0This was done in tribute to Adolphe Sax, the inventor of the saxophone who happened to have been born here in Dinant.''(If you ask me, it fits better to call this the Saxophone Bridge.)''.''» Maison de Monsieur Sax''Speaking of Adolphe Sax, even if he\xa0had only lived in this town\xa0for a year before his family moved to Brussels and then to Paris,\xa0Dinant\xa0didn’t want to miss the opportunity of claiming him as their “son” and even celebrating his achievements with such''gusto!''Therefore, gigantic saxophones are not only found on the Charles de Gulle bridge, but can also be found on certain areas around the city.\xa0To add, they have even set up an open museum to Sax in the location where his family’s original home\xa0used to be and it’s named as the''Maison de Monsieur Sax''. (Right outside this place, you will even see a bronze sculpture of Sax himself who is sitting on a bench, ‘waiting’ for someone to do a photo op with him!)''TIP:''If you want to have an interactive musical experience, head on to the''Maison de la Pataphonie''(House of Pataphony) located in the street of Rue En Rhee – 51.\xa0It’s a 15th-century hosue that’s been renovated into a series of rooms wherein you can play with the instruments that are made of household items!''.''» Maison Leffe''Well of course, since we’re in Belgium, there has to be a musuem somewhere that’s dedicated to beer, and it is here in Maison Leffe that you can have the chance to take in the history of how Leffe was made — which is one of the most-known Belgian Trappist beers.''In this hotel-slash-museum, you can do a self-guided tour that will show you the beer-making process and the life of a Trappist Monk. To finish up the 7 EUR entrance fee, you will also get to have a bear-tasting spree and a gift as well!''For more information about this, go to''Leffe.com''.''» Rocher Bayard''Photo by''Myben.be''via Flickr / CC''Located between Dinant and Anseremme, the Bayard Rock is a spectacular rocky needle that is about 40 meters high and this… was quite a sight! Legend has it that it\xa0was formed when it was split by the hoof of Bayard, a giant magical horse that carried the 4 sons of Aymon (an ancient epic).''…In reality however,\xa0there used to be a small hole in between these rocks and it was split open by the soldiers of Louis XIV when they were trying to invade Dinant.''.''» Castle of Freÿr''Photo by''Jean-Pol GRANDMONT''via Wikipedia / CC''Said to be a mini version of France’s Versailles, this castle is one of the most magnificent sites in Belgium and is even one of Wallonia’s major heritage sites!\xa0Nestled on the left bank of the Meuse between Waulsort and Dinant, this castle is certainly impressive not only for its architecture but also for its terraced garden that is so wonderfully-designed. (Just look at that!)''.''» Outdoor Adventures''Now of course, since we’re in the south of Belgium (that’s more hilly and speckled with more lush forests) you must not miss out on the outdoor adventures that are available. Besides, if you go down near Anseremme, you will find a lot of providers that offer nature walks, kayaking, cross country cycling, ziplines, rock climbing, and more!''Jonas and I, however, took it upon ourselves to try two things given the time that we have: cave exploration and hiking. There are several caves and hiking trails in the area\xa0to choose from, and since we are the kind of couple that’s into random and spontaneous activities,\xa0we ended up exploring''Grotte de Dinant''(as it was the first that we saw) and a random hiking trail somewhere near Anseremme.''End result:''it was amazing.''We loved the limestone formations in the cave of''Grotte de Dinant''and our random hiking trail had even led us to great spots that are clad with stunning cliffs and colorful autumn trees.''To get a better glimpse of our adventure, come watch my vlog below!''.''» EVENT: Bathtub Regatta''If you’re looking to attend a very''quirky''yet traditional event in Belgium, then Dinant’s Bathtub Regatta is something that you shouldn’t miss! As the name suggests, it’s exactly what you think it is: a regatta in which people race in bathtubs that can only be propelled by human force. (Yep, that’s how it goes!)''The bathtubs are often decorated in line with the year’s theme and it’s really wacky. Unfortunately, we didn’t manage to see this event since it was only held during the 15th of August. With that in mind, you bet that I will be scheduling my attendance for next year!''.''» FOOD:\xa0Must-Try''Couque de Dinant'':\xa0a sweet biscuit that’s native to Dinant, and apparently, this is Europe’s hardest biscuit!''And boy, they were right!''It leaves me to think that this is rather best for decoration than for eating… But when you do manage to dissolve and eat it (which I did) it’s quite good.''Flamiche Dinantaise'':\xa0This is much like the French quiche but here in Dinant, they make it with a special low-fat cheese called as''Boulette de Romedenne.''.''How to Get to Dinant''By train.''From either Namur or Brussels, you can easily reach Dinant in just 1.5 hours and the stop is conveniently located in the other side of the river which is just a 5-minute walk away from the city center.''By car.''This is how we got to Dinant, and thanks to Belgium’s excellent motorway system, it was easy to reach it by car.\xa0Just follow the A4 motorway and you will easily find signs that will lead you to Dinant. If you’re from Brussels, it will just be an hour’s drive away; but since we are currently based in Antwerp, it took us around 2 hours.''By plane.''The closest airports are Brussels, Charleroi (Brussels South Charleroi Airport) and Liège.''NOTE:''Once you’re in town, there’s no need to be concerned about getting around since as I’ve mentioned, Dinant is a very small (cute!) city. Though if you have to reach places like the Castle Freyr, you would have to ride the bus, or you can opt to walk too, but\xa0it would be like 6km away.''Where to Stay in Dinant''Given the size of the town there are only around a handful of hotels in the city and what I would highly recommend is''Ibis Hotel''which is the highest-rated accommodation in Dinant. We stayed here during the duration of our trip and it was pleasant; I especially loved how it was\xa0located just by the river!''For other choices, feel free to browse through''Booking.com''for the best price!''.''Booking Essentials''Booking.com''Overall''I bet you’ve heard a lot of stories about travelers who get their travel packs destroyed, slashed, or stolen while they are on the road. These instances are often\xa0unavoidable especially when you’re\xa0careless, or simply when\xa0bad luck decides to knock on your door\xa0— truth be told,\xa0I have experienced\xa0being robbed and slashed''a couple of times in the past\xa0when I was still traveling in\xa0South East Asia with a backpack. Despite all of that,\xa0I just knew that there has to be a travel pack out there that\xa0can fully prevent theft from happening!''So\xa0for some time now, I have been on the search for the most secure pack\xa0for travelers,\xa0and when Numinous Packs offered me a chance to review their new anti-theft backpacks, I gladly took them up on their offer. Currently, they offer four variations for all types of travelers: 25L Day Pack, 55L Travel Pack, 65L Travel Pack, and 80L Wheeled Luggage,\xa0and\xa0they were very generous for giving me samples of the\xa0first three types.''Now, like most of the reviews that I do for this blog, I don’t just post and recommend products carelessly without thoroughly testing them out first; that’s why,\xa0I have actually been using the products\xa0for several months now.''My final verdict?''I love the Numinous Packs!''Why…?''.''Why I Love Numinous Travel Packs''» Maximum protection due to\xa0Kevlar Anti-Slash Technology''The Numinous Packs are made of material that implements their Kevlar Anti-Slash technology which is 5x stronger than steel! What this means is that thieves won’t be able to slash your bag so easily —\xa0which is quite a common thing that they do.''So in retrospect, with Numinous Packs, you are somehow carrying a steel travel pack (that’s lighter, of course!) thereby giving no one the chance to slash your bag open and access your belongings. I have tried slashing the bags myself in one corner and I can guarantee you, no knife can easily get through these packs!''To add, not only is it water-resistant but the backpack also has a patented flap zip protection system (to cover the zippered areas), giving potential thieves a hard time accessing your bag whenever you’re mobile or on transit.''»\xa0Feature of Anti-Puncture Zipper Technology''I have once been a victim of thieves accessing my bag by puncturing through my zipper by probably using a pen or some tool. That’s why I was happy to hear when the Numinous Packs had this technology to combat that!\xa0I have tried my best to push through the zippers with a pen and I was unsuccessful; which is absolutely good news.''»\xa0TSA & Travel Sentry-Approved 3 Digit Dial Combination Locks''This is a feature that I love because it’s no news that airports can decide to inspect your luggage if they find the need to, and when they do so, your luggage may end up damaged as they pry it open\xa0if you don’t have a TSA-Approved lock. TSA locks\xa0may be predominantly used and needed when\xa0in the USA, but it’s said that the Travel Sentry system is\xa0also used by airport security around the world — which Numinous Packs have. Therefore, this is a very helpful feature!''To know how to use the locks on Numinous Packs, see the video below:''»\xa0Shield Protection Dual Combination Lock''As a traveler, there’s often a need to leave your backpack elsewhere, may it be in your hostel dorm, in the train you’re riding, etc. To give you the peace of mind whenever you’re separated from your Numinous Pack, they have also included a lock in the travel pack that enables you to securely fasten it to any fixed object using a retractable wire lock. It’s absolutely useful!''»\xa0Full Length Front-Loading Opening''When choosing a backpack, there are typically two types:''top-loading and front-loading''.''Top-loading backpacks are those typical backpacks that are like a rugsack wherein you pack your things vertically through one opening. So if you have travel pack that is larger than 25L, you can imagine how difficult it could be to organize your things. Like for example, if you want to locate a shirt that you want to wear that is at the bottom of your bag, you might have to unpack and repack everything just so you can get the item that you need!''That’s why often times, a front-loading backpack is preferred since it functions like a suitcase wherein you can lie it down and open it up so \xa0that you can see everything in detail. And this is why I loved Numinous Packs because they integrated this feature perfectly! When Jonas and I used these backpacks during our''road trip''in the south of Germany and Austria, we never had problems locating our stuff since it was such an ergonomic pack.\xa0As for the other features that it has:''Interior compression straps: so that you can keep everything in place.''Ergonomic design for maximum comfort: it will keep your things condensed and close to your back which will help lessen the strain on your back and shoulder.''Extra pockets: combination of zippered and mesh pockets to hold your other stuff.''For the 25L Day Pack:''the inside of the bag includes one big zippered pocket and a separate padded pocket for your laptop.''»\xa0Fully-Adjustable Back System to accommodate users of all shapes and sizes''When I first ordered my Numinous samples, I was intrigued with how the travel packs\xa0didn’t have any specifications for the height of either male or females for fitting. That’s when I learned that such was unnecessary because they have an amazing back system which you can fully adjust to ensure your comfort while carrying the backpacks.''It also has a padded lumbar support system with enough airflow circulation to further ensure your comfortability! For sure, it’s very thick and intricate, yet not so harrowing to my shoulders. When I carried my 55L, I was a bit scared at first because once it’s\xa0full, it will be on par with my weight (yep, there you go, now you know my weight LOL) and I might have a hard time carrying it. However, I was surprised when it didn’t stress me so much.''*Rest assured, whenever you’re going to stow away the Numinous Packs somewhere during transit (for instance), they have included a full-zippered cover feature so that you can conceal this back panel system easily.''»\xa0Extras and Quick-Access Compartments''Side carry handle for ease of loading''Extra external compression straps''Mesh side pockets''Front compartment with:''2 big zippered pockets''Secure padded laptop compartment''»\xa0They “give back”''When you purchase a Numinous Pack, you will be directly helping the ‘African Children’s Fund’ since every purchase that you make will help African children to gain not only education but food and nourishment.''» The''CONS'', however are:''Aesthetic Design''– this was the first ‘con’ that I saw when I saw the Numinous packs. Though the design is sleek and modern, it’s not so aesthetically pleasing to the eye especially with the big numbers on front. Also, as of this moment, it’s only available in gray color so there’s no available variety for anyone who might want other colors.''Cost''– if you’re on a budget, this could be a tough purchase to make. (The 25L is at $130, 55L at $300, 65L at $315, and 80L at $450.) But I assure you that with the superb comfort and security that Numinous pack offers, it’s well WORTH the hefty price. Besides, it’s better to invest on this than to regret it later when you lose your possessions.''Availability''–\xa0As of this moment, the Numinous Packs are only available in the US, Canada and UK but they are definitely working on making it available in other countries.''Overall''I’ve been''traveling for almost 3 years''now and a lot of people have been asking me how I have managed to keep fit despite such a''haphazard''lifestyle. I usually answer this kind of question with irony and hints\xa0of embarrassment''(I’m still bad at handling compliments)''but after yet another email from a reader the other day, I thought that it’s finally time for me to\xa0get over my coyness. That’s why now, I’m putting up\xa0a post\xa0about it as I\xa0officially answer this question once and for all.''But first, let me just say that\xa0this ‘''how to stay fit’''post is not here to tell you to be thin (I’m just here to tell you to be healthy). Nor am I here to tell you that I am the kind of person who has divine abs\xa0and\xa0a rocking ass (woot, I wish I have those!). I’m not even\xa0a freak of workouts because\xa0despite the fact that\xa0I am\xa0fit,\xa0I’m not insanely muscled or toned — which is fine because as long as I’m healthy, that’s enough for me.''But of course with that in mind, this doesn’t mean that I have managed to stay fit like this with no effort at all and with due thanks to a crazy metabolism rate (nope, I don’t have that either), because I''always''put effort and I''still''get unfit if I let myself go. Therefore,\xa0even if\xa0I lack the discipline to form rock hard abs, I rather\xa0have the discipline to\xa0stick to some habits and routines in order to maintain my current healthy\xa0form — and I’m going to share those tips\xa0with you!''Besides,\xa0I still and always will care for my health AND\xa0my body. I’m not going to spew B.S. or\xa0lies and tell you that I don’t care about how I look, because''I do''. Let’s face it: we all\xa0care and\xa0it’s absolutely fine to care\xa0about your physical state\xa0as long as it doesn’t get''waaaay''into your head\xa0(making\xa0you into some sort of overly vain\xa0person) and as long as\xa0it’s not your only\xa0motivation.''You see,\xa0I simply chose\xa0to try and stay fit because it makes me feel better, and it''does''make me better, mentally and physically. I’ve seen enough real life horror stories and I don’t want none of that — I want to live a long life and avoid diseases for as much as I could!''So… how do I stay fit while I travel?''I simply form a routine\xa0as I ensure to make\xa0good choices\xa0—\xa0if not pick the lesser evil\xa0— in whatever I do or consume. Mind you, I don’t do any strict dieting\xa0program,\xa0so rest assured, the steps below are things that you can also easily execute in order to\xa0maintain your well-being as you travel! Here we go…''.''How to Stay Fit While Traveling''#1 – Always Choose to ‘Go’\xa0by Foot''WALK:''Avoid the urge to take the nearest bus, tram or train to get to your next destination if in case it’s just a few kilometers away.''Don’t''give in — just put on some comfy shoes and do it by foot! Through this way,\xa0you\xa0will get some exercise AND\xa0you will also save some money from your travel fund.''Other than\xa0doing your own ‘tour’, look for''FREE''walking\xa0tours in the city that you’re in! There are a LOT of them out there and a quick Google search will easily lead you to one.''I know that the''walkalator''in the airport looks so tempting, but don’t get lazy. Walk with your own might! It might not seem much, but small efforts can do a lot if put all together.''Do night walks too. It’s an amazing experience\xa0and it’s one of my favorite things to do whenever I’m in a new place. There are scenes at night that can make everything look so magical so try it out from time to time!''If your flight is delayed, instead of waiting in your seat, choose\xa0the act of doing a stroll around the airport.''.''TAKE THE STAIRS:''I know the feeling of laziness that overwhelms you whenever you see a flight of stairs in sight. I get that all the time! But I always try to remember what ‘Nike’ would say:''Just. Do. It.''Taking the stairs\xa0is truly a great way to do cardio and a great way to build your body strength! Besides, choosing to\xa0do it\xa0often leaves you with less of a crowd (…in every city that I’ve been to, almost no one takes the stairs if there’s a nearby escalator or elevator).''Taking the steps\xa0one at a time burns a lot of\xa0calories\xa0but\xa0if you want to develop better muscles that can help burn more calories for you in the future, it often helps to do''two steps at a time''.''If you want a total workout, you can run up and down a flight of stairs for 20-30 minutes! It’s tiring but the payoff is absolutely great. You can either do this in your''hotel or hostel'', or in any landmark or attraction that has stairs.''.''HIKE:''The thing about''hiking''is that it’s not only an effective workout but it’s also a great opportunity\xa0for experiencing and seeing new sceneries in your destination (especially if the area is centered more to nature and the outdoors). Truth be told, doing such an activity\xa0may even make you feel like you’re not working out at all.''.''RUN:''This is but another great way\xa0for exploring the new area that’s around you and it’s often called as a ‘sightseeing run’. So try to make it into a routine to break out into a run at some point in your day (''early morning''is typically best so that you can leave the rest of the day for your other travel activities).''I love using the app''RunKeeper.com''for tracking my runs. Come try it out too!''If you’re in the\xa0beach, for a more intense ‘run’, try to do it ankle deep in the water.''.''#2 – Be Resourceful. Take Advantage of Workout Possibilities Around You''HOTEL GYM:''This is common knowledge,\xa0but try to keep this in mind because I know how easy it can be to overlook it. From my experience, there have been so many instances in the past wherein I ignore the gym in the hotel that I’m staying in just because I’m having too much of a good time. But I always remind myself now that with my travel lifestyle, it’s hard to find the right equipment while\xa0on the road so I should take advantage of a fitness center (even more so when it’s free!) whenever I’m near one — so you should too!''.''LOCAL ACTIVITIES:''Ever see people playing football in a field? Or a group of people practicing Zumba or Tai Chi in a park? Or have you heard of a yoga retreat happening nearby you? Go and\xa0ask them if you could join! Through this way, you’ll meet a lot of the locals too, which will make for good travel memories and stories. There have been so many times that I met interesting people by asking them if I could join their game — most of which happened on the beach since I love joining a good match of beach volleyball!''.''PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS:''Apart from reliving your childhood by enjoying the swings and slides, I mentioned this\xa0because there are times wherein these places have makeshift workout equipments that can give you a good workout time. So go and try out the pullbars, weights, skipping ropes, etc… anything that you can find!''» Basically the main idea of this section is to remind you that there are a lot of things around us that can help us execute a good exercise. How to stay fit, you say? You just need to be resourceful and open at all times!''.''#3 – Opt to Be Active''INDOOR &\xa0UTDOOR\xa0ADVENTURES:''Biking, skiing, swimming, snorkeling, wall climbing, and so many more! There are tons of activities that you can try while you travel and it helps to pick active''itineraries''to keep your blood pumping.''Surely,\xa0if you’re naturally adventurous, this tip would come as a natural response\xa0to you so it won’t feel like such a ‘workout chore’ at all!''.''#4 – Develop a Routine Workout''The thing about keeping fit is that you have to instill a constant and solid''routine''that you can commit to everyday (if not every other day). So for example, if doing regular runs is not your kind of thing, you can choose to do a regular indoor/outdoor workout. Some of the things that I do are as follows and you can pick one of the three below for a day, and then the other the next day etc.:''ABS:''(10 repetitions of each) Regular Crunches,''Bicycle Crunch'',''Crunch Twist'',''Reverse Crunches'',''Vertical Leg Crunch'',''Long Arm Crunch''— and then lastly, do a 1 minute''Plank''LEGS & CORE:''20 Squats, 30''Lunges'', 40''Calf Raises'', 50-second''Wall Squat'', 100 Jumping Jacks, 50-second Wall Squat, 20 Squats, 30''Leg Raises'', 40''Sumo Squats''(wider feet position than a regular squat)''DANCE WORKOUTS:''You can do this right inside the comfort of your hotel or hostel room, and there are tons of free videos on YouTube for this. (Make sure that you vary the workout every day so that you are exercising all muscles in your body. Go for at least 30 minutes worth of exercise.)''BeFit''Fitness Blender''Hip Hop Abs''PopSugar Fitness''Zumba''TIP:''If you’re having a hard time accomplishing the number of repetitions, it’s absolutely fine! Do it gradually until your body slowly eases into the exercise you’re doing. (For example, some of the crunches above can be tough especially if it’s the first time in a long time that you have tried to exercise your muscles for this.) As you go on though, feel free to do more of the repetitions than the standard counts that I’ve mentioned above! Just always remember to never push it, okay? If you ever start to feel a different ache in your body, feel free to stop since it might do you more harm than good if you force yourself.''»''NOTE'':\xa0Yoga is another routine workout you can do. Some people would often bring a yoga mat with them as they travel but that can be quite bulky. If a hotel gym is not within your reach or budget, you can try to use alternatives like your towels or your sleeping bag; but just remember to be careful while using them since the grip that it could give compared to yoga mats would\xa0not be the same (still, it works).''.''#5 – Eat Healthy and Live Well for as Much as You Could''Living\xa0healthy and working out goes hand in hand — one can’t be done effectively without the other!''Always remember this.''For tips to take note of:''Eat as much vegetables and fruits! We all know this but I’d like to put it up here to really stress its importance.''If you can cook your own food in your hostel or accommodation, then by all means, take advantage of it.''NEVER miss breakfast.''A lot of people think that skipping\xa0breakfast saves them calories but that is''NOT''true.\xa0There are a lot of benefits to\xa0eating breakfast but some of the two most striking points that you should remember is that:''It improves your metabolism and provide you energy for the rest of the morning. Remember, you have not eaten anything during the time you were asleep for 8 hours so your body NEEDS to refuel once you wake up.''It will regulate your overeating tendencies for the rest of the day. For instance, if you don’t eat breakfast you will tend to eat too much for lunch because you didn’t pack up on the right nutrients beforehand. So no matter if you’re in a rush, try to grab something\xa0to bite before you go (a banana, yogurt, bread, etc.)''As we travel, it really can’t be helped if we’re suddenly faced with a bad or non-healthy meal and it’s totally fine to consume that for one day. BUT make sure that your next meal is healthier! Try to never eat two bad meals in a row.''Stay hydrated!''It promotes healthy skin, suppresses appetite, boosts metabolism, and so many more. So try to follow the age-old rule of at least 8 glasses a day. It really helps, I’m telling you!''Try to never ‘undereat’ nor overeat.\xa0I can understand if you’re a budget traveler, but it’s important to maintain a balance so as not to upset your metabolism levels. And as for overeating, if you’re someone like me who gets hungry every so often, resist the urge to eat a lot of stuff in one meal alone as it’s better to eat a normal quantity\xa0with frequent small''healthy''food/snacks in between.''Stay away from sodas and minimize your intake of alcoholic beverages. (I know, I know… in traveling it can’t be helped that you’re often faced with parties or whatnot but just try to keep it down.)''.''BONUS NOTE: Choose the activities that works best for you but try to go for\xa0variety too''Certainly, it’s not like I do\xa0everything that I have mentioned above in every single day. I just make do with what I can because what’s really\xa0important is that I\xa0remain and continue to be active!''Though of course,\xa0in order to motivate yourself to keep doing what you do, it helps if you do more of the things that you''actually''enjoy.''For example: I typically dislike\xa0running. So in order to maintain my ‘workout’ routine, I would opt to do more of the indoor exercises because that’s what works best for me. Still and the same, variety is also important so I try to mix those exercises. (Abs for Monday, legs the next day, and then core, etc. etc.)''But then, even if I generally do indoor exercises as a routine, I mix it up too from time to time so that I can exercise all\xa0of the muscles that I have. That’s why in some days, I would inject various activities like running (even if I hate it), swimming, hiking, etc.''(I hope you get my drift).''.''Overall''Given that I have set''Belgium''as my current home base, it can’t be helped that a lot of you guys\xa0are asking me about the best accommodations in Brussels,\xa0the so-called heart of Europe. And well, after hundreds of e-mails,\xa0I think that\xa0it’s high time that I simply\xa0compile it all in one place for everyone’s ease!''So whatever kind of traveler you may be\xa0—\xa0no matter if you’re into luxury or budget travel — when it’s time to think of a place to sleep, here is a list of\xa0the''top best hotels in Brussels''that I highly recommend!''TIP:''When booking for your accommodation, I highly recommend''Booking.com''for two reasons. First, it’s one\xa0of the top trusted booking platforms out there. I have been using them for years and they never fail in giving me the best hotel deal!

But to be honest though, I had thoughts at first that Paris would be so over-romanticized… but\xa0I was wrong, because it was absolutely dreamy and romantic! For sure though, I can’t deny the fact that\xa0there are parts of this city that can be quite dodgy/dirty, there are locals who are too snobby, and there are even scammers scattered everywhere\xa0— but then let me ask you this:''isn’t almost every big city like that?''There will always be ‘bad elements’ abound anyway, and\xa0it’s up to you to perceive the beauty behind all that mess. (Speaking of which, I love this quote: “''There’s beauty in chaos''.”)''Now for my case, I have definitely seen the charm of Paris so it was no wonder to me that it’s one of the top destinations in the world! We stayed here for two days not only to explore the center and that of Montmartre, but to also explore the modern part of Paris:\xa0La Défense.''Montmartre and La Défense are two places that I recommend you to check out since they’re not only interesting, but also less touristy.''TIP'': When going to the\xa0Basilique du Sacré-Cœur, the street that leads to it has rows of ‘vendors’ holding some sort of game on a cardboard box. It’s called a\xa0shell game, three-card monte, three-disk monte or “Bonneteau” and by all costs, avoid that even if a lot of people are crowding over it! I wasn’t able to take a photo of it clearly since the vendor called me out for it (LOL) but basically it’s a''scam''.''The goal is that you have to remember where your card or disk is no matter how much the vendor or dealer scrambles them. To be able to play, you need to pay of course and you can win lots if you guess things right. BUT remember that it’s just \xa0like a magic trick wherein the dealer will make sure that you lose.

Besides,\xa0I have always been fascinated with historical accounts that relate to war; hence the reason why I am also into anything and everything that’s related to the''World Wars!''(This doesn’t mean, of course, that I’m into violence\xa0and warfare. I simply like\xa0this aspect\xa0of the past because of the various emotions, lessons, stories, tactics, and perspectives involved.)''That aside… I cannot deny the charming hold of castles or palaces that were privately-owned by royalty and/or\xa0nobles in the past. Just glancing at\xa0colorful gardens, glittering banquet halls, and spiraling towers instantly make my heart swoon!\xa0 So of course, when it comes to these types of places in Europe, one cannot forget the wondrous''Loire Valley''that’s speckled with various breathtaking châteaux!''.''What is the Loire Valley?''Located in the middle stretch of the Loire River in France, the Loire Valley spans 280 kilometers and it is often called as the ‘''Cradle of the French''‘ or the ‘''Garden of France''‘ mainly because of the great presence of fruit orchards, fields, and vineyards along the river.''Now, much\xa0like what you’ve learned in economics and in history, any area that’s near a body of water is bound to be a great spot for progress and so the Loire Valley\xa0was truly a strategic area in the past. Because of this fact, a lot of nobility have built extravagant castles and fortresses on this part of France which now leads us to today’s famed: ‘''Châteaux of the Loire Valley''‘. (Yep, it’s a part of France that’s speckled with stunning numbers of\xa0châteaux so it’s also aptly called as the ‘''Valley of the Kings''‘!)''TRIVIA:''The châteaux and the whole central region itself\xa0is even listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as it perfectly depicts thousands of years’ worth of rich architecture, art, and agriculture features.''Therefore, other than heading to the Loire Valley for its ‘wine culture’, it’s a great destination for when you’re looking for the splendour of\xa0French châteaux.''We stumbled into this beauty while Jonas and I were doing our first ever ‘EuroTrip’ together back in August 2013 and it was quite an experience!''Castles =\xa0Châteaux?''A''château''is primarily a manor, residence, or country house of nobility that can be with or without fortifications (making it as fortresses).\xa0But of course, the word sure''château''also means ‘castles’ in French that’s why if a distinction is needed, they usually use the term:''château fort''.''There’s also what is called ‘''palais''‘ but in French it’s mainly used when referring to grand manors\xa0in the city so it’s slightly different from the term ‘palace’ in English (which doesn’t make a specific requirement\xa0of having such a residence in an urban place).''.''Château de Chenonceau''There are over hundreds of\xa0châteaux in the Loire Valley that were built between the 10th and 20th centuries. With such a big number, obviously as travelers, we are often after the best ones due to limit of time and money; so\xa0when it comes to that, I can definitely recommend a must-see for your Loire Valley itinerary: the''Château de Chenonceau!''Photo by''Benh LIEU SONG''via Flickr / CC''Arched over the Ricer Cher near the small village of\xa0Chenonceaux, it is one of the best-known châteaux of the Loire Valley and it is termed as the “''Women’s Castle''” since it is the only castle in the region\xa0that has been built, inhabited, and saved by women during the Renaissance.''TRIVIA:''Other than the Royal Palace of Versailles,\xa0the\xa0Château de Chenonceau is the most-visited château in France!''History''To help you understand why this château was primarily run by women, here’s an overview of its historical timeline:''13th Century:''Chenonceau belonged to the Marques family and they built a château and mill on the site in the 1430s after it was torched in 1412.''1513:''Thomas Bohier, Chamberlain to King Charles VIII of France, purchased the castle from Pierre Marques and while he was rebuilding it, his wife Katherine Briçonnet often supervised most of the work.''1535:''The château was seized from Bohier’s son by King Francis I of France due to\xa0unpaid debts to the kingdom.''1547:''After King Francis’ death, King Henry II offered the château as a gift to his mistress, Diane de Poitiers, and she did a lot of work on the estate: attaching an arched bridge to join it to the opposite bank and setting up exquisite gardens in four sections.''1559:''After King Henry II’s death, his widow Catherine de’ Medici forced\xa0Diane to exchange the\xa0Château Chenonceau\xa0for the Château Chaumont with her.\xa0In this time, Catherine added several more\xa0gardens, a gallery, a service wing, and several sets\xa0of rooms.''1589:''When Catherine died in this year, the château was transferred to her daughter-in-law, Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont, wife of King Henry III.''1773:''A wealth squire named Claude Dupin bought the château and his wife, Louise Dupin, saved the property from destruction during the French Revolution by proving how essential it was for travel and commerce as''“being the only bridge across the river for many miles”.''1864:''A rich heiress, Marguerite Pelouze, acquired the château and she commissioned a lot of changes in the structure that it ended up making her broke — and so, the\xa0château ended up being seized and sold.''1891:''A Cuban millionaire, José-Emilio Terry, bought Chenonceau from Pelouze. Terry sold it to a family member, and later on in 1913, it was sold to Henrie Menier who is a member of the Menier family (known for their chocolates) and he\xa0still owns it today!''In Photos''Basically, this is how the estate looks like, and it’s really huge and well-surrounded by gardens''(and even a labyrinth!)''that were built by the women who used to inhabit it over the years:''3rd image above''and''1st photo below''by\xa0Dennis Jarvis''I was\xa0born in a ‘''third world country''‘, the Philippines, and with the ‘power’ that\xa0my passport\xa0holds — which is low — I am no stranger to the fact that I''can’t''just\xa0travel on a whim.''A\xa0passport is said to be very powerful when it can let you go to a lot of countries visa-free under low costs (on\xa0visa fees), high validity (can stay in a foreign country for long), and minimal effort (not a lot of\xa0time needed to acquire a visa).\xa0The top 5 most powerful passports are from Singapore, South Korea, Germany, Japan, and Sweden according to''Passport Index''.''With that data in mind, let’s illustrate how powerless my passport is:\xa0Singaporeans and South Koreans can go visa-free to over 163 countries whereas my Philippines passport can only go to 60 countries. There are other passports who have it worse than I do, but certainly, I can’t just go to American\xa0or European countries at just about any time without going through rigorous + costly visa applications and strict immigration officers first.''So naturally, you can’t blame us, the\xa0third world or second world passport holders, for making it such a big deal whenever we get a visa (because rejections are common tales among all of us) and whenever our travel plans do push through (because a lot of things can go wrong).\xa0Oh, you bet that I celebrated a LOT\xa0when I first got my Schengen Visa!''Now of course\xa0there were millions of times that I wished that visas didn’t exist, but let’s face it: this world needs rules. There''are''some people who have ill intentions for going abroad and a country has to protect its citizens and society. For instance, the Philippines is typically referred to as a\xa0‘high risk’ country for most embassies because we have a huge number of people in the past (and even in the present) who either want\xa0to overstay\xa0abroad or work\xa0illegally.''If we put\xa0all of these factors together, it’s quite common then that the question of: “''How to travel the world on a second or third world passport?''” would be commonly met with negativity and answers of “''It’s impossible!''”\xa0(In fact, a lot of people message me with this kind of mindset.)''HOWEVER…''let me tell you that it''IS''possible because I, for one, have been''making my way around the world''ever since 2013 with my Philippine passport — and there are a LOT of underprivileged\xa0passport holders out there who are doing the same as well!''So don’t let yourself think that visas will prevent you from making your traveling dreams a reality, because there are''soooo''many ways to make it happen. (Yes, no matter\xa0if you hold the most complicated and powerless passport there is.) It\xa0will\xa0just be tiring, long, and meticulous; but as long as you prepare for it and accomplish all the requirements or paperwork ahead of time, your dreams of traveling the world won’t certainly be a''dream''anymore in the long run!''In a way, applying for visas under\xa0a limited\xa0passport embodies this quote very well:''If you want something you’ve never had, you must be willing to do something you’ve never done.''Click To Tweet''…and that is to sacrifice some of your effort, money, and time. (Sometimes, even a LOT of it!) Well actually, this applies to any goal since we have to give up some things some times in order to get what we truly desire.\xa0Although hopefully, with this post, I will help alleviate your worries and assist you to ‘success’\xa0as I list out below the ways on\xa0how to travel the world on\xa0a third world passport!''NOTE: This post will be updated as needed whenever I learn of new methods and tips.''.''How to Travel the World on a 3rd World Passport''When it’s about\xa0destinations…''» Prioritize visa-free entry or VOA (visa-on arrival) countries!''This is a''no-brainer''but a lot of us tend to forget this notion.''Look at it this way:\xa0traveling to 60 visa-free countries under a\xa0Philippine passport, as an example, would already make you go on a ‘world trip’ for''years!''Hence, don’t force yourself to go to Europe or USA especially if it would take you a while\xa0to prepare\xa0all your\xa0documents. Besides, building up yourself as a well-traveled person (especially if its your first time to travel abroad) can really help for future visa applications;\xa0so traveling to such ‘easier countries’ first can\xa0help you accomplish that. Let’s not even forget that most of the time, a lot of the\xa0visa-free countries have a lower cost of living; therefore, that will help take off the pressure on your travel fund too!''NOTE'': Be informed\xa0of the difference between ‘visa-free entry’ and ‘visa on arrival’. Visa free entry means as is: you can enter and stay in a country for a period of time. Whereas visa on arrival means that you still need a visa to enter but you can avail that sticker\xa0either by paying for it once you arrive or by applying for it beforehand online or via the embassy in order\xa0to get a confirmation of\xa0your stay.''VisaMap''is a good resource for determining what countries you can enter into freely or not''—''this is as dependent on your passport of course; though,\xa0considering that\xa0the data there is also controlled by users, it’s safe for you to research and verify things either by doing a quick search on Google or by inquiring with the appropriate embassy.''If you ever need some guidance in pinpointing the best countries to venture into (as ranked by cost of living, safety, etc.) as well as  planning your overall travel lifestyle, you can click on my articles below:''» READ:''Best Countries for Travelers & Digital Nomads''How to Start a Life of Travel''The Ultimate Guide on How to Become a Digital Nomad''.''If you travel a lot like I do, we both\xa0know that\xa0there\xa0are unavoidable accidents and conditions which\xa0could\xa0destroy\xa0our gadgets.

Given this fact, I am often wary in bringing it along with me\xa0as go on adventures out\xa0on the road… but of course, the fact remains that I still\xa0need a phone on me.''Now surely\xa0there are numerous protective cases available in the market today\xa0and I assure you that I have\xa0already tried most\xa0of the popular\xa0brands out there. However, I have come to realize lately that there’s one brand that stood out from the rest:''LifeProof cases''.''I say this because a few months back, LifeProof sent me some samples to try. As a user, I certainly\xa0wanted to test their\xa0cases\xa0thoroughly before making a final verdict. And well today, I can absolutely\xa0say with confidence that the LifeProof cases are truly\xa0built for an active lifestyle and built with extreme protection in mind! Truth be told, they completely\xa0took away my worries for my tech gear as I did\xa0various activities: swimming, hiking, motorbiking, and more.''.''Why I Love LifeProof Cases''Four Proofs = Zero Worries''These LifeProof cases are primarily for Apple\xa0products, but they also offer items for Samsung and Motorola phones. Also, their two major types of cases are the''Fre''and''NÜÜD''series. The main difference between the two is the\xa0screen: Fre has a built-in screen protector whereas\xa0NÜÜD is screenless so that you can touch your device’s actual screen (giving you perfect clarity and touch control).''Personally, I prefer to use the\xa0NÜÜD series.\xa0I didn’t want the added protector screen of Fre since\xa0I already have a screen protector applied to my iPhone. Add the fact on how it felt more solid to me, and has less of a plastic-feel compared to that of the Fre. Yet despite the minor differences between the two main case types, they both have the same core property, “''4 Proofs''“:''WaterProof:''With LifeProof cases, not only can you use your phone near water, but you can also submerge it up to 6.6 feet or 2 meters for up to 1 hour! It’s helpful to note that all the LifeProof\xa0items are factory water-tested for several times before shipment so you are sure to receive a leak-free phone case.''DirtProof:''Because of its perfect seal, your gadget is fully protected from dirt and dust too.''SnowProof:''Even more, it’s well closed to the elements of snow and ice.''DropProof:''Finally, LifeProof cases have a U.S. Military Standard for drop and shock protection, meaning that it can physically withstand the drops, fumbles, vibrations and bumps that you may ever encounter. In fact, your phone can survive a fall from 6.6 feet or 2 meters!''Great Fit''The first time that I used my\xa0NÜÜD case, I instantly put it to the test. Besides, every package comes with instructions for it and after the initial process of proving that\xa0the LifeProof case is completely waterproof, what’s next is to test it for real with my iPhone 5s.''To cut the story short, it worked — my LifeProof was really water-proof despite how the\xa0NÜÜD case was screenless! (Apparently, it has a tight rubber ring around the screen to prevent water from coming in).''Though for sure, I have to say that\xa0it was a nerve-wracking experience to watch\xa0my iPhone\xa0sinking to the bottom of my sink… but as it was, my iPhone really remained functional and I was even able to use commands while it was underwater! Surely after that test, I did not hold\xa0back in using my iPhone with a LifeProof case as I went on\xa0several swimming trips last\xa0summer.''Needless to say, LifeProof cases are really engineered to fit perfectly with your device and it also works\xa0well\xa0with every feature and function of your\xa0gadget.''CONS'': The only problem that I see with the fit is that given the firm material that it is made of, I sometimes need to push hard on some buttons. But it didn’t reach the point where it became annoying since after some use, I started to get a feel of the right pressure to apply for pressing.''Light, Sleek, & Slim Design''One of the most common features of protective cases is the bulk, which often makes the overall look of the smartphone as unappealing and which also makes the smartphone heavier to hold. Thankfully, LifeProof was made in such a light, sleek, and slim design\xa0— but still with the full premium protection!''Availability of the ‘LifeJacket’ Accessory''If in case you’re planning on doing more extreme activities in the water, the LifeProof cases can’t float by themselves if in case you drop them while you’re swimming, surfing, or whatnot… But don’t worry, because with their''LifeJacket''series\xa0—''just like what the name implies''— you can give your gadgets their own ‘life raft’! Therefore, the LifeProof LifeJacket keep your phone or tablet afloat on the surface, and with its eye-catching color, it makes it easy to spot if for instance you lose it during a river rafting activity.''That being said, LifeProof is terrific for offering you peace of mind.''.''Overall''What makes up a great travel blog?''To name a few, that would entail\xa0quality content, regular updates,\xa0great readership engagement, \xa0good use of SEO practices,\xa0and wide\xa0online reach.

Said to be\xa0the center of the Santo Niño celebration in the Philippines, one of the\xa0main highlights of this festivity\xa0would be\xa0the Sinulog Grand Parade that runs for 9 to 12 hours! This parade is held on the final day,\xa0and it is''soooo''popular that millions of people''(that are not only composed of Filipinos but also foreigners from around the world)''would flock to this occasion every year.''TRIVIA:''In fact, it once\xa0reached\xa04 million visitors. In a way, this celebration can easily rival the colorful Carnival in Rio de Janeiro\xa0–\xa0Brazil or even Mardi Gras!''Photo by''Ronald Tagra''/ CC''Now,\xa0what happens during this Sinulog Festival’s grand parade?''Street dancing of course!''It’s basically\xa0a long procession that consists of several grouped street dancers who\xa0are all clad in colorful costumes and backdropped with amazingly-decorated platforms. As they go through the whole of the town, they would\xa0perform either their own dance steps or the\xa0‘''Sinulog dance''‘ — a distinct forward-backward movement which\xa0is in tune\xa0to a very recognizable drumbeat\xa0that identifies this festivity. To add, this dance step perfectly depicts the meaning of the word ‘Sinulog’ which is from the Cebuano adverb ‘sulog’ which\xa0means: “''like a water current movement''“.''TRIVIA:''Usually, the dancers’ performances are interpretations of how Santo Niño had helped their respective communities.''And as they dance, they would occasionally shout petitions or words of thanks\xa0like''“Pit Senyor kang Mama kini, Pit Senyor kang Papa kini!”''or simply the more identifiable phrase''“Viva Pit Señor!”''which means “to call, ask, and plead to the king”. There would also be a girl that’s usually in front of each group who\xa0would wave icons of the Santo Niño in their\xa0hands as they move along the crowd.''This is actually some sort of reenactment of Queen Amihan (the wife of the''Rajah''or former king of Cebu)\xa0who had received the image of the Sto. Nino in the past — an occurrence\xa0that is signifcant a part of how Sinulog Festival commemmorates the Filipino’s acceptance of Christianity.''.''My First Sinulog Festival Experience''To sum it all up in one word, my first Sinulog Festival\xa0was…''intense''. And I bet every first-timer out there has the same sentiment! Truth be told, it actually still surprises me how I was able to survive walking through the throng of people as I tried to get from one place to another.''It was really crazy.''Photo by''Ronald Tagra''/ CC''I went to this event with my friends back in 2013\xa0and initially, there were 10 of us who were all moving altogether during the procession; but as the day droned on, the sea of people forced us to separate and I ended up with just 4 of my friends with me!''(Thank goodness for technology though, we managed to get together again later by the day.)''Now our Sinulog adventure turned out to be some sort of obstacle activity since our accommodation\xa0was situated outside the city center —\xa0and the city center is exactly where the festival’s core events were being held. Most streets were already blocked at that point thought, therefore\xa0we can’t just get a taxi or a jeepney in order to reach the procession. That’s why in the end, we had to walk.''Mind you, walking wasn’t such an easy task since we had to go\xa0through 5 various locations that were''ridiculously''packed''with people,\xa0and it was only a couple of hours later that we finally reached\xa0a less-crowded area that enabled us to watch the grand parade.\xa0Naturally at that time, I was already exhausted!''But then again… as I stood there watching the street dancers, I started to feel that the ‘trouble’\xa0that I had\xa0gone\xa0through\xa0was''oh-so-worth-it''because it was an absolute spectacle to watch the parade up close! For one thing, it was''soooo''colorful, and along\xa0with the smiles and cheerful faces of the performers, I just can’t help but feel as if all my exhaustion\xa0had melted away.''Besides, they really put a LOT of effort into everything.\xa0Just think\xa0about all the work\xa0that they had to do in order to come up with their costumes and equipment!''All photos above by''Ronald Tagra''/ CC''After a while,\xa0Jonas who was also with me at that time, remembered that he had\xa0a friend who had a condo that was located near where we were. He arrived at this thought because the place that we were in was slowly streaming in with more people. We definitely didn’t want to battle with yet another herd of people so \xa0we decided to take refuge\xa0in that condo for a\xa0while.''Once we arrived at the venue which was\xa030 floors high, I looked out to the Sinulog Festival scene below me and I was''flabbergasted''. Just look at this!''There’s no doubt that this celebration is visited by millions! And again, it’s seriously amazing how everyone manages to brave through such an ordeal (while we are at that line of thought, I’d like to take this moment to give myself a pat on the back).''Surely,\xa0I’ve had my fair share of packed trains back in Manila, but this event was just on a whole other level!''After some time, we tried going back to the crowd several times, but we ended up being defeated not only by the horde, but by the heat too! So, we went back again to the condo building\xa0but\xa0this time, we settled into a cafe. I’ll keep this short but yeah… one thing led to another and I ended up singing on stage while their performers took a break. Haha!''Come night time, the grand parade typically\xa0ends and the street dancers will do their final performance at the\xa0Cebu City Sports Complex. (This is where they will hold the competition leg of the Sinulog festival with 3\xa0categories, namely the Street Dancing Category, Free Interpretation and Sinulog base categories.)''It was quite impossible for us to join this event since the sports complex was too\xa0packed, that’s why we decided to simply\xa0roam the streets and attend the late night parties!''Yep, Sinulog Festival doesn’t end with the parade because after that\xa0is done with, everyone goes to Mango Square, Baseline or\xa0Fuente Osmeña to have some fun\xa0until the wee hours of the next day. Truth be told, most would say that this is the best part of Sinulog!''(See below a video on how a typical\xa0Sinulog Festival night party goes).''Photo by''Raleene Cabrera''/ CC''As you can see, it can get pretty rowdy here since everyone is on ‘wild mode’\xa0— but in a fun and good way! First things first, expect people to put paint on you. Like… a LOT of it! And sometimes, you could expect random people to just go up to you, hug you, and be chummy with you.''I actually experienced the ‘hugging’ part, and it was funny and scary (just a tiny bit) all at the same time.''I was walking with Jonas and my friends along one of the party places when suddenly, I saw around 7 people in front who were looking straight at me… and I just knew at that instant that I was their target, and as if on cue, they started to scream,''“Free hugs! Group hug!”''Since I was also obviously in Sinulog wild mode, for sure I was like, heck yeah, why not?\xa0And so I let them hug me. LOL.''But what was supposed to be nice calm hugs (well at least that’s what I thought) turned out to be tight rough hugs.''Think: hugging someone to death.''I started to think, “''Uh-oh, I think I’m gonna fall… Wait, or am I going to be\xa0trampled?''”''Fortunately, Jonas was there so as soon as he saw what was happening, he tried to pry away the number of people who were all over me. Now let’s take into consideration how Jonas is a giant, so safe to say, the hugging parade let me go once they glanced at the ‘tower’ before them. :P''Of course they meant well, and honestly, though they were freakishly hyper,\xa0it was actually a fun moment nonetheless! I guess they were intoxicated either with beer or with the festival’s\xa0atmosphere…\xa0and I can’t blame\xa0them for that because again, Sinulog is really''intense!''.''Tips for\xa0Sinulog Festival''Book your accommodation''waaaay''ahead of time.''Preferrably, as early as August. Why? You have to remember that there are millions of people who want to attend this every year so it’s not a surprise for most hotels to be fully-booked months prior!''Best location:''Pick a hotel that’s near the parade.\xa0These\xa0would be the areas near Capitol, Ayala Shopping Mall, SM Shopping Mall, downtown, or\xa0Fuente Osmeña.\xa0Take note\xa0that since most of the streets will be blocked off, taxis will be hard to come by, and then usually after the festival, it’s even harder to get a hold of them so it’s best that you pick a place that you can just walk to afterwards.''(To illustrate, since our accommodation was far,\xa0we had a hard time finding a taxi or even a non-packed jeepney after the parade. Thankfully we found a motorist who was willing to give us a ride in exchange for a small fee. So if you don’t want this kind of hassle, again, plan for this ahead of time!)''.''While we’re speaking of planning, don’t book a flight on the day of Sinulog Festival.''That’s a very bad idea because like I said, most of the main roads will be barricaded for the parade.''.''On the day itself, wear disposable shorts and shirt.''If you’re planning on staying for the crazy after-parties, like I mentioned previously, paint will be involved so you’re better off wearing something that you wouldn’t mind throwing away later on. Speaking of which, sometimes they use color powder and sometimes they would even\xa0splash beer and water on everyone. Yep, it’s that rowdy… but fun.''-wink-''(Note: make sure to protect your gadgets!)''.''Wear comfortable clothes and bring the essentials.''While we’re in the topic of clothing, you’ll be doing a lot of walking under the intense heat of the sun. Therefore, you should make sure that you’re wearing the right clothes AND the right shoes. It’s certainly best if you wear shoes or sneakers since sometimes there are debris or broken glasses on the road. (If in case it’s going to rain, then of course bring an umbrella). While you’re at it, make sure that you wear sunscreen and that you pack some water.''.''Stay vigilant.''This is common sense, but I have to stress the importance of this thought because with all the things that are happening, you can easily get\xa0distracted during Sinulog so be wary of pickpockets. At best, try to avoid wearing a backpack and go for bags that you can position in front.''.''Get acquainted with Cebu.''Right before you plunge into the Sinulog Festival, make sure that you go over a map first (most especially if it’s your first time to come to this place). With all the swarm of people\xa0and the countless barricaded streets, you would often have to take different routes. So other than reviewing the layout of the city beforehand, bring a map with you! Or better yet, if you have a friend who lives in Cebu, ask them out!''.''Overall''Have you heard of''Snapchat?''If you haven’t, it’s basically a\xa0phone app that lets you share and send photos +\xa0videos to\xa0your friends and followers. It might seem like it’s another one of those so-so social medial platforms, but let me tell you that it’s''NOT''. It’s really''fun''to use and I personally love it! Truth be told, its''exclusivity''will make you want for more ‘snaps’ every day! Why so?''It’s''REAL.''Snapchat is like YouTube and Instagram mashed together but less the''perfection'', which is nice for a change because everything\xa0is ‘as is’.''All photos and videos (''called as ‘snaps’'')\xa0can only be primarily\xa0taken with one’s camera phone\xa0on-the-spot. So, there’s no room for pre-editing…''BUT there are awesome post-editing filters and features that you can do on your snaps.\xa0What this means then is that though everything is taken''raw'', with the added photo + video styles\xa0that Snapchat has to offer, you will absolutely see everyone’s\xa0quirky\xa0personality!''Everything gets delivered''LIVE'', so you can see what everyone is\xa0doing in real time. You can actually\xa0think of Snapchat\xa0as some\xa0sort of medium for people to put up their own\xa0reality show as\xa0they display to you\xa0their day to day life!''It’s''SHORT BUT SWEET''. Every photo and video that’s collected in a day (''which is called a ‘story''‘''in the app'')\xa0can be set with a time limit between 1 to 10 seconds; so it’s safe to say that you won’t be bored to death since\xa0everything is pretty straightforward.''Snapchat is''PRIVATE''and''PERSONAL''. Unlike other social media channels wherein you can discover other users through tags or whatnot, Snapchat focuses a lot on privacy given how all ‘snaps’ are erased after 24 hours. Besides, if you want to know who to follow on Snapchat, you can only find and add them if they let you\xa0know\xa0their username.''Putting all of these factors together, you can get the idea now that Snapchat is''unique'', and as a user, I like the anticipation that comes with it as I look forward\xa0to the next snaps of the people I’m following!''Speaking of which, you’re probably wondering who to follow on Snapchat now… Well, when it comes to igniting your wanderlust, I have the''perfect''list of travel bloggers\xa0who are\xa0more than willing to\xa0take you along in\xa0their adventures around the world!''.''Who to Follow on Snapchat: 10 Travelers''#1''– Louis of @FunForLouis''Who hasn’t heard of Louis Cole?

It’s surely a nerve-wracking ordeal to be responsible for someone else’s life and safety… so how much more when you have your own child, right?\xa0That’s why\xa0as early as now, you must understand the ‘natural instinct’ of our parents to protect and worry about us.''Now, I come from a family that’s very traditional so\xa0they are fiercely set on the\xa0normal flow of life:''study, graduate, work in a good company, marry, have kids, and then retire''.

Where did you stay and how was it?''Would you like to try the Historic Hotels Ghent\xa0(again)?''Did you like this article?''Follow me on''Facebook'',''Twitter'',''Instagram'', or''YouTube''and be notified about my newest posts and updates!''Ghent and''Bruges'', the charming ‘''darlings''‘ of Belgium, have long been pitted against one another — not only by tourists but even by locals themselves! I still fondly remember how a mini debate ensued when I first asked Jonas’ Belgian friends thoughts on the\xa0most beautiful town/city in Belgium. As soon as the question rolled out off my lips, there was instantly a divide:\xa0the Ghent team and the Bruges team.''(Of course there were biased people in the bunch since they lived in or close to either of the two.)''At the end of the day though, there wasn’t a ‘winner’ in the argument\xa0so I simply decided that I will check these two\xa0places for myself! Having lived here in Belgium for almost more than a\xa0year now, I’ve surely visited both for several times already. So, the final verdict?''Well,\xa0trust me when I say this:''BOTH''were''soooo''lovely may it be day time or night time and it’s all because of their equally spell-binding structures and canals — naturally, I can’t just pick one! Of course they’re not entirely the same, but both Ghent and Bruges have their individual strengths and weaknesses that in the end, they just balanced out.''For instance, Bruges wins in\xa0the ‘''cuteness''‘ department for being such a small yet enchanting historical and medieval\xa0city (some would even say that it’s like a ‘city museum’ in itself); however, due to its long-standing popularity as one of Europe’s stunning little cities, it typically results to a very touristy atmosphere. On the other hand, Ghent has a bigger area, resulting to a\xa0more\xa0dynamic\xa0city with lesser tourists (it’s even contested as an underrated picturesque destination in the country); however, some would say\xa0that it loses a bit on the''romantic''side of things as compared to Bruges, especially with the\xa0more urban atmosphere that surrounds Ghent.''Given these points, I bet you can imagine by now that if you combine the two, they would surely\xa0become an unbeatable pair!''So I say'': arrange a trip for the\xa0both of them if you have the time. But\xa0if you don’t, then with your knowledge now of the pros and cons of each, as per your traveling style, you can determine the best destination for yourself.''To read and know more about Bruges as well as the things that you can do, come and check out my post here:''» READ:''Picturesque Break in Bruges: The Medieval Fairy Tale Town in Belgium''Meanwhile, to know more about the''city of Ghent'', do continue reading through this article\xa0especially since what I am sharing with you today is my own self-guided walking route/tour! This would absolutely make your traveling ordeal a lot more hassle-free. I really hope it helps!''.''Exploring Ghent: A Self-Guided\xa0Walking Route''QUICK\xa0FACTS ABOUT GHENT:''It\xa0is''Gent''in Dutch and''Gand''in French. (It helps to know since''Belgium''predominantly speaks [Flemish] Dutch and French).''It\xa0is the capital and largest city of the East Flanders province\xa0with\xa0a population\xa0that is around\xa0248,000+ as of January 2013.''One of the well-known festivities would be Ghent Festival / Festivities or ‘Gentse Feesten’ which is held every year for 10 days\xa0by\xa0mid-July\xa0and attended by millions of visitors!''Ghent residents are called as rope or ‘noose\xa0bearers’ (''Stroppendragers'') since in the past, after revolting in 1539 against the regime of Charles V (who was the\xa0Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain in 1539) and failing in doing so, Charles made the nobles of Ghent to parade around town barefoot and with a noose rope around their neck. (You’ll see a statue somewhere in Prinsenhof commemorating this time in the past, and you will also notice that some signs feature this ‘element’).''Now, even though it’s \xa0big city, you can actually explore the town by foot in just a day! For your ease, I have included a map below showing the address and routes of the top hotspots in Ghent, followed by a listed section that briefly explains each of these places.''#1''– Patershol''Photo by''VisitGent''/ CC''An old and medieval quarter in Ghent, Patershol is your go-to place if you truly want to find the ‘gastronomic’ or ‘foodie’ center of the city. Lined with an array of small cafes and restaurants, there is definitely something for everyone here. Besides, this area holds a charm given its closed street pattern — truth be told, this is said to be one of the most desirable neighborhoods in the city!''TRIVIA:''This side of the river is called as the ‘''Domain of the Counts''’ as it\xa0was originally the property of the count (meaning that it was not owned by the city).''#2''–\xa0Kraanlei''(L) Photo by''Donar Reiskoffer''/ CC and (R) Photo by''VisitGent''/ CC''Follow the route indicated in the map above and you will arrive at the street of Kraanlei which is by the river. Right somewhere in the middle of this stretch, you will see two interesting houses. First will be\xa0Kraanlei 81 which is a\xa0baroque house richly-decorated with a flute player, the five senses, a flying deer, and many others. Next will be Kraanlei 79 which is just beside it. It’s called as the\xa0Six Works of Mercy adorned with 6 figures. However,\xa0historians are arguing that there was a seventh which depicts the burial of the dead and they claim that it could have been omitted as it was too grim.''NOTE:''Today, this house is a shop that sells Ghent specialties. A must-try would be the cuberdons, that are sweet raspberry-flavored gum. It’s fondly called as ‘''Gentse neus''‘''or\xa0Ghent nose because, as it is, it looks like a human’s nose.''»''Another surrounding\xa0sight\xa0to see'': Ghent’s version of Manneken Pis which they claim to be older than the''Manneken Pis in Brussels''.''#3''–\xa0Gravensteen''Smacked right in the middle of the city\xa0stands the imposing''Gravensteen''or ‘Castle of the Counts’ that is referred to as one of the strongest moated fortresses in Western Europe.\xa0Originating from the Middle Ages, this was built by the past count Philip of Alsace and has since then became the seat of the Counts of Flanders. But somewhere along the way, it was abandoned which lead the castle to become a courthouse and a prison at certain points in time.''Today though, it is a museum that does not only showcase medieval armors but medieval torturing devices as well. I took the chance to do the tour here and it was interesting and… refreshing. (I say this because the first time that I visited this castle, I had just finished visiting the castles in France which were predominantly filled with stuff from royalty. Therefore it was quite a new experience when I finally landed into a castle that actually shows historical weapons, warfare, and the like).''»''Fees'':\xa0Basic price €10.00 / For\xa0+65 years €7.50 For those below\xa026 years €6.00 / For\xa019 years and below €0.00''#4''– De Oude Vismijn''Or ‘Old Fishmarket’ is located in the square of\xa0Sint-Veerleplein and it is one of the oldest markets in the city. In here, you will see the gatehouse built in Rococo-style. It was originally decorated with three statues of sea gods but after a fire in 1872, only the statue of Neptune (in the middle) was saved. The rest were replaced by statues of a man and a woman that respectively represents the River Scheldt and River Leie.''NOTE:''It’s in this area where you will find Ghent’s Tourist Office.''#5''– Jan Breydelstraat''If you are into unique finds, make sure that you pass by this narrow yet picturesque street of Jan Breydelstraat. In here you will find several interesting shops and restaurants such as that of:''The Fallen Angels'':\xa0for those who want a touch of nostalgia,\xa0you will find here a lot of old and vintage stuff!''Bloemenijs'': come\xa0try out a unique flower ice cream.''House of Elliot'': one of the top restaurants in Ghent and a Michelin-accredited restaurant, it’s a must to try their lobsters! Just make sure you reserve in advance.''You will also find key spots like:''Het Design Museum'': this is a good place to visit if you’re into\xa0contemporary and interior design.''Appelbrugparkje'':\xa0one of the many hidden gems in Ghent, this is a park that has a really nice view of the river.''#6''– Graslei & Korenlei''The most-pictured area\xa0in Ghent is this area around and between the streets of''Graslei''and''Korenlei''. (If you’re following my map above, you’ll be standing at the''Korenlei''side with the''Graslei''street on the other side of the water).''A\xa0lot of the locals would proudly claim that this is the most beautiful spot in their city and I have to agree with them! It was truly and absolutely magical both during the day and the night. Back in the 11th century, these both formed\xa0the city’s first trading harbor. In this time though, amidst several medieval guild houses that have survived the years (such as the Grain Weighers, the Guildhall of the Free Boatmen, and more), it is mainly a ‘hangout place’ speckled by cafes and restaurants\xa0here and there so that visitors and locals alike can enjoy the amazing view while eating. (You will also find a lot of\xa0people who would just resort to sitting by the river, so feel free to do the same!)''#7''– Sint-Michielsbrug''(St. Michael’s Bridge) Walk down a bit further and go up the bridge! This is the best place to enjoy a\xa0panoramic 360\xa0view of almost all the top attractions in Ghent.\xa0You will see the Graslei and Korenlei in front of you, the St. Michael’s Church behind you, the Castle of the Counts in the distance, and the main ‘three towers’ ahead:\xa0Saint Nicholas Church, Belfry Tower, and Saint Bavo’s Cathedral. You should NOT miss taking a view and a shot from this vantage point!''#8''– Sint-Michielskerk''As I’ve mentioned above, just beside the St. Michael’s Bridge would be Saint Michael’s Church (that’s why the bridge was called as such). Clearly, as you have seen from the featured photo of this post as well as from the photo above, this Roman Catholic church is a wondrous sight! Supposedly, this was\xa0planned to be 134 meters high,\xa0but due to delays and cost concerns, the tower was never completed and it just stands now at 24 meters\xa0— which is absolutely fine. I personally think that it looks really good this way!''NOTE:''You will find here the famous painting\xa0‘Christ on the Cross’ by Anthony Van Dyck.''#9''– Het Pand''Photo by''Demeester''/ CC''Walk a little bit further and you will see Het Pand, a former Dominican monastery and hospital which is now a cultural and congress center owned by Ghent University. As a recognized monument, this is worth checking out! Besides, the courtyard is quite a pretty sight.''#10''– Sint-Niklaaskerk''Photo by''VisitGent''/ CC''By now, you are at the commercial heart of Ghent, but smacked right in the middle would be the old St. Nicholas’ church which is an exemplary example of the Scheldt Gothic architectural style.\xa0One of the highlights of this church would be its organ which is produced by the famous French organ builder Aristide Cavaillé-Coll.''#11''– Metselaarshuis''Photo by''Tania Dey''/ CC''Called as Masons’ Guild Hall in English, this structure that’s just opposite of St. Nicholas’ church is the original 16th century Masons’ Guild Hall (“''original''” since there’s an exact copy of it on the''Graslei''). And like any other typical guild hall, you will see on the top of their\xa0stepped gable some\xa0distinguishing statues — this one has 6 dancers that look like they’re merrily frolicking around. (This was placed by\xa0Ghent sculptor and folk-singer Walter De Buck, the one who spearheads the Ghent Festival).''#12''– Stadshal''Photo by''VisitGent''/ CC''After a string of old historical landmarks, this will be the first modern structure that you will see in the city!\xa0A large open canopy structure that demands attention in the middle of the Emile Braun square,''Stadshal''or ‘Town Hall’\xa0was erected as part of the urban reconstruction goals for this public area. Underneath, there is an area that includes a brasserie, dressing rooms, public toilets, and a bicycle park.''Nearby you will see other landmarks like:''Emile Braunplein'': a small park that also has\xa0the…''De Bron der Geknielden:''(The Fountain of the Kneelers) a\xa0masterpiece\xa0composed of 6 naked young men who are seemingly staring into the reflection of the fountain’s water.\xa0Made by a Belgian artist, George Minne, this artpiece is said to signify Narcissus from the Greek mythology who did the same thing out of narcissism.''Mammelokker'':\xa0this was quite a sight! It depicts the legend of Cimon who was condemned to starve to death, but he was saved by his daughter who breastfed him every day. (The name means exactly as is! “''Mamme''” = breast. “''Lokken''” = suck.)''#13''– Het Belfort van Gent''Right poto by''Johan Bakker''/ CC''The ‘Belfry of Ghent’ is about 91 meters high, making it the tallest belfry in the whole of Belgium.\xa0In the past, it used to be a bell tower, a watch tower, and the place where records of municipal privileges were kept. With its adjoining rectangular hall, it also used to be the\xa0cloth hall which\xa0handled the cloth trade in the city during the Middle Ages (at the entrance of the small annex connected to this hall, you will see Mammelokker which I’ve just discussed above).''NOTE:''This is listed under the UNESCO World Heritage List.''#14''– Koninklijke Nederlandse Schouwburg\xa0(NTGent)''Photo by''VisitGent''/ CC''The Royal Dutch Theatre\xa0is the city’s municipal auditorium\xa0where\xa0you can enjoy both of the classical and contemporary plays. Not only is it a spectacle from the inside, but from the outside as well as the god, Apollo, stands in the middle of the square upon a\xa0fountain! To learn more about\xa0the theatre’s\xa0schedule, see''here''.''#15''– Sint-Baafskathedraal Gent''Photo by''VisitGent''/ CC''(St. Bavo’s Cathedral) This is the ‘seat’ of the diocese or bishop of Ghent.\xa0In 942, this used to be a small wooden church but later on expanded in Romanesque style by 1038 and onwards.\xa0Come 1559 when the Diocese of Ghent was founded, this church became its cathedral. Today, St. Bavo’s Cathedral holds a lot of treasures! From famous paintings (''Saint Bavo enters the Convent at Ghent''and''The Calvary Triptych''by Justus van Gent,''View of Gent''by Lucas de Heere, etc.) to key treasures (rococo pulpit, Baroque high altar, tombs of bishops, etc.), there are surely a lot of things to see here.''But of course, the one work that stands out from all of the rest is the world-famous 12-paneled''Ghent Altarpiece\xa0(Adoration of the Mystic Lamb)''.''As one of\xa0Belgium and the world’s greatest masterpieces (for being the\xa0first major oil painting depicting the A to Z of Christianity), it\xa0is said to be the''most stolen''artwork of all time!\xa0Why so? Well, it was robbed\xa0by Napoleon, nearly burned by Calvinists, hunted in WWI, and repeatedly stolen in WWII (Hitler and Nazis really wanted to own it). In fact, up till now, a part of it is still missing which is\xa0‘The Just Judges’ panel.''TRIVIA:''If you watched the movie,''The Monuments Men'',''this is one of the paintings that they were trying to recover.''When I first visited Ghent in 2013, I saw this painting up close in''Museum voor Schone Kunsten*''(Gent Museum of Fine Arts) as they were doing a routine fix for it. It’s still there since they are doing a 7-year restoration, so you can definitely visit this museum to get a look of it up close and LIVE as they do their work. So what then is in St. Bavo’s Cathedral?''Two thirds''of the original work and the missing panels that are being restored are replaced by black and white replicas.''*''The location of the museum is a bit far outside the city center so\xa0I didn’t include it in the map above.''#16''– Geeraard de Duivelsteen''Photo by''Lech Linkel''/ CC''This is the ‘Castle of Gerald the Devil’\xa0named after the\xa0Knight, Geeraard Vilain. He was no devil but he was nicknamed that way and this edifice\xa0played a vital role in defending the''Portus Ganda'', a trading post which was the foundation of the creation of Ghent in the past. Over time, it has\xa0been a knight’s residence, an arsenal, a monastery, a school, a bishop’s seminary, a madhouse and a prison.''#17''–\xa0Stadhuis''This is the official Town or City Hall of Ghent (not to be confused with #12) and you would immediately be struck by awe with its two ‘faces’:\xa0the\xa0flamboyant Gothic style on the right (by Hoogpoort street) and the dark Renaissance style on the left (by Botermarkt street).''You can also see a lot of architectural styles in this building: the Arsenal Hall’s wooden vaulting, the Pacification Hall with its labyrinth, the Wedding Chapel with its stained glass windows and so much more!''NOTE:''Nearby, you will see\xa0Sint Jorishof which is the oldest hotel in Western Europe where Maria of Burgundy stayed in 1477.''#18''– Werregarenstraat or\xa0Graffitistraatje''Launched as a graffiti project during the 1995 Ghent Festival, this has since remained as a ‘tolerant zone’ for all types of graffiti and where all street art are to be placed. Artists are even given the freedom to change the artworks as they please; therefore, you could expect that the view here will change from time to time. This was a fun place to visit so keep your camera on hand!''#19''– Sint-Jacobskerk''Photo by''Paul Hermans''/ CC''(St. James’ Church)\xa0Dating back to the Romanesque period, this church has gone through a lot of renovation, destruction, and expansion. Meanwhile, the surrounding square called as Bij Sint-Jacobs and the Trefpunt café is the epicenter of the Ghent Festivities every year.''#20''– Vrijdagmarkt''(Friday Market)\xa0This is another one of the oldest squares in the city and it played a big role in history as it used to be where all political and social life in Ghent took place — though it’s also where public executions were done. Surrounding this area are restaurants as well as key landmarks that you could check out:''Toreken'': a 15th century tower where trade regulations were used to be announced from''Ons Huis'': (Our House) a monumental home of socialist trade unions''Jacob van Artevelde statue'':\xa0a key figure and the ‘Wise Man of Ghent’ whose support of the English King kept the city (as well as Flanders) to remain neutral and unharmed during the Hundred Years War. He was murdered years later by rivals and Ghent is still called today sometimes as the ‘City of Artvelde’''Tavern Dulle Griet'': this is not a historical spot per se, but I highlighted this since it’s a\xa0legendary café\xa0to go to for Belgian beers! They have over 260 types, and customers can swap one of their shoes for a Max beer (served in a boot-shaped glass). But don’t worry, you can get your shoe back afterwards.''#21''– Dulle Griet''Bottom photo by''Wernervc''/ CC''By the River Leie, you will chance upon this quaint-looking spot where you can not only unwind but also glance upon the''Dulle Griet''(Mad Meg) which is a medieval supergun bombard constructed in the first half of the 15th century.\xa0This was employed by the city in the siege of Oudenaarde (a nearby municipality).''#22''– Groentenmarkt''Bottom photo by''Paul Hermans''/ CC''Yet another Ghent square but this time around, it holds establishments where you can primarily buy fresh products and Flemish specialties like Ganda ham, sweet cuberdons, or the Tierentyn mustard. Make sure that you visit the medieval\xa0Great Butcher’s Hall\xa0which has an impressive open wooden roof and great selections of Flanders cuisine.''.''Helpful Tips''»\xa0How to Get to Ghent?''By\xa0Car.''Belgium has an impressive\xa0motorway\xa0so it’s very easy to reach Ghent by car. Just take either the two main highways E40 or E17 and you’ll see ample signs that will lead you to the city. (These two highways intersect to Ghent).''By Train.''Likewise, Belgium has a good train system and from the capital, Brussels, heading to Ghent will only take you 30 minutes. Depending on your location, you can pick either Gent-Dampoort or Gent-Sint-Pieters for your arrival station. Gent-Sint-Pieters is the main station and all trains pass through this, whereas Gent-Dampoort mainly serves towards/from Antwerp and closest to the city center.''TIP'':\xa0Pick the “IC” marked trains since they travel faster as compared to “IR”. The “L” trains are the slowest since they travel ‘locally’, meaning that it stops at more stations.''By Bus.''Eurolines and Megabus both go to/from Ghent.''By Plane.''The\xa0closest airport would be\xa0Brussels Airport (Zaventem Airport).''» If you want a more detailed transportation planner, try using''Rome2Rio''!

It helps to note that though you may deem a country listed below as crowded, remember that the World Bank only counts tourists  who have traveled to the country for no more than 12 months (so it does not count immigrants, foreign residents, etc.). Those tourists must also spend a night on the said country, and not just make it as a day trip.''Also, you might\xa0think that most of the countries below have made it to this list because of their small geographical size, but then\xa0we can argue that''Mont Saint-Michel''which has an area of only 0.97 sqkm has\xa0over 3 million visitors annually! (Imagine that…)''Nevertheless, I know that there are other intricacies to take note of and other ways to make this list even more accurate (like making the # of visitors relative to the country’s population, etc.). Add the fact of how I can see it myself that the list gathered by World Bank is inadequate since places like the''Faroe Islands''(who can seemingly/easily be a part of this list) have no data.''Because of these and more, please take the list below with a grain of salt especially if you’re looking for''concrete and utter''accuracy.

Apart from its important political position in Europe (as the''de facto''capital of the European Union), its\xa0oddities (ever heard of the''Manneken Pis?''), and its charming small towns (I’m looking at you,''Bruges''!), Belgium is also known for its delectable food, snacks and drinks.''Say hello to sinfully-good fries, mussels, waffles, beers, and of course\xa0—''chocolates!''Fortunately,\xa0you’re in for a treat today as I share with you my sweetest affair with the world-famous Belgian chocolates. Thanks to the''Chocolate Walking Tour and Workshop''of Global Enterprises Tours, this experience was all made possible\xa0when I did another solo visit to Brussels this month!''.''OVERLOAD: Brussels Chocolate Tour''The awesome\xa0thing about this 4-hour chocolate tour is that apart from the gastronomic indulgence, their experienced tour guides will also be\xa0discussing\xa0the history behind certain statues and landmarks throughout the center of Brussels. So if you’re new to the city, you bet that this is an activity that you can do on your first day\xa0since\xa0it’s sure to be a sweet introduction to this bustling metropolis!''Available on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, the Global Enterprises’ chocolate tour is typically scheduled at 9AM. It’s only on Saturdays that they have a 2PM slot so you could say that I was lucky when my trip landed on this day (besides,\xa0a sleepyhead like me might have had a hard time waking up in time for such an\xa0early morning schedule).''The meeting point was set in the heart of the city, the Grand Place or''Grote Markt'', specifically in front of a Godiva chocolate store\xa0(which\xa0apparently was\xa0the very first\xa0store of\xa0Godiva, launched in 1926). In here, I met\xa0our tour guide, Naomi. With her cheerful personality, I was pretty sure that our tour would be setting off on the right foot!''NOTE:''They only take a maximum number of 20 people per tour and you can show up on this meeting point at the last minute (without booking online beforehand) as long as there are slots left.''Once all the participants were in,\xa0Naomi started off with a quick introduction about the area of the''Grote Markt''. Now, since I have been to\xa0Brussels for numerous times already, you would expect that I wouldn’t\xa0be hearing anything ‘new’,\xa0but I actually did especially because Naomi often had some tidbits of trivia that I haven’t learned yet!''» READ:''Top 10 Free Things to Do in Brussels, the Heart of Europe!''Rest assured, these ‘stops’ to Brussels’ landmarks were only done briefly since the highlight of the day was the chocolate of course!''And so, our first chocolate-tasting stop was to''Corné Port-Royal'',\xa0the brand that first introduced the famous Belgian chocolate:''Manon Sucre\xa0—''a handmade praline that is made of smooth cream with crisp nougatine and fresh walnuts! We had a taste of this as we set foot in the store, and it was a great delight to my palate! And as if that wasn’t enough, they even gave us the chance to pick another praline of our choice!''This was surely the start of my ‘chocolate’ pampering session and I was already very excited for the upcoming treats!''By the way, in order to arrive to this wonderful spot, we had to go through the eye-catching''Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert,''a\xa0covered shopping gallery filled with elegant-looking shops and is said to be Europe’s first covered shopping gallery\xa0as it was built in 1847.''TRIVIA:''It is here in Geleries Royales Saint-Hubert that you will find the oldest store of the notable and famous\xa0Belgian brand,''Neuhaus'', who invented the chocolate bonbon or praline. Much to my delight, this along with Godiva were not part of this chocolate tour and it’s not because I don’t want to taste them! But of course, these two brands are so heavily commercialized that we typically buy them from the supermarket and eat it in our homes, so it’s great that this tour involved more of the other famous chocolate brands here in Belgium.''Afterwards, we drifted away from the gallery and ended up in''Chocopolis''. It didn’t look as lavish as\xa0Corné Port-Royal and all the other similarly-lavish shops that we previously passed by, so I was absolutely intrigued as to what this establishment could possibly offer to us in this chocolate tour.''Though as soon as I got to taste some of their pralines, especially their Dark Cocoa Ganache''—''I was in love! Surely, you really can’t judge anything by appearances alone, and as I listened to Naomi, I found out that Chocopolis is a unique\xa0chocolate shop because their chocolate factory is already located in the building that we were standing on. This would mean that they have avoided any transportation time, thereby keeping all their chocolates fresh and in their prime original flavor! From this point on, I could definitely see how Belgians are the masters of chocolate since\xa0they really put so much importance in''quality''.''Next up, we took a break from''walking''and went on to pursue the promised''chocolate workshop''in a cozy premise just outside the center of Brussels. In here, we each had our own workshop table as we were guided by a chocolatier who helped educate us about all things chocolate! At first, she let us have our sweet time in dipping various fruits, cookies, and sweets in a pot of melted dark chocolate.''After that, she showed us how to make our own chocolate-shaped desserts\xa0so that we can\xa0decorate them with our preferred choice of ingredients and toppings like exotic fruits, sesame, sea salt, coconut shavings, and more. (This will later on be frozen so that we can take them home in our own personal goodie bags).''For a more vivid experience, we also launched into praline-making as they guided as through the simple 3-step procedure into how it is made. Since the other steps are a tad too complicated (as it is for the pros), we still had the chance to do the fillings of the pralines, and then once that was done, we were given more chocolates to taste!''…I have to say that it was at this point that I was starting to feel what we\xa0would call a''chocolate overload''.''A part of me wanted to give up, but a bigger part wanted more of some chocolate goodness and that part won. Thankfully!''We continued on to our chocolate tour and not so surprisingly, we made a stop to the world-renowned''Manneken''Pis''which was packed with tourists as per usual.''Now, I have to say that I don’t know myself what’s so special about this little pissing boy that\xa0tourists around the world flock to Brussels to take a picture of (the locals\xa0themselves wouldn’t\xa0know why either) but for sure, we ALL know that its peculiarity\xa0is amusing so I guess it’s really worth the look!''For our\xa0third stop:''Pierre Marcolini''. Naomi noted that this was the start of our chocolate tour wherein we will be visiting the more high-end Belgian chocolate brands, and I had no doubts about that because Pierre Marcolini’s shop was truly posh and stylish! From the packaging, to its displays, and up to its chocolates, they all looked like art\xa0pieces that were carefully-crafted by professional artisans! (Which I bet they are.)''After they handed out the chocolates that we were free to taste, I suddenly realized that I should start ‘stocking up’ and so it was here that I started to buy\xa0boxes of\xa0chocolates for Jonas and myself!''Next up was a brand made by one of Belgium’s finest chocolatiers,''Frederic Blondeel''.\xa0An expert cocoa roaster, he makes use of a Santos Palace Coffee Roaster that dates back to 1953. Though the process is historic, his creations are not as he paves his way into producing the grand cru of chocolates!''We all tasted some unique caramel salted chocolates, topped off with their special hot chocolate drink! And I so wanted to cry because of two things. First, it was too delicious. Second, I was reaching my peak for handling all the sweetness; but I pushed myself since there was only one store left and it would be the grandest of all!''…What else but the best artisan of chocolates:''Mary''!\xa0Brimming with flavor and creativity, did you know that Mary Delluc is the prime chocolate supplier of most of the famous Belgian and French personalities? In fact, it was in 1942 that Mary was first awarded the title of “Certified Royal Warrant Holder of Belgium” as she took the great honor of being the''chocolate purveyor to the''Royal House of Belgium''.''This award has been renewed two times:\xa0in 1990, by His Majesty King Baudouin I, and in 1994, by His Majesty King Albert II.''Knowing this fact as well knowing the tremendously good taste of Mary’s chocolates, I surely went crazy buying chocolates in this shop… Needless to say, it was the best-est ‘cap’ to this\xa0delicious and ultimate Brussels chocolate tour!''.''Overall''You might know me as one of those travelers who typically wouldn’t take an arranged tour in a new destination, since I would often want the chance to curate my own itinerary. But when it comes to Belgian chocolates, surely, I would be needing the help of those who are more knowledgeable about it; so I suggest that if you’re looking into the chance of indulging your inner chocoholic, Global Enterprises’ Chocolate Tour is an experience that you shouldn’t pass!''I, myself, had a delightful time with them and Naomi as a tour guide was a pleasure to be with!

Naturally, tourism has become\xa0the main source of income for the residents in Le Mont Saint-Michel.''A sturdy fortress''as it was built on a rock of''pure''granite that measured 84 meters in height.''Its star attraction is the abbey on top.''This structure perfectly exemplifies the feudal society that it originally has because on top is the abbey and monastery (which represents God), below will be the great halls, next the stores and houses, and at the bottom outside of the walls, are the houses of fishermen and farmers.''Just 150 miles off Paris'', so if you’re visiting the''city of love and lights'', don’t forget to stop by Mont Saint Michel too!''.''History of Mont Saint Michel''This place has a long and\xa0complicated past, but I’ll try to give you a simplified overview since it’s very interesting to know these\xa0things! Surely, it will make you appreciate and understand the structure even more too.''4th\xa0to\xa07th Centuries'': As Christianity expanded to the area, Mont Saint Michel was\xa0called as''Mont Tombe''at that time, and was part of the Diocese of the Avranches (the commune in which it is located).\xa0Around the 6th century, Christianity had a stronger presence so Mont Tombe became populated by religious devotees, hermits and even some Celtic monks.''708 AD'': As per legend, the diocese or bishop of Avranches, Saint Aubert, had a vision in\xa0his sleep\xa0wherein\xa0Saint Michael (patron saint of sailors) instructed him to build a\xa0church on Mont Tombe. He ignored this at first,\xa0so Saint Michael appeared to him again… and again (3 times in total!) that Saint\xa0Michael\xa0finally bore a hole\xa0into Aubert’s skull with his finger and ordered him to complete the task.''…Realistically speaking, Aubert should have died from this but legend has it, he survived and you bet that he built the church after going through such an ordeal! (His skull with a hole can be seen in\xa0the Saint-Gervais Basilica in Avranches, and as per science’s inspection, this skull\xa0seems to be a relic that shows evidence of''trepanation''or a surgical invention in the ancient times.)''October 16, 709 AD'': The small church was finished and Saint Aubert dedicated it to St. Michael.\xa0…Naturally.''710\xa0AD'': Mont Tombe was renamed to''Mont Saint Michel au péril de la Mer''or “Mount Saint Michael at the peril of the sea”. From this point onward, several things happened such as that of\xa0Vikings capturing the Mont in 847 which drove the monks away and which\xa0gradually made its inhabitants drift away from their religious life.''966\xa0AD'': The Duke of Normandy, Richard 1st, permitted the Benedict monks to settle in Mont\xa0in an aim of returning the city into a more monastic life.\xa0This sparked the founding year of the Mont Saint-Michel abbey as they built the\xa0pre-Romanesque church of the abbey.''13th to 15th centuries'': The Hundred Years’ War in England commenced with the Duke of Brittany leading the siege to Mont Saint Michel. The Mont held out for 30 years! The Duke massacred the village but it failed to conquer the abbey due to its stoned fortifications (but fires have damaged some abbey buildings significantly).''The King of France set forth reparations for this and gave a grant for the construction of a new Gothic-style set which added a cloister and refectory called as the “''Merveille''“.''17th to 18th centuries'': By the time of the French revolution, the abbey was closed and converted into a prison which led Mont Saint Michel to more deterioration. This prison was finally closed in 1863 and from then on, various efforts of restoration to this architectural wonder were started. These efforts bore fruit when it was regarded as\xa0a historical monument in 1874.''.''What to See & Do in Mont Saint Michel''» Walk Through and Explore''There are several\xa0highlights to see right from the moment you step into this wonder. First, the''Burgher’s Guardroom''which is now the Tourist’s Office. Next will be the''King’s Gate''which is\xa0fortified with a portcullis\xa0— I really loved this because it was the next best ‘medieval introduction’ after I first saw Mont Saint Michel from the distance!''After this entry, you will then be in front of''Grand Rue''which is the main street of this city, and it is by this point that you will witness the narrow and charming streets of Mont Saint Michel!\xa0(This is a 200 meter paved pathway that climbs progressively to the top).''Dating back to the 15th and 16th centuries, the\xa0houses and shops in this scene made me feel like I was in''Diagon Alley of Harry Potter!''It was crowded though, that’s for sure, but the overflowing number of tourists helped materialize\xa0this ‘vision’ and feeling even more. Don’t you agree?''Left photo by''David B. Gleason''/ CC | Right photo by''Discopalace''/ CC''.''What’s next to this is that close to the St-Pierre parish church, you will see the''Grand Degré''staircase that has 350 steps leading to the Abbey. This will be quite a climb and unfortunately, there are no elevators. Therefore, in a way, Mont Saint Michel isn’t so friendly for disabled people.''But\xa0before you go up to the Abbey, feel free to walk around and get lost! This island is not such a big area in itself so take your time and explore the side streets.''»\xa0Visit the Abbey''This is divided into 2 parts. First is\xa0the church which\xa0three crypts built: the Trente-Cierges chapel (under the North wing), the choir crypt (to the East) and Saint-Martin chapel (under the South wing).''Second is the “''Merveille''” or\xa0monk’s living area\xa0which is further\xa0subdivided into two parts: the East and the West. The East side was built first\xa0and has 3\xa0rooms: the chaplaincy, the hosts room and the dining-hall, whereas the West side was built seven years later with 3\xa0rooms too: the wine cellar, the Knights room and the cloister (garden quadrangle).''Photo by''Fougerouse Arnaud''/ CC''Photo by''Max Mayorov''/ CC''.''NOTE:''You can tour this area by yourself, or you can also take guided tours for 1 hour.

(Imagine that!) To add, this difference can only be about six hours apart.''However, there has actually been an event last March 20, 2015 when an exceptionally high spring tide happened (as caused by the ‘supermoon’) which resulted to a wall of water that was as high as a''4-storey building!''This literally cut off the Mont Saint Michel island, and this has become the highest sea level in the area.''(Due to copyright issues, I can’t share the photo here on my blog, but head on to''this article''and you’ll see photos of this happening!)''Anyhow, below are the photos that I took when I went up to some side streets:''CAUTION:''Do NOT attempt to make your way to Mont Saint Michel by any other route other than the causeway or bridge! The terrain surrounding the island consists of deep mud and quicksand; add the fact that the sudden tide can trap or drown you.

Lost in Translation (2003)''Destination'': Japan //''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''Some people say that this movie was about two ‘lost’ people that turned into''lovers''; but in my opinion, it was more about two strangers that turned into really close friends. Traveling can really put a damper on one’s feelings especially if they are''alone''or left alone; even more so if they\xa0don’t know the language. But this movie shows you that there’s always comfort to be found whenever and wherever\xa0you\xa0are on the road.''.''2.\xa0The Motorcycle Diaries\xa0(2004)''Destination'': Western South America //''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''A true story\xa0about\xa0two friends in Argentina, Alberto Granado and Ernesto (“Che”) Guevara, this movie\xa0retells their big road trip around the western region of South America. Beautiful and realistic, this movie will show you what travel can bring you. Besides, going by Che Guevara’s life in history, you will see how his\xa0travel experiences\xa0helped him greatly into becoming the great man that he is.''.''3. Bucket List (2007)''Destinations'':\xa0Various //''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''The movie that started the hype for ‘bucket lists’, this is a good watch\xa0that inspires you to aim for your dreams before it’s too late. Surely, it helps to have a rich friend to back you up (like how it goes in the movie) but as\xa0I always say: you really DON’T need to be rich to travel the world. Take it from me! There are definitely a lot of ways to''travel the world for FREE''or cheaply.''.''4.\xa0The Darjeeling Limited (2007)''Destination'':\xa0India //''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''There has been mixed reviews\xa0about this comedy movie; but for the most part, I liked it! The characters, though quirky, have a story to tell and an adventure that will mark a turning point in their lives. Partner\xa0that with the visually stunning\xa0cinematography and you have a great travel movie!\xa0Now, given how it centers on a family voyage, it really encapsulates the idea on''how travel can make or break relationships''.''.''5. Up\xa0(2009)''Destination'':\xa0South America //''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''A classic Pixar movie, there is so much ‘heart’ and emotional impact in this movie even though it’s a cartoon animation. And even if it started off in a sad note (which we all are familiar of, I bet!),\xa0it quickly transitions into a fun and adventurous roller coaster of events that will make you ‘''wanderlusting''‘ for your own ‘adventure of a lifetime’ towards your dreams! (The musical score is great too!)''.''6. Eat Pray Love (2010)''Destination'':\xa0India, Indonesia, Italy //''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''A popular movie in its time, this is one of those films where people would say that''“The book is better!”''But this in itself has its charm as it absolutely transports you visually into the journey of the author. Perfect for capturing the idea of searching for one’s self, Eat Pray Love is one of those movies that will motivate\xa0you to take a pause and to reevaluate what you really want to do in life. If you haven’t watched it, you should!''.''7. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013)''Destination'': Greenland,\xa0Iceland, The Himalayas //''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''A great portrayal about taking a ‘leap of faith’ and breaking out of monotony, the life of Walter Mitty will be an enthralling piece\xa0for you! After watching this film, I was truly enticed to explore the beautiful countries of Greenland and Iceland. Plus, it also made me remember how I was once on a 9-t0-5 grind, but chose to''make my ‘daydreams’ a reality''instead!''.''»''OTHERS'':''180° South (2010) – I’ve heard and read of great praises for this movie but up till now, I can’t find a copy of it… that’s why\xa0I highly suggest that if you find it, watch it!

Forrest Gump (1994)''Destination'': Mainly\xa0USA //''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''This is\xa0NOT\xa0an obvious pick for a travel movie among travelers, but when I first watched Forrest Gump, I can still remember how it inspired me to go beyond my limits and to just go out ‘there’. Apart from the numerous life lessons this film\xa0gave its audiences, it also taught me to''just''do things that I want to do, because I always have the ability to do so. (Remember how he just ran across the U.S. just because he wants to? Now that was epic!)''.''9. Lord of the Rings\xa0& The Hobbit Trilogies (2001 – 2014)''Destination'':\xa0New Zealand //''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''“I’m going on an adventure!”''You should have seen this coming. Well of course, it was because of these J.R.R. Tolkien movies that New Zealand’s tourism skyrocketed\xa0— and for good reason! It’s really majestic; add the amazing\xa0experiences and stories that each of the characters crashed head on and you might just set off on your own adventure as well (minus Sauron, Gollum, orcs, dragons, and all that jazz).''.''10. The Intouchables\xa0(2012)''Destination'':\xa0France //''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''I absolutely ADORED this French movie. Not a lot of people know this\xa0film\xa0so\xa0I typically and proactively spread the word about it! This is a wonderful piece of work, especially if you\xa0are looking for a true ‘feel good’ motion picture that centers around life and relationships. The travel part is not so prevalent, but the scenes captured in Paris and all throughout France were amazing. Truth be told, it was actually because of this movie that I mustered the courage to go''paragliding in Annecy''!''.''»''OTHERS'':''Amelie (2001),\xa0Life of Pi (2012)''.''» Travel\xa0“Chick Flicks”''Who doesn’t love''chick flicks?''Well actually… there are those who don’t like it (like me), but some chick flicks can be worth the watch most especially when they revolve around travel! So though these aren’t cinematic masterpieces, they remain to be fun\xa0and entertaining movies to take note of.''11. Under the Tuscan Sun (2003)''Destination'': Italy //''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''This is about a\xa0writer that bought a villa in the wonderful town of Tuscany\xa0— impulsively\xa0—\xa0in order to change her life after her divorce. As it is, tt’s a perfect reminder that no matter how\xa0many ‘bumps’ that we encounter in life, there’s always a point in time that everything will fall back into place. And if you’re open, things may even end up better! Watch this and you can certainly\xa0feast yourself with the beauty of Tuscany (and the Amalfi Coast!)''.''12. The Holiday\xa0(2006)''Destinations'': USA and United Kingdom\xa0//''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''The movie that probably made home exchanges or home swaps more known to the world,\xa0this is\xa0about two women who swapped houses in each other’s countries in order to take a breather from their guy-related and life problems. Along the way, they find answers to their woes and romance. (NOTE: The locations\xa0that they shot in the UK\xa0were\xa0so beautiful!)''.''.''13. Up in the Air (2009)''Destinations'': USA and United Kingdom\xa0//''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''Though not entirely a happy movie, it speaks of the realities that typical long-term travelers experience\xa0and feel especially about the idea of home and relationships; so, I still consider it\xa0as a must-watch. Sure, it might not inspire your wanderlust in\xa0a huge way, but it will keep your traveling dreams grounded and informed.''.''.''14. Midnight in Paris (2011)''Destinations'': Paris\xa0//''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''“Paris in the morning is beautiful, Paris in the afternoon is charming, Paris in the evening is enchanting, but Paris after midnight is magic!”''Even if this one is actually more about time travel, it still feels like a travel movie to me because of how it perfectly captured what I feel about Paris\xa0— magical yet mysterious.\xa0Anyhow, this movie is sure to\xa0inspire you on taking night walks\xa0of your own and to get lost in a new place, and above all, to just enjoy life as it is.''.''15. Wild (2014)''Destinations'': USA\xa0//''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''This is a true story based on\xa0Cheryl Strayed who went on a\xa01,100-mile solo hike on the Pacific Trail in order to recover from her personal tragedies. At the time that she did this, it wasn’t so common for females to travel alone so it was quite a feat as well!\xa0All in all, it’s a perfect example of how travel can transform an\xa0individual, no matter how troubled they may be.''.''.''»''OTHERS'':''Eurotrip (2004), A Good Year (2006), The Art of Travel (2008), Julie & Julia (2009), Letters to Juliet (2010)''.''»\xa0A ‘Touch’ of Danger''Much like reality, the best travel movies\xa0are not always full of rainbows,\xa0butterflies, and unicorns\xa0because there’s an element of danger too; but in spite of that, the core idea of traveling will still remain and the adventures taken by the characters can still take you on a trip! Given the nature of these movies, apart from its wanderlust-inducing scenes, I hope that it gives you some helpful warnings and tips as well.''16. The Beach (2000)''Destinations'': Thailand\xa0//''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''The movie that ushered the popularity of Thailand’s Ko Phi Phi island, this is a movie that every traveler should watch! This touches a lot on the typical aspects\xa0of travel: the tourist and expat influx, the pursuit for paradise, the commonality of the travel experience, the deviation from it, and more. A roller coaster ride, come follow the main three characters who are adventure-seekers as they seek\xa0for the secret island called as ‘The Beach’.''.''17. Into the Wild (2007)''Destinations'': Alaska\xa0//''Watch'':''Movie''or''Trailer''The true story of the then newly-graduate, Christopher McCandless, who chose to hit the road for the sake of adventure and to live in the wildnerness of Alaska.

He tries his best to survive and the whole ordeal\xa0lasted for 127 hours.\xa0Losing his hand aside in order for him to tell us his story (which, like I said for this section, wouldn’t really make you feel like going on a trip) , through this film, you as a traveler\xa0can surely learn a lot\xa0most especially\xa0if you’re planning on going solo.''.''»''OTHERS'':''Seven Years in Tibet (1997),\xa0In Bruges (2008)''PIN THIS!''How about you?''Have you watched the movies above?

But well of course, a\xa0trip to Paris will never be complete if you don’t take the time to visit\xa0the\xa0Eiffel Tower''(La tour Eiffel)''— though\xa0surely… how could anyone miss it? It sticks out like a sore thumb in''Champ de Mars''and it is the highest structure in the city!''TRIVIA:''Standing at 324m high, the Eiffel Tower\xa0was supposed to be a temporary exhibit during the\xa01889 World Fair, functioning as an entrance arch to the event. But due to its popularity, it was never taken down. Today, it is the most-visited paid monument in the world named after\xa0Alexandre Gustave Eiffel, an engineer whose company designed and built this tower.''Personally, knowing this fact had amazed me because it’s similar to the\xa0story of''Brussels’ famous Atomium structure''which was also built during a World Fair and was not intended to last long; but since everybody liked it, it remains to stand today much like the Eiffel Tower.''It’s absolutely free to see\xa0the Eiffel Tower (either from''Parc du Champ de Mars'',''Place du Trocadéro,''Montparnasse Tower and others).\xa0Though if you really want to experience climbing it, you will have to pay. To add, you have to be aware that the lines can get\xa0very long\xa0— remember, it IS the world’s most-visited paid monument!''Now, I haven’t tried climbing it myself but I know that the\xa0entrance ticket\xa0to the top is\xa0priced at\xa0€15 for adults (if you want to avoid long ticket queues, do book your ticket online.)\xa0The tower has 3 levels: eating places on the 1st and 2nd levels and the observatory platform at the 3rd level. You can climb the stairs to the top, but typically, they close those off and make visitors\xa0use the lift (hence the reason for the long lines).''TIP:''You don’t really have to go high up the tower because lounging by the park of''Champ de Mars''as you enjoy the view is already a rewarding experience\xa0in my opinion. To make the most of it, I suggest that you do a small picnic there: bring some food, wine, and a blanket! And if you have the time, stay up until dusk because it is in those moments that the Eiffel Tower truly transforms into a breathtaking structure. (They do a light show come night time).''Metro stop'': Bir Hakeim or RER Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel''.''#2''– Visit the two Arc de Triomphe (Triumphal Arches)''Yes,''two!''There’s the well-known''Arc de Triomphe de l’Étoile''in''Place Charles de Gaulle''near''Champs-Élysées''and the lesser-known''Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel''near the Louvre Museum.''Arc de Triomphe de l’Étoile''(Arch of Triumph of the Star or simply ‘Arc de Triomphe’ which means Triumphal Arch)''Photo by''hjjanisch''/ CC''Standing in the center of the Étoile (‘star’) roundabout, this 1836 monument was built in order to honor those who\xa0have fought and died for France during the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic Wars.\xa0If you stand under this arc, you will see all the names of the French victories and generals inscribed on the inner and outer surfaces.

Therefore, I advice that you\xa0try to come to the museums either''very early''or''very late''in order to avoid the crowd.

Nevertheless, as I am trying to show you in this post, you can enjoy a lot of things here for free. One of which is visiting the city’s grand shopping spots that are so elaborately and elegantly designed. Walking along these areas are absolutely at no price\xa0of course and it’s an experience that you should really go through! Some of the best spots that you should remember:''Avenue des Champs-Élysées''Situated near the Arc de Triomphe,\xa0strolling through this tree-lined avenue is a MUST on your itinerary!\xa0It is over 1.9 kilometers long filled with various cafes, luxury shops, and theaters —\xa0this\xa0is also where the Tour de France typically holds its final sprint and where the military parade is held during Bastille Day.''TRIVIA: Its name is\xa0French for Elysian Fields\xa0which is ‘heaven’ for dead heroes in Greek mythology.''Metro stop'':\xa0Charles de Gaulle–Étoile, George V, Franklin D Roosevelt or Champs-Élysées-Clemenceau''.''Galeries Lafayette''With its golden hues and breathtaking glass and steel\xa0dome, this is a department store that could act like a landmark in itself!

It helps to note that cathedrals are different from churches since for example, it is in this Notre-Dame cathedral\xa0where you can find the official chair''(cathedra)''of the archbishop of Paris.\xa0Now if you have the money to spare (typically €8.50 for adults) you can enter the cathedral and climb up its North Tower wherein you can see a good view of Paris’ cityscape and the cathedral’s iconic gargoyles!

If not, lounging around the grassy area by the 234 steps or strolling around the artsy neighborhood is a rewarding experience in itself.''Metro stop'': Anvers''.''Église de la Madeleine''Styled like a massive Greek temple, this was initially\xa0made in honor of the glory done by Napoleon’s army. \xa0Today, it stands as a church where classical concerts are regularly held. TIP: Go up the staircase to witness a Parisian panorama, and the best thing about it? Entry here is for free!''Metro stop:''Madeleine''.''BONUS''EAT cheap or for FREE in Paris!''This might sound too good to be true, but I kid you not\xa0—\xa0you CAN get a meal in Paris without paying anything! As long as you time your visit well, you can often get a free meal as long as you buy a drink first.

Just west of the city, this is a major business district that is more modern and speckled with skyscrapers with interesting architectural styles and monuments.''For example, its''Grande Arche de la Défense''is a 20th century version of Arc de Triomphe, but instead of dedicating it to military victories like the latter, the Grande Arche is\xa0a monument that is for humanity and humanitarian ideals. Also,\xa0in line with Paris’ ‘Historical Axis’, it is positioned in a way that it faces against\xa0the Arc de Triomphe\xa0because\xa0if you stand from this point, you will clearly see the arc and Champs-Élysées in the distance. So in a sense, this is the 3rd arch in Paris!''Metro'': La Défense''.''Pre-Travel Guide''Where to get the best flight deals to Paris?''My go-to platform for grabbing the best flight deals is''Skyscanner''. But of course, it’s always good practice to first research the budget airlines that exist in the country that you’re currently staying in because they could have rock-bottom prices that are not often visible in the above flight search engines.''FYI: Paris is served by 3 international airports, namely Charles de Gaulle International Airport (Roissy ; CDG), Orly International Airport (ORY), and Beauvais (BVA) — with CDG being the most popular one.''How to get around Paris?''By foot.''One of the best things about Paris is that it’s a great pleasure to explore it by foot; after all, most attractions are not too far for one another and it makes for great opportunities to see sights along the way that you wouldn’t normally see under the metro subway.''By metro.''Paris has an excellent underground train system called as the Métro (short for Chemin de fer métropolitain, Metropolitan Railway) in which most entrances are marked either with a large “M” or by one of Hector Guimard’s ‘Art Nouveau’ station entrances. For buying tickets, all metro stations have both ticket windows and vending machines (take note that the latter usually only accepts coins or European credit cards with a pin-encoded chip on front). A single ticket costs €1.90 but you can also buy tourist passes that span for 1, 2, 3 and 5 days.''By bicycle or scooter.''This is certainly a good alternative to driving, public transport, and walking and there are several places where you can rent a bike such as Vélib in which you can rent for just €1.70 for 1 day or €8 for 7 days.As for scooters, there are several Vespa tour companies who rent scooters and they usually start from €40 per person.''By taxi or private car.''Given the horrible traffic, I cannot recommend this as much. Also, taxis can get quite expensive _ but anyhow, if you want to, they usually have a €6.50 minimum fee on all taxi journeys (which is on top of your meter fare).''Did you know that one of my dreams is to become\xa0a''polyglot?''(Someone who has mastered multiple languages). It is not only a\xa0‘cool’ thing and a great mind-booster, but it is also an invaluable\xa0‘power’\xa0that will prove very useful as I travel around the world.''There is actually a LOT of debate going on as to how many languages someone needs to be fluent in\xa0before being called a''true''polyglot. Some say at least 3 while most say at least 6 — personally, I think 6 is a good number for such an ‘esteemed’ title, so let’s go with that.''So as of this moment\xa0I can speak English and Tagalog fluently, and\xa0I also speak the\xa0dialect\xa0in my hometown in Batanes:\xa0“Ivatan”. If I don’t\xa0consider the political-correctness of things, I technically know a total of 3 languages; but since\xa0dialects are usually not considered languages\xa0since they are variants of the official one, then that means\xa0I only know 2. However,\xa0I can absolutely argue that Ivatan is not ‘mutually intelligible’ or similar to Tagalog so it''IS''a language of its own. Still and the same, let’s just say that I know and master 2 languages which means that\xa0I haven’t really reached my polyglot goals yet\xa0—''it’s certainly\xa0a far cry from 6.''BUT…''The good news is, I’m finally taking the steps\xa0into\xa0becoming one! Right now, I’m taking the first ‘stepping stone’ by learning the''Dutch''language!\xa0(After this, I’m eyeing Spanish, French, and Japanese.)''I’m actually learning Dutch through free formal classes here in Belgium\xa0and\xa0I just finished my first (very) basic 2-month session. I’m supposed to take the next one this August, but due to business and personal\xa0reasons I am going\xa0on a ‘break’ that\xa0would last a total of 4 months\xa0— which is''NOT''good. Why…? Because the most important\xa0thing about learning a new language is to maintain a level of''consistency and repetition''which I won’t surely be able to keep if I stop learning\xa0for several months. (A person really needs to practice and learn\xa0a new language''every day''until they reach the point of fluency!)''Given this fact, I’ve been learning\xa0Dutch''on my own''the past weeks so that I won’t forget and so that I can\xa0get a ‘head start’… and guess what?

You have to know the fact that everyone is naturally good\xa0with\xa0languages. Truth be told, studies have even showed that adults are better language learners than kids! Which makes sense of course, because we know more about grammar and a whole lot of other things as compared to the ‘youngsters’. Plus, if you ask me, we just tend to\xa0say this because the concept of time and interaction that is needed from us tends\xa0to elude us from taking the concrete action.''That’s why\xa0as long as you\xa0have a bit of spare time — dedicating at least an hour every day to learning the new language that you want — then I can assure you that your goal\xa0will be\xa0well within your reach!

Otherwise, if you really don’t want to shell out any money, playing the games to test your brain\xa0should\xa0already be enough in my opinion.

Personally, I don’t see much of a difference between the two (except for how Babbel provides more information at the beginning courses) so I somehow opted\xa0for Duolingo which is free.

In fact, up till today I can still vividly picture the scenes that I saw and sense\xa0the moments that I experienced.''True enough, it’s not a wonder to me now\xa0why Bruges’ whole historical city center is listed as a''UNESCO World Heritage,''because it’s really\xa0an outstanding example of a living historical settlement!''To add more to this city’s personality, the hotel\xa0that we stayed in was so\xa0equally pleasant\xa0that\xa0much like Bruges, I would never\xa0stop singing praises for it… Right at the heart of the historic center:''Hotel Heritage!''.''– THE HOTEL –''Perfectly situated.''The boutique luxury hotel of Hotel Heritage is right where you need it! With its prime location, attractions like the\xa0Markt, the Belfry Tower, and the Church of our Lady, among''many''others are just a walk away in minutes. There’s truly\xa0no need for you to spend so much time on walking since everything is near — you can simply\xa0go in and out of the hotel whenever you feel like it!''Packed with character and history.''Of course, what I liked the most about Hotel Heritage is that though the outer façade just shows you a simple white-washed building, you’re surely in for a surprise once you step into the lobby! With a style that perfectly mixes that of the themes in\xa0the 19th and 21st centuries, every corner of this accommodation is sure to catch your eye.''Truth be told, it perfectly portrays how ‘historical’ it is because this building has actually been up since the 1300s. It was first a merchant’s house, turned family home, and then transformed into a central bank. \xa0It was only converted into a hotel in\xa0the 1990s when the Creyten family purchased the estate.''TRIVIA:''It first opened as ‘Hansa Hotel’ in 1994 but after a big renovation in 2002, it was rebranded into ‘Hotel Heritage’ which is a registered member\xa0of the\xa0Relais & Châteaux\xa0— an association in France that\xa0only\xa0admits privately-owned luxury hotels and restaurants by invitation. This group has a very strict standards; apart from a criteria that hotels or restaurants\xa0should have luxurious facilities, it should also have special features that would differentiate them from chain hotels. Sure enough, Hotel Heritage is one example of a luxury hotel that stands out from the crowd that’s why it has been invited by this alliance.''» Today, this hotel is owned by Johan and Isabelle Creytens.''.''– ROOMS\xa0–''With over 22 rooms, Hotel Heritage has given\xa0great importance to the design and comfort of every room since every displayed element is\xa0well\xa0thought-out. For instance, the room that we were booked in had very interesting artworks and sculptures; there was even a charming old-fashioned phone by our bedside (that works!) and an enchanting chandelier in the middle of the room.''To ensure your utmost well-being, you will also find a Nilson king-sized bed\xa0that will provide you the most optimal comfort that you will ever have. What’s special about this bed is that it is handcrafted and made with the best natural materials.\xa0\xa0With those properties,\xa0it was no surprise to me when I overslept in this''fluffy''bed!''(If you find yourself loving the bed so much, you are even given the special option to purchase it).''To date, the kind of rooms that you can choose from\xa0are:''Classic, Deluxe and Junior Suites''(''a choice between one that overlooks the theater building or the belfry tower'').''❤️''What I also love about our room:''It has FREE\xa0high-speed\xa0WiFi access and iPads!

Naturally, given the awesome coverage that was given to Bruges by this movie, I have been wishing for the chance to visit\xa0this town ever since last year! However,\xa0given some constraints in my time and the sudden surge of obligations for our\xa0online business, we had to put it on hold for the past months…''But anyhow, that past issue aside, the point of this all is that I have''finally''set foot in Bruges, and this place has\xa0without a doubt''exceeded''my expectations!''.''In Bruges''Bruges or Brugge (in Dutch which means ‘''bridges''‘ in Old Dutch)\xa0is the capital and largest city in\xa0the province of West Flanders in the''Flemish Region of Belgium''. Though the totality of the city\xa0is ‘large’ in a sense, the main\xa0area of Bruges would have to be\xa0the historic city center which is very small. But even if it’s\xa0only at 430 hectares in size, it is truly an outstanding example of a medieval historic settlement!''In fact, due its magnificence, it has gained a prominent spot on the''UNESCO World Heritage Sites''list since 2000!\xa0And as best illustrated by the map below, you will see how\xa0the\xa0historic city is\xa0oval-shaped and\xa0surrounded by stone walls.\xa0These structures were built for security at first, but had later on been improved as Bruges blossomed as a city of international trade.''FACT:''At\xa07km long, it is interlaced with canals, surrounded by reinforcements , and 7 gates (but only 4 remain standing today with the best preserved one at\xa0Langestraat, the''Kruispoort'').''Photos by''Emmanuel PARENT''/ CC''.''Given all these information, you would have a fair idea now of how small this city can really be. But don’t let it’s size fool you because\xa0Bruges can\xa0make you feel\xa0like\xa0you are walking AND living in a fairy tale town that’s straight out of a story book! With its cobbled lanes, dreamy canals, medieval architecture,\xa0and historic churches among many others, you’re bound to have a magical time here.''Unfortunately though, a lot of people are slowly learning about this treasured fact, so there are times that there’s a''constant stream of tourists''in Bruges… yet again,\xa0don’t fret!''MY TIP'':''Try to visit this city outside the high-peak season which would be the summer months of June to August. Though if you can’t avoid that, try to visit during the middle of the week and then try\xa0to\xa0stay a night.''In order to give you a feel of how our picturesque break progressed, let me tell you how our trip went!''»''Gettting to Bruges''The train is anyone’s\xa0best bet in order to arrive in Bruges! Belgium has an excellent rail system so it shouldn’t be hard for you to reach this place from the capital\xa0of\xa0Brussels,\xa0which would take about 50 minutes. (As Jonas and I are living in Antwerp, it took us around\xa01.5\xa0hours to get here).''Once you’re in\xa0the station, you have three options:''Taxi''. The fastest choice, but do consider that European taxis can be very costly; that’s why unless you have reaaally heavy bags, try to avoid this one.''Bus.''The bus stop is just right outside the center and as long as you take those\xa0that have the “Centrum” sign, it will take you to the Grote Markt (center square).''★''Walk''. The city center isn’t so far since walking\xa0would only take you 15 minutes. Jonas and I chose to do this\xa0and I highly recommend that you do so too because you can already see great sights along\xa0the way that is often overlooked!''TIP'': But if you have suitcases with you, I can’t really suggest walking since once you reach the city center, the cobblestone roads can be quite a hassle for your wheels (unless you are fine with carrying\xa0them, then good!)''I mentioned the word ‘overlooked’ because if you take the taxi or the bus, you’re bound to miss out on''De Brugse Vesten!''A\xa0scenic\xa0park or ‘green belt’ around the city’s historic center that’s also laced with canals. It even has a few old windmill\xa0houses here and there and it can be quite a sight. Truth be told, this is one of the perfect spots for you to escape to if in case the center remains to be really crowded for your taste.''»''First Inside View, Where to Stay, and A Helpful Tip:''Right from the moment that we stepped into the old city center, the vibe instantly changed… the streets became narrower and enchanting historic houses were suddenly abound! (Even if\xa0they look clean and good, remember that they are centuries old).''By the way,\xa0I did tell you that the city center was full of tourists, but at the earlier parts nearer to the wall and somewhere by the residential area, it is possible for you to\xa0have your own sweet time alone\xa0— so again, I really recommend walking if you’re looking for some peace and quiet.''Now, before we started the whole ‘touring’ spree, we first headed to our complimentary stay at Hotel Heritage and it was at this point that I learned about the awesome''Discoverbruges''Card''—''a\xa0free and personal card that is given to guests of hotels and hostels that are members\xa0of the''‘Hotels Regio Brugge vzw’''. So what’s up with this card? It’s awesome because holding this\xa0will enable you to\xa0receive reductions on most of the numerous attractions in the city! (To see a full list of these member hotels + hostels, see''here''. And for more information about the card, read''here'').''Otherwise, if you’re not going to book to any of the aforementioned member hotels/hostels, you can always opt for the\xa0official Brugge City Card that will help you in saving more from your travel fund. This is mainly because the whole package offers FREE admissions to museums, places of interest, attractions, as well as other amazing perks! (To see the rates, go''here'').''.''Top Things to Do in Bruges That We Did''Once we finished checking in to the lux Hotel Heritage, we started to embark on our exploration of Bruges! This was actually Jonas’ second time in the city so I let him do the liberty of ‘dragging’ me around. Our first aim..''»''See Grote Markt (Great Market) & The Belfry of Bruges''Grote Market:''Or simply ‘''Markt''‘ is a large\xa0market square of Bruges that packs a lot of character! It has\xa0a prominent statue in the middle highlighting\xa0two ‘heroes’ of the city during a historical clash called as the ‘''Brugse Metten’''or the Battle of the Golden Spurs. And since it\xa0is at the very center and ‘THE’ center of this city, you will see here a number of horse-drawn carriages, multiple shops, medieval-style buildings or guildhalls, and of course the prominent Belfry.''Photo by''Richard Kendall''/ CC''Photo by''moz278''/ CC''TIP'': Riding the\xa0carriages can be quite an experience, but take note that it’s also a bit expensive. Jonas and I opted to skip out on it since apart from the price point issue, looking at them was already a charming sight that adds to the overall personality of the Markt. Besides, we already\xa0had our fair share of horse rides from some of\xa0our travels!\xa0(But of course, we do recognize the fact that the feeling of riding this carriage in such a place like Bruges could be such an epic thing; so if you have the money to spare, then go ahead and try it!)''ANOTHER TIP'': It would be nice to take a seat in one of the cafés and restaurants around this Markt so that you can admire\xa0the view; but be aware that as it is the ‘center’ of it all, the prices can be a bit exuberant as well! (Much like the carriages). But if you must really need a cup of jo or a bottle of beer, I suggest that you just explore the side streets around this area since you can chance upon decently-priced shops\xa0that are still in an amazing spot.''Belfort en Hallen:''Or ‘''Belfry and Market Halls’''is a medieval (12th century) bell tower rising\xa0at 83 meters and it is surely one of Bruges’ most prominent symbols. A definite must-do for this belfry? Climb up its 366 steps\xa0in order to see the details of the clock tower AND the breathtaking panoramic view of the whole city!''I will already warn you by now though that the lines can be long, and that the climb\xa0can take your breath away''literally''due to the ‘exercise’. Nevertheless, those factors aside, it will really be worth it! Like come on, just look at these views!''Photos by''Jules Joseph''/ CC''.''INFO'': Open from 9:30AM to 5:00PM, entrance fee is at €8 (Php 400+) but can be only €6 (Php 300+) with the Bruges City Card.''TIP'':''To avoid the queue, try to go early in the morning. If you’re a family, of course it would be nice to bring your kids along, but take note that\xa0it can be quite hard for the kids to do it (add the fact that with a\xa0crowd, it could be tough to handle them in such a narrow space). Rest assured, there are rest stops along the way so you won’t have to worry about bothering other people if in case you are out of breath.''»''Witness the ‘2nd market square’: The Burg''In here, you will see a showcase of various buildings in different architectural styles! There’s the Gothic town hall, the Renaissance-styled Old Civil Registry, the Neo-Classicist former Court of Justice building, the Baroque-styled Deanery house, and the late-Gothic Chapel of the Holy Blood.''Photo by''Richard Kendall''/ CC''.''While we were here, there was a group of African performers that were getting ready for a performance someplace else and there was this one guy who was so happy whenever I would point\xa0my camera at him!)''»''Do a Canal Cruise''Well of course, a\xa0trip to Bruges would NOT\xa0be complete without this experience! It’s surely a ‘touristy’ thing to do, and it can even breeze by the city\xa0in a manner that\xa0might make you feel that it went by too fast (even if it lasts for 30 minutes)\xa0 — but I will still keep on recommending this experience because\xa0it was surely a different and\xa0beautifully ‘angled’ way of seeing the city! As a matter of fact, the ride made us see several wonderful spots that wouldn’t have been normally reached\xa0by foot.''Below, you will see the most photographed area in Bruges:''Rozenhoedkaai''which is near\xa0the''Relais Bourgondisch Cruyce''hotel (also featured in the movie ‘''In Bruges''‘) and which is where you will see the\xa0cluster of canal cruise providers.''Photo by''Steve Jurvetson''/ CC''.''INFO'': They cost around\xa0€8 (Php 400+). Opens at 10:00AM and closes at around 6:00PM (some even earlier at around 5:00PM).''One of the\xa0awesome\xa0things about these canal cruises is that the guides are multilingual, funny, and chatty!''…Well at least our tour guide was that kind of person.''Along the way too, the first notable thing that we saw was their ‘mascot’,''Fidel'', who is a seemingly lazy dog that always picks this window by the canal for his afternoon naps.''Photo by''Nuwandalice''/ CC''.''Apparently, he is a ‘resident’ of\xa0a\xa0bed and breakfast called''Côté Canal''at Groenerei (Green Canal).''Because of his adorable behavior, he has become quite a''landmark''in Bruges for\xa0years that he even made a cameo in the ‘In Bruges’ movie! Isn’t that adorable?!''UPDATE'': As of February 2, 2016, you won’t be seeing Fidel anymore. Regrettably he died because of health complications. :( He will definitely be missed! From here on out, I bet a lot of visitors will glance by his window and miss seeing him there.''Next up were more outstanding views of canal pathways with matching medieval houses! To give you a ‘feel’ of this, come see this GoPro video that I made:''Another highlight of the trip would be''Minnewater Park''or the ‘Lake of Love’ which is swarmed with a lot of elegant swans. It was such a sight! There were certain sections for sure in the canals where swans were waddling about; but it is in this park where you will see PLENTY of them.''Photo by''Dennis Jarvis''/ CC''.''TRIVIA'':\xa0Swans are also one of the symbols of Bruges\xa0and there’s actually a legend surrounding them. It seems that in the 1400s, the people of Bruges executed one of the town administrators who had a family coat of arms featuring a white swan. To punish the townspeople of Bruges for doing such a thing, the court obliged the population to keep swans on their lakes and canals forever! …Sounds like a lovely punishment if you ask me, but it’s a very surreal legend, don’t you think?''TIP'':''If you want total ‘exclusivity’, wake up waaaay early in the morning to explore Bruges and you’re bound to have a very enchanting time as you feel as though the town is all yours! (The same applies if you explore at the wee hours of the night).''»''Just Walk Around and Explore''Remember how I said that Bruges is small? I have to admit that I first, I thought Jonas was kidding and it would tire me out to try and explore everything… but of course I was wrong. Bruges’ center is really\xa0small, so I suggest that after doing the three\xa0aforementioned activities, go and just''walk around.''Through this way, you’re bound to see a famed spot in the city or a low-key one at that!''Of course you can do museum trips (e.g.:''Basilica of the Holy Blood,\xa0Choco-Story Museum, etc.''), brewery\xa0tours (e.g.:''De Halve Maan''), and other historical escapades around the city as you go (check out''TripAdvisors top-listed ones''at that) but if you’re like me and Jonas who didn’t have much time at all to spend for such activities, you can just stroll around and drop by the key places below:''Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk''– Or the ‘Church of Our Lady’\xa0is at 122.3 meters high and it remains to be the tallest structure in Bruges and the 2nd tallest brickwork tower in the world. To add more to its grandness, it is actually in this church where you will see one of the masterpieces of Michelangelo which is the sculpture of''the Madonna and Child''.''Bonifaciusbrug''– Or ‘Bonifacius Bridge’ is yet another scenic place in Bruges that can enchant you given its marvelous view of the Church of Our Lady and the Gruuthuse Palace (just near the Groeninge Museum). It absolutely\xa0has a feeling of ‘secrecy’ to it; add the clattering of the horse-drawn carriages that pass\xa0by on the nearby street and you’re sure to have a mystical time.''Photo by''Derek Winterburn''/ CC''.''Groeninge Museum''– I’m not talking about the museum that houses an impressive array of Flemish paintings, but I’m talking more about the courtyard outside this museum as it was such a great spot for lounging! (As it happened, Jonas and I took our time in slurping down our ice cream cones here as we sat by one of the\xa0cozy wooden benches.)''Begijnhof (Beguinage)''– A truly tranquil place that’s full of white-washed houses circling\xa0a vast garden covered with large poplar trees. Founded in 1245, it was here where the''beguines''of Burges lived during the last 7 centuries up until 1937.\xa0\xa0It’s sure to be an escape from the crowds but just make sure that you keep quiet because nowadays, this is a monastery inhabited by sisters (or ‘nuns’) of the Order of Saint Benedict.''Minnewater Lake''– Further down from Minnewater Park and near Begijnhof is this picturesque lake that will capture your heart. This was the ending spot for Jonas and I as we walked around Bruges and I can tell you with utter honesty that its serenity and beauty\xa0was the best ‘trip-ender’!''BONUS:''Go to\xa0Wollestraat 8 and you will see an\xa0amazing''Beer Wall''!''.''Helpful Tips''»\xa0How to Get to Bruges?''By\xa0Car.''Take the E40 highway and watch out for signs to ‘Brugge Centrum’.

Know the REALITY\xa0of a traveling lifestyle.''.''Though a traveling nomad’s life is exciting and fulfilling, it’s''NOT''as glamorous as most of you would\xa0think because the start can be really arduous and tricky! (It’s not like everyone instantly goes to''5-star hotels''once they become a traveling nomad — even if they do, the adventures, experiences, and stories are the real golden treasures that NO money or 5-star whatever will ever compare.)''That’s why\xa0as early as now, I highly recommend that you lower down any expectations that might be overly-romanticized.''To name a few of the top ‘realities’ that you will experience and that you should know of:''It’s not always full of traveling,''because you still have to work too! Unless you have a huge savings account that would let you travel for years, you have to find a profession that you would earn from\xa0while you are on the road. When I started, I chose to be a digital nomad and that took me months in order to develop\xa0myself as a ‘professional’ — looking back,\xa0a good half of my 1st year\xa0was dedicated to working. Therefore, it’s safe to say that not everyone starts having the liberty of working only''4 hours a week''(or even less) while traveling! In fact, it took me more than a year before I managed to create a business that would enable me to live like that. So remember: you really HAVE\xa0to work''VERY''hard at first or maybe even for a longer time until you manage to stabilize everything (more so when you opt to do volunteering\xa0work…\xa0but at least, you will be doing it in a beach for example, so it still works right? *wink*)''»''READ'':''5 Job Types That Allow You to Earn as You Travel the World''//''The Ultimate Guide on How to Become a Digital Nomad''.''It\xa0can get lonely and solitary.''Especially if you’re traveling alone, no matter the number of people that you meet on the road, there will still be those times that you will get vulnerable emotionally — you\xa0will start to miss your friends and family, and\xa0you might even start to feel depressed. Regrettably,\xa0you need\xa0to deal with these feelings alone; add the fact that\xa0whenever bad things happen (e.g. getting sick, etc.) you also have to tide these\xa0over by yourself. This is why I often advice you guys to not only practice being independent, but to also deal with your problems''FIRST''before setting out to travel the world. Why? Because every\xa0issue that you have will be some sort of ‘baggage’ that you will carry around with you as you go. (OTHERWISE, you can always try to find a travel partner that you can get along with for this journey! As for the ‘missing your loved ones’ part,\xa0it’s something that I wouldn’t worry about too much\xa0because it’s\xa0something that technology can fix\xa0— I haven’t been back to the Philippines nor to my family for a while now but so far, the internet really does wonders for me in bridging the ‘gap’.)''.''It can get frustrating to be constantly on the move.''Apart from the thrill and the excitement of seeing and staying in new places, there are those moments when\xa0you would wish that you have a permanent home or address to stay in… When I started, I had to change my residence a LOT\xa0of times and there was certainly a point where I got sick of packing and unpacking all the time! (In case you’re more of the backpacker type, there\xa0is that fact too that you might start to''miss certain luxuries''particularly when you spend most of your time in hostels etc.). To counter these\xa0scenarios, you can always decide on setting up a home base for a longer time or\xa0you can plan on saving up''more''money in order for you to splurge on luxury stays\xa0every once in a while. For more ideas on answering your accommodation woes, check out this article below:''»''READ'':''How to Get Cheap & Free Accommodation Around the World''.''There will be ups and downs,\xa0but\xa0sometimes, more on the ‘down’.''Locals might not be too friendly to you, money might start to be an issue, your flights could get delayed or canceled, and a whole lot more of regrettable scenarios can happen! But then again, this doesn’t come with traveling only\xa0because\xa0much like life,''sh*t\xa0just really happens''… And when it does, you need to learn\xa0as early as now to NOT let it hit you too hard. I’ve had my brand new laptop stolen once while I was on a road trip in France\xa0and it really made me sad in a way that\xa0I never imagined that I would! But then the good thing about these bad experiences is that it makes you learn valuable lessons and it helps you avoid making the same mistakes again. For this particular experience for example, I have learned the great life skill of detaching one’s self from material possessions — I learned how to let things go, and it really helps to see your physical belongings for what they really are:''temporary and replaceable.''.''.''If you want to learn\xa0more realities in order to debunk any ‘myths’ of long-term travel that you perceive, one of the things that you can do is to research\xa0and study the way that other traveling nomads live.\xa0(If you ever need more information,\xa0feel free to ask questions from me or from any other travel blogger that you know of).''Fundamentally,\xa0just always remember that\xa0there are VARIOUS\xa0types of\xa0us nomads\xa0out there and depending on the kind of path that you choose''(a''digital nomad'', a backpacker, a TEFL teacher, etc.)''you can either end up leading an''easier''traveling lifestyle or a''tougher''one.''.''.''3''.''Your plans might NOT work out.''.''It’s always important to have a plan to keep you focused on your goals!\xa0I have discussed extensively in my\xa0‘''5 Steps to Starting a Life of Travel''‘ post the planning processes that you need to take before you start traveling the world.

Months later, as I managed to kick off my online business, I found myself exploring countries in Europe instead of Asia.''Evidently, not strictly abiding to a plan turned out to be a good thing for me and it could be a good thing for you too! But then again, it might end up being a bad thing too, and I can imagine how that would suck.''But no matter the outcome,\xa0if\xa0alterations should ever happen to your plans,''DON’T''stress about it.

Ms. Rachel Harrison is actually the one who primarily runs the estate of which his\xa0second son, Julyan, with special needs currently resides.''At this point, I would have to tell you the wonderful story behind this mother and son duo! As shared to us by Ms. Rachel:''One of my sons has autism. His name is Julyan. He finds it hard to express himself and he could be violent when he has tantrums. It has been tough for all of us and there were times that I couldn’t stop crying. But I was not one to give up so easily. This was my son, and I love him and I wanted to help him out. For years I was constantly searching for ways, but of course, it wasn’t easy — it proved to be very difficult… until we arrived here in our home in the Philippines.''I didn’t know that our Zambales property, that was so close to nature, could be so calming for Julyan. It seems like children who have special needs find comfort in routine and one of the activities that my son loved to do was farming. It soothed him a lot! It was a joy to finally see my son happy and at ease. With such progress, we decided to improve this place and make it into a suitable home that he will be comfortable in. He is now 22.''Though this is Julyan’s home, we aim to share this ‘resort’ to the public too, most especially to families who have special kids as well.''Ms. Rachel and her husband have sincerely\xa0designed\xa0a life that suited Julyan. At first, the whole of the Harrison family\xa0were only visiting Zambales\xa0for vacation trips, but after seeing how Zambawood proved to be such a relaxing place for Julyan, they have converted it into his home. (He is now living in that property with some of their helpers and enjoying life as a farmer! Since most of the Harrison family is living in Singapore, they regularly go to Zambawood once a month to visit Julyan).''However, over the years, Ms. Rachel aspired to share this tranquility with others so she slowly developed the estate into a magical place that can be experienced by anyone (especially those with special children).''.''The Amenities & Activities''The Main Beach House''This is a modern 500 sqm luxury beach house that includes ample features and rooms for everyone!''Superb service''– your stay will include housekeeping, helpers, and a personal chef!''.''Games and entertainment''–\xa0right next to the living room, there is a gaming room with a big widescreen TV, a BlueRay/DVD player, a Nintendo Wii, a pool table, a table tennis table, and a wide range of movie choices. The whole house is also equipped with indoor + outdoor speakers and\xa0high speed wireless internet. If you want to use a computer, there is also a unit available for your use and you can even print stuff (which is available by request).''.''Fully-equipped kitchen''– which you are free to use. It has a gas hob, electronic oven, microwave oven, fridge, coffee machine, and even a gas BBQ\xa0(which you can put out on the deck).''.''Outdoor deck with dining area''– apart from the indoor dining room, there is also an outdoor balcony terrace where you can eat your meals in…''poolside!''In this section, you will see an inviting white hammock which is already around 40 years old and purchased from Venezuela.''.''Stunning outdoor swimming pool''– with enough space for lounging, this was my favorite place to be especially since it gives me a nice view of the sea beyond the trees! And once the night creeps in, it transforms the whole beach house into more of a magical thing…''.''Other Services''Trip to Julyan’s Pine Beach Farm''– as I’ve discussed, Julyan spends most of his days farming and if it’s your interest or if your kids would want an activity for this, you are absolutely free to visit this area! (All the natural produce used by Chef Martin are taken from this farm). If you ever see Julyan around, feel free to say hi!''.''Massage''– the estate has a separate''lanai''or lounging area wherein you can relax or have your massage in.''.''Beach Trip''– an easy walk away from Zambawood is the beach of La Paz which is one of the best beaches in Zambales to go surfing in! (Upon request, you can take a boogie board or rent a surf board; you can even take private lessons if you want to).''.''What’s more is that as a\xa0part of the experience that they would like to offer you\xa0in Zambawood, they will take you to this wonderful view by the ocean wherein\xa0they have created a mesmerizing backdrop for you to lounge in! How was it? …''Perfect!''I did this trip at a time when Jonas was traveling somewhere by himself and a part of me wished that he was there with me because everything was just so amazing. (In fact, when I showed him the photos, he was green with envy haha!)''.''The Rooms''The main Beach House has 4 bedrooms with their own bath +\xa0shower and air conditioning. (This includes 2 master bedrooms and a 5th room is also available upon request). Ms. Rachel is an architect by training\xa0and a true-blue designer, so all the things that you will be seeing in Zambawood’s beach house have all came to life due to her vision.''.''The Dining Experience''Chef Martin Bakunawa, Ms. Rachel’s Nephew,\xa0was there to look after our meals during our stay. Zambawood works with various chefs upon request, depending on their availability\xa0and it is possible to specifically request for one with an additional fee. Otherwise, their in-house cook is brilliant with home cooked regional cuisines!''Nevertheless, every meal that we had was an ‘adventure’ of its own and I guarantee that you will love it!''On our\xa0last night, they have even prepared a gorgeous set-up in the garden.

And like most love stories out there, we started out as friends. Several long conversations later,\xa0we decided join up to\xa0go on several trips given how we were both passionate about travelling. (At that time, I was based in Manila and he was in Cebu). After some adventures here and there, we went to\xa0this amazing island of Bantayan\xa0and it was in this place that Jonas ended up asking me to be his girlfriend — surely after all the wonderful experiences\xa0that we have been through,\xa0I gladly said yes!''It has been almost 3\xa0years now\xa0that we have been together\xa0and it has been swell!\xa0From adventures in Asia to Europe, hand in hand, we\xa0have lived a\xa0traveling lifestyle and have even come to build a successful online business just last year. (''We really make a great team!)''Going by our story, travel really played a''HUGE''part in our lives\xa0— it did not only bring\xa0us together, but it also strengthened the bond that we have, and pushed us to go beyond our abilities. We have truly\xa0discovered parts of ourselves, grew more as individuals, and learned\xa0a lot of things… about life, the world, and about one another (that I bet we\xa0wouldn’t have normally learned if we stayed stationary somewhere).''Because of this and more, I absolutely recommend travel to anyone who wishes to get to know another person more. This does not only apply for couples of course, but for friends and families too!''»''A friendship strengthened after\xa0a 6-week trip''By: Rachael, WanderCrush''It was in the summer of 2012 that my friend Anekka and I traveled around the world in six weeks, beginning in South East Asia before heading to the Philippines, Hawaii, and then mainland USA. It was an intense six weeks that saw us literally spending every waking (and sleeping) moment together. From trekking through Myanmar to long road trips and nights in a tent in America, it was one of those trips that had the potential to make or break our friendship. We had known each other for less than a year, so I really did not know how we would get on living in each other’s pockets.''Fortunately, our time together was what we now consider to be one of the happiest times of both our lives. We probably ‘squabbled’ on about three occasions in total, usually because I was being impatient, but the rest of the time we laughed, played silly games, and generally just enjoyed being on the road. Even the ten-hour, uncomfortable bus journeys were fun!''Our travelling styles were sometimes different: Anekka was much more trusting of people whereas I was wary. To this day, I credit spending so much time with Anekka as the reason why I became less cold towards others in my general day-to-day life. Her calm nature mellowed me and I feel that I am a much better person because of her influence. We both agree that it will be hard to beat that summer, and that we probably would not travel as well with anyone else.''»''An indestructible\xa0couple on a worldwide adventure''By: Tangerine,''A Travelogue by Brock & Tanj''Adventure and travel has always been part of our story. Brock and I have been married for 6 years.\xa0 We have been living abroad and traveling the world together ever since.\xa0 Traveling has been a part of our lives and it’s the blood flowing on our veins.\xa0 Based on our experience, we are firm believers of “traveling will make or break relationships”. \xa0You will definitely get to push each other’s buttons since traveling is sometimes stressful. There is no secret about this, only lessons learned.''On our recent Balkan road trip, we travelled to Europe for 25 days and that’s a long vacation that will drain you. Brock and I usually bicker on small things because we are just tired or recovering from a jetlag. Not having enough sleep from a red-eye flight, or just because we are tired from a long day of walking. Tired from a long drive or just simply lugging around heavy luggage and changing from city to city can really be challenging. Let’s face it; we all get grumpy or say things we don’t really mean when we are exhausted. \xa0When we are tired and hungry, we cannot control our emotions. This is when you really see your partner’s attitude while dealing with stress that comes with traveling.''I don’t blame him for that. We usually just give each other space to recover from this episode and have a temporary pause to get over stress. When we travel, we realized that regardless of what we feel towards each other, we could only rely at each other anyway! So, we talk about our frustrations, figure it out and then we move on. We know how to push each other’s buttons but at the same time know how to hash it out.''»''A\xa0couchsurfing stranger turned\xa0newfound friend''By: Audrey, Audreynaline Rush''A few years ago, I found myself at the airport of Manila about to embark on my first ever solo trip to the world-renowned Siem Reap. My phone was beeping off the hook with messages from a guy I met from the CouchSurfing website. I was a newbie to the whole couchsurfing phenomenon back then, and I didn’t really know what to expect. I had won a trip to Cambodia but I had to travel alone, so I gave the community a try. That was where I met this Spanish dude named Robery. (Define sketchy name.)''Filipinos, in general, are very conservative and cautious, so I was unsure of my decision when I told him about my late night flight details and the''hotel''I was staying at. He told me he would meet me at my hotel upon my arrival so we could go out right after. I thought this was unusually eager of him and wondered if I should cancel on this potential creep. But I was feeling adventurous and trusting so I went with it. That was one of the best decision I’ve made!''Robery was such a sweetheart! He was one of the friendliest and most outgoing people I know. He wasn’t a creep at all and I really wasn’t his type (if you know what I mean). He just really wanted a companion, and he was this passionate traveler who would drag me to interesting places of Siem Reap and get me off my lazy ass. I have met many friends from Europe through him because of his fluency in different languages and he was my temple photo buddy. In such short days, I met a lifetime friend and I look forward to the day we meet again when I visit him in Spain.''»''A trial trip that launched a year-long honeymoon''By: Mark,''365 Travel Dates''I had always wanted a year-long honeymoon trip with Camille but I wasn’t sure if she was up for it. So I proposed an idea to do a 40-day backpacking trip in Cambodia & Southwest China to see if she could actually handle backpacking.''The trip would be a series of firsts for both of us. We had no idea what each of our travel styles were but we soon found out a lot of about our tolerance with various accommodation from couchsurfing to nice boutique hotels. We temple ran Ankor Wat for 3 days. Then we took the one of the worst overnight buses to date to Phnom Penh because of the terrible roads and our seats being in close proximity with a stinky bathroom. We learned about the genocide history in Cambodia, tried exotic foods, did our first overnight hike together in Tiger Leaping Gorge -Yunan, China (Camille’s longest hike at that point), and even hiked up to a glacier. We saw fake schools on Tonle Sap and had our own discussions about poverty, scams, and our moral obligation to other people. There were other bus rides that either had a dirty toilet stop or no toilets at all.''Had I pushed her too hard into this whole travel thing? Probably, but it was all worth it.''We ended the trip short satisfied but a bit exhausted so we chose to go back home to Shanghai to rest before heading back to work, and ended up finding ourselves more in love and refreshed. As a first rugged trip, we pushed ourselves near the brink of our comfort zones and sometimes beyond it. We learned to negotiate and compromise with each other which was one of the most difficult things in our first year of marriage. In the end we treated this as a trial run which eventually became a turning point to commit to a year-long honeymoon.''RELATIONSHIP TEST RESULT:''“BREAK”''»''A group trip\xa0ushering the desire to be more selective''By: Alouise,''Take Me to the World''In 2007, two friends and I went on an almost 3,000km (1864 miles) road trip to the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas. We spent 11 days traveling together. Both of my travel companions and I were not only good friends, but also coworkers. Additionally, one of my travel companions was my roommate at the time.''We made a lot of memories on that trip, but for me it was an overwhelming experience. I need time to do things on my own, and my friends, particularly my then roommate, wanted us to do everything together. At one point my roommate and I had a huge fight over something trivial. I was exhausted and angry, more at myself than anything because even before we left, part of me was apprehensive about traveling with my friends.''Despite the negative things, we did have fun on our trip, I’m still good friends with both of my travel companions. I’ve even traveled with each of them (individually) since then. But that Vegas road trip reinforced what I already knew in my heart, I can travel with other people but only for short trips. Even then, I still need time and space for myself. It also taught me that I need to be more honest communicating what I want and what I can do when I travel.''Often I go along with what other people want, just to keep the peace, which in the end makes me resent myself and the people I’m with. As tempting as it is to travel whenever and wherever I’ve learned just because the opportunity arises to travel with someone, doesn’t mean that you should. I’m much more selective about who I travel with, and now I prefer to travel on my own.''»''A stay\xa0gone bad''By: Sarah,''Five Foot Traveler''After being unceremoniously dumped in the middle of the Argentine desert, a friend from my study abroad program and I made it to our hostel fourteen hours later than planned (by hitchhiking our way there).''The following night, upon returning from UNESCO sightseeing, we decided to walk around no-wheres-ville for a bit before calling it a night. Somewhere in the darkness my friend dropped her phone, but didn’t realize it until we were back in our dumpy hostel. While I got ready for bed, she decided to go back out with the guy working in the hostel and said she would be back in approximately 20 minutes. So, I crawled into bed while a creepy old man in my room (like 70+ years old) kept talking to me in incomprehensible Spanish.''A few hours later, as there were no curtains in our room, the sun shone in and I was instantly awake, feeling that my friend never returned. Lo and behold, I glanced at her bed to find it empty. Running around the hostel, she was nowhere to be found. We checked all the rooms, asked all the staff, no one saw her. I waited and waited and waited. Nothing. I was starting to think the worst. Could she have been hurt? Lost? Kidnapped? Raped? Murdered? After all, she didn’t have a phone.''After about six hours of panic, she came waltzing into the hostel mid-day with a grin on her face, having no idea how much fear, anxiety, and panic she had caused me. Turned out, she smoked and passed out at the guy’s house, not thinking to use his\xa0phone and let me know.''»''A friend gone haywire''By: Alyssa,''My Life’s a Movie''I had planned a volunteer trip to South Africa, and a few months before my trip, a guy I dated years ago showed interest in coming. I thought to myself “''The more volunteers the better''” and thought it would be nice to have someone I know come along.''I was SO wrong. While most of the volunteers and myself were there with a main focus on volunteering… this guy, who was also a lot older than the rest of the volunteers, had other intentions. Not only did he want to go out and party every night, but he was also the type of person who wanted to “volunteer” so that he could take photos and post them on Instagram to say he was “volunteering” when he really didn’t help at all.''The final turning point, was when he had “told on me” for sneaking food to some of the kids at the underprivileged school in South Africa. Then a few days later, while standing in a group with other volunteers, he said, “''Hey we should sneak some of our food from the volunteer house to the kids!''” It was as if he needed to be in the spotlight at all times.''We had plans to travel to Thailand after South Africa… needless to say I ended up going without him.''»''A misjudgement in Barcelona''By: Annemarie,''Travel on the Brain''I wish I had known my advice two years back. The advice is to always think twice about who to take as a travel buddy. But then again, I wouldn’t have arrived at this wisdom without having met that certain person. It started out as a wish to have a trip after graduation and when I met her through a friend we both clicked.''Booking was tedious, she insisted on the cheapest hostel. It turned out to be gross. Then she insisted we walked. Everywhere. My feet were blistered. We even shared tapas because she was the worst cheapskate there was. We never shopped. We didn’t go to museums. We didn’t take the famous furnicular.''Sure, we saw the big attractions, ticked off the must see list and the obligatory photos. That is, her photos. She had me take loads of posing photos and when I tried to give her my camera, she had already walked off. And she kept on talking. All the time. About herself. Her life. Her boyfriend. However, her being young, she soon ran out of stories and started over again. Sometimes I attempted to shift the subject, commenting on a building or maybe stopping to rest my sore feet. Oh the stories that followed about her having been in more remarkable places and having had even sorer feet.''Don’t get me wrong, we are still friends but I will never travel with her again. It goes to show that spending limited time with someone does not necessarily mean that you get along for long. One friend I had insisted on not wanting to travel with her bestie. They were just too different. So my new advice is: always check expectations. Ultimately, it is a good relationship test, if you will.''OVERALL''I''LOVE''trips that involve the exploration of big historical events. For instance, I am a sucker for anything and everything that’s related to the two 20th century\xa0World Wars!''Now, this is''NOT''because I am a fan of guns, war, nor violence. Definitely not! I simply like to revisit this part of the past\xa0because of the various emotions, stories, and perspectives involved. And of course, because of the\xa0numerous lessons that can be learned\xa0from it — one of which is to never let a World\xa0War or any war for that matter to ever\xa0happen again.''Given this fact, you can imagine my extreme excitement when Jonas and I decided to visit''Normandy, France''back in 2013 to revisit WWII D-Day landmarks and museums!''NOTE:''Truth be told, I actually enjoyed this trip more than''Paris''! This is not to say that Paris was anything short of spectacular because this city was amazing in its own way; but given my intense love for World Wars, my trip to Normandy left me speechless\xa0that in result, the other places that we visited\xa0in France had somehow paled in comparison.''To give you a brief\xa0‘refresher course’ on this, let me outline some facts that surround''D-Day''— the turning point in World War II!''In an aim of liberating France and driving away Nazi Germany, Normandy landings''(codenamed as ‘Operation Neptune’)''was the amphibious and naval plan of routing assault troops across the Channel\xa0to secure a strong foothold on\xa0the 50-mile coast of\xa0Normandy.''June 6, 1944:\xa0D-Day or ‘Operation Overlord’''(codename)''was commenced\xa0and it was deemed as\xa0the largest military and seaborne invasion in history. This codename\xa0basically describes\xa0the overall battle plan in Normandy from the landing,\xa0to the build up\xa0on the beaches, and up to the fighting stages.''It was a formidable task.\xa0Not only was it a day with bad weather conditions, but the Germans have also\xa0put up an interlinked series of obstacles on the shore composing of mines, metal tripods, barbed wires, pillboxes, and more.''(The ‘Atlantic Wall’).''Nevertheless, the Allied Forces pushed through\xa0with heavy aerial, naval, and airborne bombardment first, and then followed by amphibious landings composed primarily of American, British, and Canadian\xa0forces on 5 separate D-Day beaches with code names:''Utah Beach (Mainly American)''Omaha Beach (Mainly American)''Gold Beach (Mainly British)''Juno Beach (Mainly British & Canadian)''Sword Beach (Mainly British)''Other troops who joined the Battle of Normandy on the D-Day beaches were from countries such as Australia, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, and Poland.''The enemy was truly taken by surprise. It was still a difficult ordeal though, but in the end, the Allied Forces succeeded in breaching the walls of the Germans, and over the coming months, the Allies have expanded their foothold. (It is said that the Allies landed around 156,000 troops, of which an estimated number of 10,000 D-Day casualties have happened with 4,400+ confirmed dead).''D-Day was truly a colossal feat. In order to honor those who have taken up the courage to protect the future that we have today, we chose to revisit the past by visiting these D-Day beaches and it was a really interesting experience that I will forever remember!''.''UTAH\xa0BEACH''Photo by''Maxime SPONY''/ CC''Photo by''U.S. Department of Defense''/ CC''TRIVIA:''Given the strong currents in Utah Beach, the D-Day troops landed further south which was away from their intended landing position.

As a result, a lot of\xa0casualties have happened here and had actually been almost a failure.''This was an important capture in order to secure the port of Cherbourg which was deemed as essential in building up the Allied forces against the Germans. (Surely the Germans knew the importance of this area that’s why it was strongly fortified).''When we visited Omaha\xa0Beach, we personally saw how the cliffs proved to be a deadly strength of the Germans against the Allies\xa0— it was very high and steep!''A\xa0FUNNY STOR''Y:''We wanted to try an uncommon path from the top of the hills in order to reach the bottom of the beach; however… we always ended up encountering dead ends and steep drops.

I highly suggest that you do a trip around Normandy by car since you can then control your time and route. Plus, it’s very convenient especially if you want to stop by smaller towns that are not in the way of of trains, buses, etc. We were traveling from Belgium so it took us around 5 hours to get to the D-Day beaches. However, if you’re from Paris,\xa0it should take just 2 to 3 hours of driving (take the A13, which passes through\xa0Evreux, Rouen and Caen to Normandy).''By train.''From Paris, you can choose between Caen or Bayeux as your final destination stop (Caen takes 1 hour + 47 minutes, while Bayeux takes 2 hours + 4 minutes).''»''To get around within Normandy''…''take buses\xa0that cover most of the main D-Day beaches. All routes are mainly operated by Bus Verts du Calvados.''By Air.''You can fly\xa0directly to Normandy from a foreign location, but it’s best to land in Paris first and then just take a train to Normandy. If you’re already in Paris, it’s not worth it to take a\xa0flight to Normandy since it’s so close.''.''OVERALL''I used to be\xa0horrible\xa0at packing… well, maybe I still am, but I know that I’m''definitely''better than before!

Well because it''is''Africa!\xa0I definitely,''definitely,''want to\xa0see\xa0the wild animals in their natural state, to explore the dramatic safaris, and to interact with local tribal people!''I also want to go there in order to do something''meaningful!''You see, after watching numerous documentaries and reading various textbooks, I decided ever since I was 13 that one of my dreams is\xa0to build something\xa0sustainable in\xa0Africa — the continent\xa0that has\xa0most of\xa0the world’s poorest countries.''I want to teach\xa0African kids, develop livelihood projects,\xa0and more!''I know that I can quickly accomplish this goal\xa0by joining an existing volunteer program, and of course I will do that in the future; however, I want to stress on the word''‘build’.''Ultimately, I\xa0want an organization full of dedicated people that\xa0I will personally manage and control.

Sometimes, utter magnificence really comes with a price…\xa0Rest assured,\xa0I am eyeing on scoring a trip that would at least be around the $4K range or even lower\xa0(which I’ve heard would be possible if I go to Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego in Argentina to book a ticket on the last minute!)''…Sounds like a plan, don’t you think?

The most prominent structure is the towering (315 feet) City Hall (French:''Hôtel de Ville''or Dutch:''Stadhuis'') built back in the Middle Ages that somehow looks like a Gothic church. There are surrounding medieval guildhalls too with their individual decorative roofs and statues, and then opposite the City Hall is the\xa0Breadhouse (French:''Maison du Roi''or Dutch:''Broodhuis'') that contains\xa0the Museum of the City of Brussels.''Flower carpet''. Every two years in August, the square is filled with a huge flower carpet that stays up for a few days.\xa0It\xa0is composed of colorful begonias\xa0arranged in\xa0distinct decorative patterns.''TRIVIA:''Near this square at Charles Buls you will find a statue of''Everard ‘t Serclaes.''It is a monument that commemorates Everard, a citizen of Brussels who recovered the city from the Flemish. What’s interesting about this is that other than its history, locals have said\xa0that rubbing or touching the statue (particularly on the arm) brings luck and grants the wishes of all those who touch it! …Well, it doesn’t hurt to try, right?''.''#2''–\xa0Witness the famous Manneken Pis (Look out for Jeanneke and Zinneke too!)''Located near the\xa0Grand Place just between\xa0Rue de l’Étuve/Stoofstraat and Rue du Chêne/Eikstraat is one of Belgium’s most famous landmarks, the Manneken Pis —\xa0a cute and funny 61cm bronze sculpture of a naked little boy urinating into a fountain!''This\xa0was put in place in 1618 or 1619 and a lot of legends revolve around\xa0its origins that\xa0if you ask locals about it, you will surely get different answers.\xa0Some would say that it signifies a young lord in 1142 that urinated on troops that were trying to occupy Brussels (the enemy troops eventually lost) and this thereby illustrates\xa0the attitude of Belgians towards people who try to oppress them. Meanwhile, others would\xa0explain that in the 14th century while the city was under attack, a boy named Julianske saw the enemy forces setting up an explosive\xa0and he quickly urinated on the burning fuse to save\xa0the city. Another legend states that a boy woke up to see a starting fire by the king’s castle and he put it out by urinating on it.''…Ultimately, no one can really tell you the true and only meaning behind it, but the legends are interesting enough\xa0to hear in order to put some reason on\xa0why this naked little boy became one of the most popular statues in the country! Anyhow,\xa0what we are truly sure about is that:''The Manneken Pis has been stolen a lot of times that eventually, the original restored version is now being kept at the Breadhouse in Grand Place.''He is dressed up in a LOT of different costumes\xa0and this is done\xa0several times each week (you can see its schedule on the railings around the fountain). Sometimes, he would even be ‘peeing’ wine or beer!''Though this Manneken Pis in Brussels is the best-known, there are actually other existing ones\xa0found in some\xa0Belgian towns\xa0like in Geraardsbergen (with ongoing disputes whether the one located here is older than the one in Brussels),\xa0Koksijde, Hasselt, Ghent, Bruges, and more. There is even a Manneken Pis in\xa0Tokushima, Japan which was a present given by the Belgian Embassy.''TIP:''Try to see the girl version,''Jeanneke Pis'',\xa0that is located in\xa0Impasse de la Fidélité (a narrow cul-de-sac in Rue des Bouchers). Erected in 1987, it\xa0is currently surrounded\xa0by iron bars in order to protect it from vandalism. Aside from Jeanneke,\xa0if you have the time, see the dog version too, the''Zinneke Pis,''that was put up in 1998 and found in\xa0Rue des Chartreux and Rue du Vieux-Marché.''Rightmost photo by''John Williams''/ CC''.''#3''–\xa0Window-shop at\xa0Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert''A must-see!''I fell in love at first sight\xa0with the architecture in this shopping arcade, and I especially liked\xa0its beautifully vaulted glass ceilings.\xa0Apparently,\xa0this is\xa0Europe’s''first covered shopping gallery''since\xa0it was built in 1847\xa0— with this fact, it clearly precedes the other\xa0famous 19th-century shopping arcades such as the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan and The Passage in St Petersburg.''Housing over 54 luxury shops, this gallery has two major sections\xa0— the\xa0Galerie du Roi (King’s Gallery) and the\xa0Galerie de la Reine (Queen’s Gallery)\xa0— with a smaller side gallery called as the\xa0Galerie des Princes (Gallery of the Princes). \xa0Personally, I simply enjoyed walking through this place and\xa0I would\xa0often ogle at\xa0a well-known Belgian\xa0chocolatier brand’s''store because of their mouth-watering displays!''TIP:''The King’s \xa0Gallery and Queen’s Gallery are separated by a ‘bend’, and in this section, you will see the''Rue des Bouchers'', a famous, colorful, and photogenic pedestrian street that is jam-packed with\xa0restaurants. If you pass by, a lot of the shop attendants will try to lure you in to their establishment; however, I advise that you refrain from dining here since it is a big ‘tourist trap’. It’s better for you to spend your money elsewhere on food.''.''#4''– Take the Comic Strip\xa0Trail''…by creating\xa0your own personalized comic walk!

My favorite ones\xa0are:''Mont des Arts.''Previously a densely-populated district, it is now an elevated park that offers breathtaking view of the city. From here, you can visibly see the Grand Place and the City Hall. (Nearby are\xa0the\xa0Musical Instrument Museum, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts, and the Royal Palace).''Parc de Bruxelles.''The largest urban public park in the center of the city. It is a rectangular area that is at 13.1 hectares with surrounding structures like the Royal Palace and Belgian Parliament.''Place du Petit Sablon''.\xa0A small yet charming garden ringed by 48 bronze statues that depict medieval professions. This\xa0was built\xa0as a dedication to\xa0Counts Egmont and Hornes who were executed during the Spanish invasion because of their resistance.''Parc du Cinquantenaire''. This was created by\xa0King Leopold II to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the independence of Belgium (1880).\xa0Sized at about\xa030 hectares, it includes various spacious gardens, an arched centerpiece, and 3 museums (Cinquantenaire Museum,\xa0Autoworld [vintage car museum], and the\xa0Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and of Military History).''Serres Royales De Laeken''. (Royal Greenhouses) – Apart from the plants, the architecture of these greenhouses are fantastic and every spring, it is open to the public for 3 weeks so I advise that you take advantage of it!''Bois de la Cambre''. A part of the huge\xa0Forêt de Soignes (Sonian Forest), head over to this park if you want some serious time away from the city.''TIP:''To see a complete list of parks and gardens in Brussels, see''here''.''(If you want a taste of the east, head to the\xa0Chinese Pavilion and Japanese Tower at Laeken)''.''#7''– Catch sight of\xa0Europe & Belgium’s\xa0important political institutions''As I have previously mentioned, Brussels has been called as the heart of Europe because\xa0it houses most of the European Union’s vital organizations\xa0which are\xa0particularly found\xa0in the''European Quarter of Brussels —''the unofficial name of the area corresponding to the approximate triangle between Parc de Bruxelles, Parc du Cinquantenaire,\xa0and Leopold Park.

To name a few:''Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula.''A Roman Catholic church that has St. Michael and St. Gudula as its patron saints (which is also the patron saints of Brussels). This cathedral is also\xa0often used for ceremonies that are of national interest (royal marriages, state funerals, etc.) and this is mainly due to its importance and location in the nation’s capital.''National Basilica of the Sacred Heart.''Inspired by the Basilique du Sacré-Coeur in Paris, this enormous building does not only hold Church celebrations but also holds conferences, exhibitions, a restaurant, a theatre, a Catholic radio station, and two museums.''Church of Our Lady of Laeken.''A beautiful neo-Gothic church that was originally built in memory of Queen Louise-Marie, wife of King Leopold I.\xa0Over the years, the crypt here holds tombs of the Belgian royal family including those of all the former Belgian kings.''TIP:''To see a complete list of churches in Brussels, go''here''.''.''#9''– View the famous Atomium''Originally built for the Brussels World’s Fair (Expo) in 1958, the Atomium was only supposed to last for 6 months, but it became\xa0so popular that it wasn’t taken apart. From then on up to today, the Atomium\xa0became a major part of the Brussels landscape as a way\xa0to embody the ideas of the future and universality.''So what does this structure represent? The 9 atoms of a unit cell of an iron crystal. It was a reference to science — which was the theme of the Expo — and the use of the atom, which was in full development at the time.''Standing at 102 meters tall, you can explore the inside of these spheres (5 out of 9, with the top-most part offering\xa0visitors the\xa0chance to see a\xa0wonderful panoramic view of the city) — however,\xa0visiting the interior\xa0comes with an entrance fee. Still, viewing it from the outside is already a wonder of its own! If you have the time, I suggest that you lounge around by the surrounding''Heysel Exhibition Park''area, have a picnic, and enjoy the view of this peculiar yet fascinating construction.''TIP:''Though not free, near the Atomium is the famous ‘''Mini Europe''‘ miniature park which makes for a fun trip and photo spree!''TRIVIA'': The miniature monuments that you will see here were chosen for the quality of their architecture or their European symbolism, and most of these models took a while to make (they also\xa0cost a LOT to make)!''.''#10''– Take advantage of FREE music and theatre shows''Photo by:''iMAL.org''/ CC''.''Not only does Brussels have free museums but it has free performances too!

[And then they will]\xa0enter again for another 180-day\xa0period and spend the allowed\xa090 days\xa0in the beginning of that\xa0new period.”''This is at the most extreme but\xa0apparently, some countries had allowed it because it’s\xa0how the old rule was phrased anyway. To best illustrate this, see the\xa0diagram below:''You will clearly see how it can enable a non-EU national to stay in the Schengen period for almost a continuous 180-day period. They only have to leave the Schengen\xa0Area\xa0for probably a day or two (usually called a ‘''reset''‘), spend it\xa0in a nearby European country that is not part of the Schengen territories (like the U.K.),\xa0and then come\xa0back in again to fulfill\xa0another period.''Often times, so as not to put it in such a severe\xa0way, some would do it like this:''Still and the same, it would seem\xa0like one can stay in the Schengen zone almost in a steady manner with only short breaks of exits in between.''»''With\xa0the new\xa0definition…''…the above scenarios will no longer be possible. You can still country hop in Europe, alternating from one Schengen country to a non-Schengen one and then back to another Schengen country; however, you won’t be able to do it in such a quick and continuous manner.''Given the phrase’''at any 180-day period''‘, instead of calculating forward from the first date of entry into the Schengen Area as per the old rule, you will now have to calculate your 180 days by looking''backwards''at each time you enter (re-enter) the Schengen Area. In a way, there is like this “''moving''180-day reference period” that you have to consider.''Sounds confusing? Maybe the illustration below will\xa0make it clearer for you:''If you still find a hard time understanding this, you can always head to the European Commission’s official''Schengen Short Stay Calculator''wherein you\xa0can input your travel itinerary in the Schengen Area to ensure that you will not overstay.''.''WHO IS AFFECTED BY THIS?''As previously mentioned, this new rule''ONLY''affects non-EU foreign nationals (''also called as\xa0third country nationals)''that are:''On a multiple-entry short-term business or tourist visa''On a short-stay as a visa-exempted national (passport already serves as a ‘visa’)''.''However, be advised that the new rule does''NOT''apply to:''Non-EU foreign nationals who are on a long-term or long-stay visa''Non-EU foreign nationals who\xa0have a residence permit or any other long-term immigration permits''EU /\xa0EEA (European Economic Area) nationals''>\xa0EU:\xa0Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.''> EEA:\xa0Includes EU countries (above) as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway that are non-EU member states.\xa0Switzerland is neither an EU or EEA member but have the same rights as EEA countries therefore they are still a part of this group.''“Visa waiver agreements concluded by the EU with countries such as:\xa0Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Mauritius, and Seychelles where the old definition (''“3 months stay during a 6-month period following the date of first entry”'') continues to apply''.''If in case you are wondering what European countries are member states of the Schengen Area\xa0and\xa0who are the visa-exempted nationals, simply check''this article''wherein I have discussed all these things in detail.''NOTE'':\xa0Another thing that you should know about is that the Schengen Area requires passports to be issed within the past 10 years and have at least 3 months of validity remaining beyond the intended date of departure from the Schengen Area.''.''WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU OVERSTAY?''As a general rule, anyone who overstays will be fined or deported\xa0— worst case scenario is that the offender will be banned from the Schengen Area for a period of time (1 to 3 years) or even indefinitely!

Other than by area or hotel name, you can also search''by landmark''(viewable on a\xa0map too) and then (''A'')sort the results by distance, lowest price, highest price or TripAdvisor rank. You can even (''B'')filter it more by clicking the\xa0‘Filter’ button; it will give you a wide array of choices to narrow down the results even further!''Planning and booking your accommodations becomes a''no-hassle''process as\xa0well! You no longer\xa0need to open up''gazillions''of tabs just to collect ALL\xa0the possible hotels, hostels or resorts that you are planning to book yourself into\xa0because Yonderbound functions like Pinterest: it allows you to make your own ‘boards’ called as''Yonderboxes!''With these ‘boxes’\xa0you can:''Plan now and book later''Organize all your potential accommodations all in one ‘board’\xa0(no need to open multiple tabs and browser bookmarking!''See all the details of each hotel, hostel or resort in just one page (price, review ratings, etc.)''Change and refresh the dates or number\xa0of guests across all choices in your Yonderbox''Share it to your friends or family so that decisions can be made faster and easier!

(A commission!) To be more specific,''70% of the net revenue''is given back to you\xa0for any booking generated via your recommendations or\xa0Yonderboxes. This comes in the form of travel credit or Yondercredit that can be used on every property-booking site-wide\xa0and can be redeemed anytime!''How does it work? Strangers browsing the site would often be presented with Yonderboxes when searching for hotels, and when they click your Yonderbox and choose one of the items you recommended, you will earn Yondercredits to use for your own trip! The same applies when you refer your family or friends to your Yonderboxes when they do their bookings.''NOTE'': In the future, Yonderbound would not only feature hotels, hostels and resorts, but SOON, they will also be providing bookings for events, tours and attractions! So imagine saving up enough Yondercredits\xa0— in the end, you might just end up having a vacation that''you\xa0DON’T\xa0have to pay for!''To get you started on this, as a partner of their website, I am offering you''FREE''$10 Yondercredit''to start with if you sign through''my link!''For more information on how Yondercredits work, simply refer to their''FAQ page''.

What’s more is that they are''VERY''straight-forward with their prices since the price they show includes''all taxes and fees''.''This is a great feature because most big booking services are not so upfront; most of the time, when you think you’ve found a great deal, you’re actually not because there are still taxes and booking fees to be paid among many others.''With Yonderbound,\xa0they won’t beat around the bush and that is something I am glad for.''.''Connected to TripAdvisor''Millions of people rely on''Trip Advisor —''I am one of those people, and I bet you are one too!

No one else was willing to take him in, so even though I didn’t have much, I took it upon myself to take care of him. I had other plans in life before… but right now, I’ll do anything to support him.”''Fast-forward to our time in Banaue, I did mention that we spent a good time walking around the town which was a very rural and small community. Other than farming as their livelihood, they also\xa0sell wood carvings!''By the way, ‘''Igorot''‘ is the collective name of several Austronesian ethnic groups in The Philippines, who inhabit the mountains in Luzon. Locals of Banaue, Ifugao are one of these ethnic groups and in this photo, they are wearing their traditional attire.''After the show of these adults, let’s show the adorable kids!

Take it from me!''DISCLAIMER:''I do NOT guarantee that the\xa0pointers in this post\xa0will get you approved 100% when you’re applying for a visa.''No one''can give you a guarantee; not even a lawyer, a consultant, a travel agent, or an embassy employee. Anyone who says otherwise is most likely going to be a scammer.''Take note as well that even if you have a friend who has the same income as you do and who has\xa0acquired a visa that you are also applying for wouldn’t\xa0instantly mean that you will get the visa too. This is because every\xa0consulate considers a LOT of varying factors and the situation of your friend or any other person will\xa0not always be the same as yours.''Without the guarantee, what then can I give you in this article?''Helpful tips to\xa0increase your chances of getting that approval.''The way I see it, applying for a visa is like''dating''— you lay out everything and\xa0put your\xa0‘best foot forward’, hoping that by the end of it all, the answer will be a resounding''YES''from the other party. In this situation,\xa0I would be\xa0your proficient and supportive best friend who will help guide you on this ordeal.''So\xa0not only from\xa0the experiences that I’ve had but as well as lessons that I’ve learned from friends, here are\xa0the top\xa04\xa0things that consulates or embassies usually put strict attention to! (For\xa0each of these sections, I will provide corresponding steps or workarounds that have worked really well.)''Accomplish the requirements.''This is obviously ‘common knowledge’ but it seems like some people think that\xa0skipping out on a few documents is fine\xa0— no, it’s not. You can’t expect the embassy officers to say''“Oh okay, just come back and submit this and that.”''It’s always best to submit\xa0ALL\xa0the documents at once because most embassies would not even accept\xa0your application if it’s incomplete. Avoid wasting your\xa0time and effort; do\xa0remember that appointments are often hard to get.''TIP'': Make sure your passport is not expiring anytime soon. In addition, submit all the documents in an organized way. It helps to provide a checklist too in order to give the\xa0embassy a quick overview that you have prepared everything that’s needed (though at times this is one of the basic requirements).''Mind the details.''Some embassies wouldn’t need an interview since they will merely\xa0rely on the documents you submit; given this process, they usually put''very''specific instructions and it’s vital that you take note of those. (Examples: they would want you to use only a specific kind of envelope, or that you have to staple your photo to the application form and NOT paste it, or they want you to write\xa0in blue ink). These steps might seem ridiculous or tedious but you should do it still; don’t slack off and don’t rebel. Make it a point to read the guidelines very well which should normally\xa0be on the embassy’s website.''Only submit authentic documents.''Don’t even try submitting fake or ‘doctored’ documents. There’s a high chance that you will not only get denied, but you will also be banned.''Provide as much\xa0evidence as you can.''One proof is fine, but if you can give more, then great!\xa0It will give them more assurance to the documents that you are trying to prove authenticity or genuineness to.\xa0In fact, overdelivering is always a good thing for as long as the things that you’re submitting are relevant. And of course, providing originals are always best!''Show that you are ‘well-traveled’.''It can be through travel tickets/bookings or your passport stamps. Even if it’s not one of the requirements,\xa0it helps to show them this to\xa0send them a message that you have\xa0traveled before,\xa0that you always came back, and that you have never overstayed abroad.''INTERVIEWS'':''Your interview can affect the documents you are submitting; but surely, if you are submitting genuine papers, then there’s no need for you to be nervous about this\xa0because the questions are\xa0always basic:''what is your purpose for visiting, how long do you intend to stay, etc''. (Though depending on your answers, the visa officer can be more thorough).''At best:\xa0remember to be\xa0honest and precise when applying for a visa.\xa0Simply\xa0answer what they ask for.''DON’T''launch into a full-blown storytelling spree.''It’s not necessary for you to give out information when it’s not asked for! (Besides, the officers unfortunately wouldn’t care about your story, no matter how sad or tragic it might be.)''Additionally, wear something presentable (no need to be too formal), arrive early, be confident, and speak in English (or if you’re more comfortable in speaking your country’s language, then feel free to do so —\xa0unless the embassy doesn’t allow it).''◘◘''Do I need to purchase and submit travel insurance?''Back when we were\xa0still in the Philippines, Sam (Jonas’ cousin from Belgium) decided to\xa0visit\xa0the country\xa0and one of the places that he really wanted to see was the Philippines’\xa08th Wonder of the World:''the Banaue Rice Terraces.''Jonas and I haven’t seen it\xa0yet, so we were more than happy to accompany him in his trip.''» READ'':''Travel Guide: The Picture-Perfect Banaue Rice Terraces''There are 2\xa0ways to reach Banaue directly\xa0from Manila:''by car or by bus.''(There’s an\xa0aircraft option but that’s only viable if you own\xa0a\xa0mini plane or helicopter — which a majority of us normal humans wouldn’t\xa0have, so… yeah.)''As we were looking at these\xa0options, we all agreed that controlling\xa0our own route and stops would be the most ideal set-up —\xa0thus, we opted to rent\xa0a car.''*Cue\xa0the\xa0drum roll, please*''Ladies and gentleman, remember\xa0that\xa0something bad is''always''bound to happen when you get a rental car.''From the title of this post, without a doubt you know what had happened to us: while we were driving up the Cordillera\xa0Central\xa0(which mind you, is the highest AND largest mountain range in the Philippines) the headlights of our rental car decided to''forsake''us.''It was night time.''And well,''it''was''fun!''…with a tinge of thrill and excitement.''Truth be told, our\xa0whole ride to Banaue was\xa0eventful. A\xa0LOT of things happened to us\xa0— we didn’t only lose our headlights, but prior before that, we lost our way too.\xa0To launch this story, let me give you''the 6\xa0stages of our trip''. First up:''.''#1 EXCITEMENT''“ROAD TRIP! This will be the most awesome thing, EVER!”''Bags,''check.''Food,''check.''If it helps to mention, the sun was also finally out\xa0after days of rain — clearly enough, we have started\xa0off on a good note\xa0that\xa0nothing can possibly go wrong! (Ha-ha)''First up for our route, we took NLEx (North Luzon Expressway) since we needed to exit\xa0to\xa0SCTEx (Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway). Somewhere along NLEx,\xa0we had to stop for\xa0gas and it was then that\xa0Sam had his first\xa0taste of Filipino merriment! This merriment involves pictures.''You see, once you point a camera and ask Filipinos\xa0to smile…''we will gladly oblige.''We might even go the extra mile to make foreigners capture a good shot!''In this situation, you will see how it’s best exemplified because at first, there was only 1\xa0gas\xa0attendant but\xa0then,''voilà''…''they became\xa03!''When Sam kept snapping away with his camera,''there were suddenly 7 of them!''(They gladly left their job posts for this ‘photo session’ LOL. If you ask me, the 8th person in the photo below might just be their manager\xa0 — yet\xa0look at how he’s perfectly fine with everything!)''.''#2 DRASTIC REVELATION''“Okaaaaay… where exactly were we supposed to pass through?”''As we we reached SCTEx, I started to hear Jonas and Sam discussing in\xa0anxious tones.\xa0(Jonas was our driver; I was at the backseat\xa0and\xa0Sam was\xa0at\xa0the passenger seat). Surely, they have been talking to one another in Flemish-Dutch from time to time; but in\xa0that moment, I just knew that something was wrong.''They told me that they lost\xa0their ‘route notes’''. It was on Jonas’ tablet\xa0but somehow, it vanished; he\xa0can still remember the route from Nueva Vizcaya to Ifugao though… but from SCTEx to Nueva Vizcaya, he can’t recall.''At that point, I felt a bit foolish for letting these two foreigners take care of the ‘route research’ when I am the legit local from us three :P''In case you’re wondering, we can’t access the internet to retrieve the data and we can’t even call a friend because Jonas and I didn’t bring our phones''(we’re the kind of people who almost have no use for our phones especially when there’s internet at home).''Sam, on the other hand, had his phone BUT\xa0he\xa0couldn’t access 3G/4G since the Philippine SIM cards don’t work\xa0for him.\xa0We didn’t bother wasting our time trying to look for an internet shop, phone,\xa0or whatever — we settled on continuing ahead, relying on the road directions and the help of the locals.''(We had Sam’s Lonely Planet book for the Philippines which had a map. We also\xa0had''me''who can talk to the locals for directions\xa0because\xa0usually in these parts, it’s rare to find someone who is fluent in English.)''.''#3\xa0CONSEQUENCE''“What is up with this traffic?”''Apparently, locals’ advice can’t be too reliable since they really\xa0can’t dictate traffic.''Nor does a map, of course.''So for some reason, we ended up somewhere in Angeles\xa0–\xa0Pampanga\xa0that\xa0inevitably,\xa0as it is\xa0the Philippines,''we hit a terrible traffic jam.''To sum up\xa0this stage, I think in total, we spent almost''6 hours''in traffic, and we haven’t even reached Nueva Ecija yet''(which is the province next to Nueva Vizcaya > that\xa0is next to Ifugao > where Banaue is).''It was''that''awful — we were practically\xa0stationary 80% of the time! Sure, there were times when\xa0it finally started to ‘move’\xa0but LOL NOPE! Here’s more traffic for you guys!''Obviously with this, we have made Sam experience yet another one\xa0of the usual Filipino ‘things’.\xa0But this time, it was something that didn’t fascinate him at all; nor did it fascinate us\xa0even if we have experienced such ordeals for countless of times before (mainly in the capital, Manila).''If I may add, I honestly think that this might have just been the longest time that I have ever been stuck in traffic without any major progress!\xa0I\xa0wasn’t the one doing the driving but I was\xa0exasperated\xa0and completely sick of sitting in the car; so I can perfectly imagine how my good ol’ best friend, Jonas, was feeling.''.''#4\xa0MINOR TRIUMPH''“We’re finally in the mountains!”''Which means, that we were finally in Nueva Ecija, woo-hoo!\xa0(I have to cut the traffic story short because it’s making me tired just by trying to recall how it went for us!)''Given the nightmare that we have just been through, we had to stop somewhere to rest (and I had to pee). But our nightmare hasn’t ended yet…\xa0It appears that\xa0in these parts, there weren’t any establishments to stay in; more than that,\xa0it seemed like the people were already tucked in asleep given how\xa0there were barely any lights on.\xa0(I think it was around 9PM).''Thankfully, the horror briefly stopped when\xa0we spotted a house\xa0that was still ‘awake’. It was this quaint little''sari-sari''store manned by only two people. They were very friendly and chatty\xa0that\xa0I ended up knowing their life story!''(Apparently, the little boy’s parents died when he was small, so the girl,\xa0who is the sister of the boy’s mother, took it upon herself to take care of him. It seemed like she wanted to go to the city but she decided to stay behind and look after him. It was really admirable of her to do this since it seemed like some of their relatives didn’t want to take him in.)''Anyhow, she was also very kind\xa0to let me use their personal toilet\xa0— which, as I’ve pointed out, I badly needed.''Side note'': This is the downside\xa0of road trips for females: it’s hard to find restrooms. Men have it easy since the world is their urinal.''Before hitting the road again, we bought some snacks from them and bid them goodbye\xa0as we wished them well. (Silently wishing we too will be ‘well’ and that somehow, we could reach another town that we can rest in).''.''#5\xa0DANGER & THRILL''“Well this is quite a predicament, eh?”''The horror continues: an hour after we left the store was the time that our headlights gave up on us.''We parked by a\xa0small space beside the road\xa0to assess\xa0our situation:''We were up in the highest mountain range of the country, in complete darkness, and with no one\xa0around.''We were hungry and tired''.''Walking\xa0back to the store was not an option since apart from the fact that we were an hour away, they obviously couldn’t have helped us nor the car —\xa0they lived humbly and we wouldn’t dare trouble them by squeezing ourselves into their small\xa0home. I do have two giants with me.''Though my two companions\xa0suggested that we should sleep in the car and wait for daylight to come,\xa0I had to point out that the roads here are so ridiculously narrow… there’s no\xa0light either! We will risk our safety\xa0since passing vehicles could end up bumping into us.''It doesn’t help that\xa0our\xa0car was colored black. If you’re thinking that we should have put on our backlights as a ‘signal’, well…\xa0we really can’t keep the engine running like that.''With all of these in mind,\xa0I proposed a crazy and illegal idea to keep moving:''to\xa0tailgate a truck''until we reach a town that has a garage.''Gratefully, the\xa0two of them agreed to my dangerous idea. (Go, me!)''We waited\xa0in anticipation for a truck to come… but when one finally came, it\xa0passed by\xa0too\xa0fast that in the dark of the night, it seemed like they didn’t see us at all!\xa0Another one passed after some time and the same thing happened!''We were invisible…''In order to\xa0not to waste our chances — since they rarely, as in''rarely'', pass by\xa0— we decided to sit in the car, wait for a truck, and quickly\xa0follow one\xa0as it goes.''After another long while, a truck was in sight!''Without missing a beat, Jonas\xa0revved our engine and started to tailgate him!''The driver didn’t notice us at first but\xa0when he finally did, it was a''bloody good\xa0thing''that he didn’t approach us with hostility. He was nice as\xa0he asked''why the hell''we were doing what we were doing.''We explained the situation to him\xa0and he was more than glad to help. (Whew!) Unfortunately, he said that he can’t identify what’s wrong with our car; as we thought, we really needed\xa0to have it checked at a garage. Hence,\xa0I asked if it’s fine for us to continue tailgating\xa0him without headlights until we reach a town that’s suitable for us — admirably, he said sure!''It was a relief! But throughout the first few hours, we were very jittery!''Jonas was especially thrilled since he was the man on the wheel.''You go, my man!''…In the end, we spent almost 5\xa0hours on the road tailgating the good ol’\xa0truck diver. Yes. 5\xa0Hours.''We can’t really go fast with a big truck going uphill almost all of the time. Furthermore,\xa0we didn’t spot a single garage in the first 2 hours and every town we passed by was either barren (with almost 5 houses max) or dead (with all lights off). We can’t burden the driver by asking\xa0him\xa0to stop if we want to inspect a town or possible ‘parking space’ (he has a job to accomplish) that’s why we chose\xa0to simply continue driving.''At that phase, we weren’t driving anymore with a goal of finding a garage, we were driving because we simply\xa0wanted to reach Banaue and our hotel FAST! :P''So after those 5 hours, where were we\xa0and what did we do? Still''NOT''in Banaue but fortunately, we''finally''found a place that was ‘''alive''‘. It was a small store with a reasonably spacious backyard that\xa0buses would usually park for stops. They were kind enough to let us take a spot so that we can take a short nap\xa0(the 3 of us were tired enough to want\xa0and catch a few zzzz’s\xa0and it\xa0was almost early morning anyway, so\xa0why not just wait for the sun?).''.''#6 SUCCESS''“We’re alive! Yay! …Now let’s go sleep.”''We woke up at daybreak.''After 2 hours of frenzied driving, with Jonas skillfully maneuvering the switchback and winding roads of Cordillera, we finally reached Banaue!''Our bodies were aching and our eyeballs were about to fall out\xa0— when we reached the front desk of our hotel, we said yes to almost everything (just to get things done with) and then off we went to Sleep Land.''» READ'':''Travel Guide: The Picture-Perfect Banaue Rice Terraces''★''THE BIG REVEAL''As we looked at the route for Banaue using the WiFi of''our hotel'', we felt like doing''bad things''to the locals that gave us road directions!''(Just kidding, thank you! We are forever thankful to you guys!)''Apparently, if we had continued to SCTEx, we would have ended up in TPLEx (Tarlac–Pangasinan–La Union Expressway) which\xa0would take us away from all the neighboring town’s traffic jams. The route from then on would be easy because there are ample signs to guide drivers to the right direction towards Banaue\xa0— such would have taken us a total of only 8 hours (compared to the 16 hours that we had to suffer through).''…Still and the same'',''I quite liked this experience.''Yes. Really.''In fact, there were a''LOT''of funny parts that we always just felt like laughing at the ‘nightmare’ that we were experiencing.\xa0So, much like my companions, I didn’t regret what had happened to us\xa0AT ALL\xa0because\xa0the thrill and\xa0adventure that we got out from it was awesome in its own way!''We acquired valuable lessons too! Aside from the obvious ones like never losing route notes, taking precautions, bringing our phones etc… But indeed, the major takeaway from this experience is to…''NEVER EVER TRUST\xa0A RENTAL CAR''.''Aye?''Aye!''Credits to Jonas’ cousin: Sam\xa0Goetschackx for the photos above!\xa0♥''How about you?''Have you ever had a bad experience with a rental car before?''Do you have your own crazy travel storie(s) to share?''Did you like this article?''Follow me on''Facebook'',''Twitter'',''Instagram'', or''YouTube''and be notified about my newest posts and updates!''Banaue Rice Terraces —''an iconic and\xa0ancient landscape of\xa0the Philippines that is said to be the greatest engineering\xa0masterpiece of the indigenous people in Ifugao: the''Igorots''.''Towering to great heights at approximately 5,000 feet above sea level, the terraces were carved mainly by hand using\xa0stone and mud walls that follow the natural contours of the mountain. This grand feat\xa0was\xa0necessary because\xa0it was hard for the''Igorots''who live in these highlands\xa0to find flat and fertile land to plant crops in. Accordingly,\xa0with the presence of the terraces, it was then possible for them to cultivate rice by harvesting water from the mountaintop forests (wherein water will\xa0be trapped in each terrace pond while\xa0the excess would trickle down to the lower structures).''Needless to say, the rice terraces\xa0were important to the survival of the Ifugao people; it is even strongly ingrained in\xa0their culture since the knowledge to sustain these fields have been passed on\xa0from generation to generation. This\xa0perfectly exemplifies how humans can harmonize with nature in order to come up with a sustainable agricultural system using traditional techniques.''It helps to note that this is not the only rice terraces\xa0in the world; most can be found in Asia and there are even other rice terraces in the rest of the islands in the Philippines.''So if rice terraces can be found in other places… why then should you still see the rice terraces in Banaue, Philippines? Well, here’s why:''It’s an Eight Wonder of the World''– as referred to by the Filipinos;''“to say that something is an ‘8th wonder’ is to say that it is extremely\xa0spectacular that it deserves to be categorized with the other 7 wonders”''Covers a\xa0vast\xa0area that’s\xa0over 10,300 square km''– if these terraces’ steps would be put in a straight line, it would encircle half the Earth!''A ‘National Cultural Treasure’''– declared by the Philippine Government\xa0under the Ifugao Rice Terraces by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 260 in 1973. It is truly\xa0a''cultural treasure''that up to this day, it is imprinted on the back of the Philippine twenty peso bill (₱20) denomination. (Previously, it was on the back of the 1,000 peso bill).''It’s a 2,000 year old wonder''– as declared by the American anthropologists, Otley Beyer and Rey Burton. Be that as it may,\xa0there’s a study in 2014\xa0that says it might just be 400 to 500 years old. It’s not proven yet, but\xa0it’s said that it does not have much of an effect if there’s a later date because it does not diminish the heritage value of these terraces.''A\xa0‘part’ of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites''– (read the section ‘''A Misconception''‘ below for more details about this)''…and come on! Just look at the photos\xa0in this post; it’s a''beauty''that you must absolutely\xa0see! The other rice terraces won’t certainly be as magnificent as this.''.''A Misconception''Contrary to popular belief, the''Banaue Rice Terraces''are''NOT''a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.''They are\xa0located near the Banaue town proper, thereby making it an area that is\xa0surrounded by several modern structures. This predicament had unfortunately given Banaue Rice Terraces a low score in the criterion of UNESCO (even if in fact,\xa0it remains to have equal cultural\xa0and physical\xa0significance like the rest of the qualified Ifugao Terraces).\xa0That’s why\xa0in\xa0the end, they were not included in the''five\xa0clusters''that make up the''Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras—''which is one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.''(Of course, in a sense, Banaue Rice Terraces could have easily been a part of the group if only the modern structures were not as plenty).''What then are the\xa0five official clusters for UNESCO?''Batad''– famous for its amphitheater-like and semi-circular terraces with a village in the middle''Bangaan''– backdrops a typical Ifugao village''Hungduan''– in the municipality of Hungduan, a cluster that emerges like a spider web. They are\xa0stone-walled and dates back to 650 AD''Mayoyao''– in the municipality of Mayoyao, it grows\xa0a rare type of rice called as ‘''tinawon''‘ that’s in red and white varieties.''Nagacadan''– in the municipality of\xa0Kiangan that has two rows of ascending terraces bisected by a river''To help illustrate the Terraces in the Cordillera region, see the map below:''Not including''#4''Hapao and''#12''Mayoyao , this map shows the Municipality of Banaue.

It’s expected that young people of this generation would choose to move to the more urban areas of the country; as a\xa0result, there was a time when there were fewer workers on the fields and\xa0almost 30% of the terraces were abandoned or\xa0deteriorated. With all of these problems, all the Ifugao\xa0Rice Terraces were\xa0placed in the ‘World Heritage in Danger’ list in 2001. However,\xa0come\xa02012,\xa0they were\xa0eventually\xa0taken off from the record after\xa0national and international efforts of preservation.''To give you a peek of the 5\xa0UNESCO clusters, see the photos below:''As for the''Banaue Rice Terraces'', I managed to visit this majestic sight last 2013 during our road trip to the Cordillera region, so please do enjoy the following photos!''TIP'': Walk around and try to go higher up the road because the view could be better from\xa0there!''THE BEST TIME'': June to July are\xa0the months where\xa0it is greenest\xa0(August is harvest time).

Although the word “''romantic''” is not the first adjective that comes to mind when I think of this enchanting Moroccan city, I definitely think it could be just that. The noise, the clamor, the haggling, the smiles, the mystery, the sweetness – it is basically the destination equivalent of a wild romance.''Spend the days indulging on avocado smoothies and spiced''tagine''. Forget your watch at home and get lost in the souks without making more than a half-hearted attempt to find your way back home.

But I don’t recommend doing this especially if you don’t have savings,\xa0if you don’t know what you’re doing, or if you have no experience travelling before\xa0(you still and always need to at least be informed about the places you’re going to). Besides, this predicament usually just happens for those who live in a big continent wherein they can just cross borders, hitchhike, etc. because\xa0if you have to cross seas, you evidently would need a plane or boat ticket for that. You should also be\xa0knowledgeable about available accommodations, working options, foreign exchange rates, cost of living, language barriers, and so on.''Once you have a travel fund in mind, set with a firm mindset\xa0on making this your priority, here are the\xa04 things\xa0that you need to reflect on! Obviously, each of these sections would appear as\xa0‘''common concepts''‘''but''I have included detailed money saving tips, ideas, or steps for every heading so that you could better achieve your saving goals! (These tips would also apply if you generally just want to save).''.''Identify & Cut All Unnecessary Expenses''I perfectly know that this is a common advice and you’ve probably heard it over and over again; but you have to realize how effective it is and how''HUGE''the positive effects could be if you do this step earnestly.''I did mention above that when I was still working at a company:''“I earned just about enough to live by myself every month''” and that’s true.''However''! Once I\xa0analyzed in detail my spending habits, it was''INSANE''when\xa0I realized how much money I would still have left if I really put in some serious discipline!''To help you get started in identifying and cutting the non-essential splurging\xa0that you’re doing, remember these:''Transportation''If you don’t have a company car (that your work pays for), do\xa0consider using public transportation instead of using your personal car so you can conserve\xa0on gas fees — with the traffic and rush hour, you’re probably just wasting away a lot of your wage\xa0as you sit\xa0in your car for hours. (Another alternative:''carpool,''maybe you have co-workers or friends who are going through your same travel route to the office).''If you’re already using public transportation, try to avoid taxis at all costs!\xa0It may seem cheap at first but examine\xa0this: let’s say you pay Php 200 ($5) for every one-way trip to your office —''oooh,''it might not seem a lot, right? But if you multiply that by 20 working days plus\xa020 more instances (when you use a cab again to go back home) then that would all total to''Php 8,000''($180+) in a month! Imagine saving that!''I had this dilemma before because given my long-standing habit of sleeping and waking up late, I am often forced to take cabs to reach the office on time. This took a huge chunk off of my paycheck that’s why I changed my habits: I conditioned myself to sleep earlier (skipping on my late-night internet sprees)\xa0so that I can still take the early AM public transportation on the next day without being faced by the rush hour.''Utilities''If you live separate from your parents like me (this might be a common thing overseas, but in Asia, not so) there are lot of things that you could look into.''Your Rent'': Why not take a roommate to share the rent? Or change locations to somewhere closer to work? (So you can slash off more from your public transportation costs). Or why not move back in to your parents house? (If you do this, all the other utility expenses will be off your bill\xa0list).''Your Electricity'': Recall all the energy-saving tips that you’ve learned over the years: turn off the lights when not in use, unplug unused devices, etc. etc.''Your Landline & Cable'': Do you really need that landline? I bet you already have your mobile phone and your internet connection, so why don’t you just cancel it? And while you’re at it, take away your cable too. I don’t watch TV at all, but for you, if you do watch TV from time to time, it’s possible that you’re not actually using your cable as much because you’re at work most of the time. To still catch your favorite TV shows, think about\xa0watching them online like Netflix; or maybe, your TV antenna can already get the basic channels that you want — that should be fine!''All of Your Bills'': Pay them on time. Avoid the extra fees if you fail to pay before the deadline.''Shopping''I’m not a shopaholic but I still shop. In the past, I realized a ‘trend’ in my shopping habits wherein every Friday, I would go to the mall with friends. By the end of the night, I find myself with a bag of bought\xa0clothes…''that I eventually never wore''. I restrained myself from doing that and I always end up saving P3,000 ($67+) every week!''So imagine, if you’re a shopaholic, I bet you’ll be able to save more than me if you take control of your\xa0expenditures! Should you ever have the urge to buy, ask yourself these kinds of questions:''“Will I need these heels\xa0/\xa0shoes when I go backpacking around Asia?”''“Where can the value\xa0of this dress / suit take me if I rather put it in my travel fund?”''At the other end of the spectrum, if you’re a make-up addict, ask yourself the same questions. Besides, you really won’t need your whole big make-up kit when you go travelling around the world; it will just be extra baggage. Moreover, I’m pretty sure you can live with just one item from each type of cosmetics. Those would even stay good for long (6 months to a year) so you really don’t need to overhaul 10 different shades of lipsticks, for example. If a life of travel really is a priority for you, it should be easy to sacrifice these; or better yet, sell them off so you can reach your fund goal faster.''Social Spending''Do you like to party?''In the past, my answer to that would always be a resounding YES. I was a party girl\xa0before… I was that kind of person\xa0because\xa0it was my way of celebrating the end of a (hell) week at work. Ask my friends and they would testify to this. (Well of course, today, I still like to party but not so much as before).''This habit was obviously lavish\xa0so I decided to go for other options: I invited my friends over at my apartment to\xa0have a cocktail or drinking party (wherein everyone has to bring their own or contributed booze). And guess what? It was still fun! Or actually, I had more fun because we didn’t have music blasting our ears apart nor\xa0sweaty drunk strangers around. But if you really can’t avoid partying, consider going for''guest lists''that will cut you back on\xa0the entrance fee, let others buy drinks for you, or just''don’t''drink. Yes,\xa0you really don’t need that\xa0hangover the next day — you can still have fun without liquor. Yes. Really.''Do you like going to the cinema with friends?''Minimize it or skip it altogether. Just wait and watch for the movies online. To still bond with your friends, invite them over for a movie night so all of you could also avoid the ridiculously-priced snacks in the movies! (Or do a food/cooking night!)''Phone\xa0Plans''I actually never had these because I’m the kind of person who almost have no use of their phone since I usually just contact my friends through the internet. But if you’re one of those people who have a huge bill ongoing every month due to their phone postpaid plans, let me tell you this important word:''re-evaluate''.''Do you really need that Php 1,000+ plan? Maybe you can get by with a lower plan. Go and downgrade! In case you ever need to contact people or use the internet, just use your computer/laptop/phone in the office. To put this into numbers, if you have a plan of Php 1,500 per month, in a year you’re spending Php 18,000 ($400+)! That amount can already buy you a round-trip ticket and a month’s-worth of living expenses in another cheap country in Asia.''Subscriptions''Do you really need that magazine subscription?''Probably not.''Do you really need to keep that gym membership?''I don’t think you do. I say this because you can still keep your healthy habit without spending that much on fees! How? By just taking your workout outdoors! Though, if you’re not the kind who loves running, opt to try home exercises!''I once had a membership with''Fitness First'', but after realizing that I barely have the time to make it to the gym anyway before closing time, I decided to cancel my ties with them and just do home exercises like''Hip Hop Abs''. (The icing to the cake was that other than saving more of my cash, I lost more pounds than when I was in the fitness center!)''Food''You can stash away\xa0a LOT of''moolah''if you choose to cook your own meals at home\xa0as an alternative to getting\xa0your meals from restaurants or fast food places. (With this, you can eat healthier too!)''You don’t know how to cook?''Don’t worry, you don’t need to be\xa0skilled like a chef\xa0to be able to come up with a decent meal in your kitchen. There is a wide range of resources online that can teach you to cook fast, simple, and healthy meals. (''TIP'': Plan out your meals before you go grocery shopping so you can avoid making unnecessary purchases).''What’s more to this is that:''are you a coffee-lover?''Bear in mind that for every cup you\xa0steer clear off, the closer you get to reaching the amount on your travel fund! If you really need a cup of jo, avoid the big brands like Starbucks because you’re mostly paying for the name. I bet that there are a lot of cafes in your area that are cheaper but with the same or better quality. (Or just make your own cup! At least then, you can control how much sugar or cream you’d like.)''Vanity''Nails done, hair done…''now look at the total charge. Yep, you could have avoided shelling out that much money\xa0if you opted to do it yourself. I guess the locks trimming can’t be avoided especially if you don’t trust your hair-cutting skills, but for coloring? This is something that you can do without the help of professionals (surely it takes some care especially if you’re going to do bleaching, but it can always be learned and you can always ask a friend to help you out).''Others''This section is up to you since you probably have other kinds of expenses that I’ve missed out on — so please, do yourself a favor and scrutinize every single payments\xa0you regularly make\xa0because every coin that you can keep, COUNTS!''If I can add more tips, if you’re the kind of person who happens to get involved in a lot of events:''birthdays, weddings, etc''. then look into the possibility of making a''DIY gift''instead of buying stuff from the store. It’s a lot more thoughtful and the sender will know how much effort you put into it. What’s more:\xa0let’s talk about''habits''.''Do you occasionally smoke?''Reward yourself by giving it up. I know that it can be hard but if you muster some strength and discipline, the end result would be that\xa0you’ll be healthier and ‘wealthier’.''.''Budget & Save''After you identify the expenses that you can cut back on and figuring out the minimum amount that you need to live with, you’ll have a better idea now about the cash that you will have left after every monthly paycheck. I suggest that the''bigger percentage''of it should be contributed to your travel fund, whereas the''remaining percentage''should be kept for emergencies (your ‘safety net fund’).''You can use\xa0mobile applications like''Expensify''or''Dollarbird''(or just use good ol’''Excel''so you have better control on what you want to take note of)\xa0to stay on track with your\xa0spending habits. And in order to\xa0stay focused on your\xa0saving routine and have more ideas on how you can get\xa0more cash, I suggest the following things:''‘Travel Fund’ Savings Account''Establish a savings account for your travel fund and make a promise NOT to touch nor use it until you actually start your travel lifestyle. But before opening a new savings account, I suggest that you take note of these things:''Better to have a savings account that can be accessed online and can be used for international transactions\xa0since you will be travelling around a lot''If you’re not a U.S. citizen and dollar is not your country’s main currency, get a dollar savings account''There is the also the\xa0question whether you would need to have a debit or credit card, each has its own advantages and disadvantages but personally, I opt to choose a debit card (still, I can’t ignore the fact that a credit card can be more secure and has a lot of perks). Like what my readers have pointed out, credit cards can be quite handy especially if you convert your reward points into miles! This actually made me remember how\xa0some of my\xa0fellow travel bloggers have used their CCs to book for their tickets. Therefore, I leave it up to you to pick the best kind of card that will suit your lifestyle!''Savings Buddy''Some of us would often need motivation or an additional ‘watchful eye’ to make sure that we stay focused on a savings routine. I didn’t need this before since I can already be pretty brutal in disciplining myself (haha) but some of my friends have set up a ‘savings buddy’ to help them out, and it proved very helpful!''Basically, you can choose to:''Have a trusted friend/family member who keeps your card to ensure that you don’t touch it and to also ensure that you continue putting money on it; or,''Have a savings buddy who will join you on your journey. Each of you will keep tabs on one another, making sure that the both of you are actually working towards your travel fund''Coin Jar''Every coin helps! Especially if you’re someone who lives with\xa0currencies like Euros or British Pounds.''Moonlight''‘Moonlight’ means having a second job which is in addition to your regular employment. Obviously, you would need more cash if you want to reach your travelling goals faster and to escape your 9 to 5 job.''You can do what I did, which is to establish myself as a''digital nomad''wherein I offer my services online (like graphic + web design, marketing SEO, etc.) or you can try to work on sideline jobs like being a part-timer at a restaurant or cafe on the weekends. The possibilities are endless! But certainly, I know that it will be tiring. Yet again, the keyword to all of this:''sacrifice.''In life, we often have to make sacrifices in order to get what we absolutely want and I swear to you, once it’s all done with it will be''worth it.''»''READ'':''Examples of Online Jobs''or the''Top Websites to Make Money Online''The Switch''This is already in relation to the 1st section above wherein you cut your expenses.

It is a province that consists of a number of islands (hence its name that means “sea land”) wherein\xa0a large portion of it is below sea level but ‘reclaimed’ over time from the sea by\xa0the locals as they formed\xa0man-made hills, dikes, and more.''For our quick day trip, we chose to venture out to''Veere'', a municipality and city on the Walcheren Island of Zeeland. Jonas’ parents have been here before; they loved the harbor and\xa0the beach, so\xa0they decided to bring\xa0us here (it was summer-time anyways, so a trip to the sea is a must!).

It’s said that it has a lovely Gothic interior, but since it was closed, we didn’t have the chance to see the inside (apparently, it’s not open\xa0to the public for the most of the year. Nevertheless, the view of its outside architecture was enough to charm us.''TRIVIA'': The tower of this church is somehow unfinished\xa0(dating back from 1348) as it was intended to be three times taller than it is now.''Beside the church, there was a\xa0cistern (or''cisterne''– a water reservoir)\xa0and\xa0a group of singers were performing there during our stay; it was really nice because\xa0they significantly added more allure to the''Grote Kerk''with their angelic voices!''Now, it appears that\xa0this cistern was built in 1551 by the order of Maximilian of Bourgondy for the benefit of the Scottish wool merchants\xa0and this\xa0reservoir has a magnificent capacity of 2000 hectoliters (approx 45000 imp. gallons).''»''Walk to ‘Campveerse Toren’ (Tower) and see more of the\xa0Veerse Meer Lake''Campveerse''is Veere’s monumental defense tower that was built in the 15th century in order to protect the port of the town. It consists of a big fortress tower and two adjoining wings that are perpendicular to each other; the short wing is built along the water\xa0whereas the longer wing was built in 1700 and now includes''hotel rooms''.''In the 16th century, it was eventually turned and used as an inn and coastal light. Today, the tower (as one of the oldest surviving taverns in the country) is owned by\xa0Hendrick de Keyser after an acquisition in 2005; it is\xa0a Dutch association\xa0which focuses on preservation\xa0of architecturally or historically valuable houses in the Netherlands.''The shorter wing, as I’ve mentioned is built along the water which is actually the''Veerse Meer''lake, a lagoon that was\xa0separated from the North Sea in 1961 by the''Delta Works''system.. This was a very scenic spot, not only because of the splash of nature’s blue and green but also because of the existence of man-made things: yachts and boats.''It’s actually along the longer part of the wing wherein you will see another marina\xa0that is more populated than the one that we’ve been to before. (As seen in the photo at the top of this post). It’s a bit\xa0crowded, but it adds character to this town.''TRIVIA'':''In 1953, a catastrophe happened to Netherlands (also affected were Belgium, England, Scotland) and it was\xa0called as the “North Sea Flood” or''Watersnoodramp''. Caused by a heavy storm, the Netherlands that has\xa020% territories below sea level was the most affected as it resulted to 1,836 deaths and widespread property damage—it was actually the province of Zeeland that was struck the most.

Next to it, you will see''Het Oude Huis''(The Old House) a red-brick one\xa0which is one of the oldest houses in Veere; you will spot it immediately since it’s decorated.''Nearby, you would even see the''Koningin Beatrixbrug''or\xa0Queen Beatrix Bridge, which as the name suggests, was built in honor of\xa0the\xa0Queen of the Netherlands who reigned in\xa01980 until her abdication in 2013.''»''Chill out on the ‘beach’''Further on in this area, you would see a sandy stretch that is still a part of\xa0Veerse Meer Lake; which could technically be a beach in itself. It was a really quaint spot; there weren’t that many people either so it was perfect! (In the distance you will see some people doing water sports)''One of the notable attractions in this city that we didn’t have a chance to see was the''Museum de Schotse huizen (Museum of Scottish Houses).''This museum pays attention to the centuries-old relationship of Veere with Scotland.\xa0Seemingly, this city was once the center of profitable wool trade between Scotland and the Low Countries after Veere won the staple rights on Scottish wool in 1541 (meaning that it\xa0has to be purchased there before being allowed to be one sale somewhere else).''Naturally, these gave Scottish people a lot of privileges and their connection\xa0was even strengthened after Mary Stewart (daughter of King James I of Scotland) married\xa0Wolfert VI van Borsele, the Lord of Veere in 1444.\xa0If you’re interested in learning about this history,\xa0you can check out their''website''that has more information on the schedules and exhibits.''.''OVERALL''After finally sorting out our visa and apartment matters here in Belgium, I\xa0now\xa0have the ample time to collect the recipes + food photos that I had for the past months!\xa0Oh… if you’re a new reader of my blog, I will now inform you that my 2nd hobby (other than travelling)\xa0is''cooking &\xa0eating!''So starting today, to quench my love for''cooking'',\xa0you will see''recipes''that I’ve tried and tested in my kitchen (I won’t post\xa0these recipes\xa0a lot, don’t worry; I won’t suddenly turn into a recipe blog since I still will and always talk more about my travels!). As for the''eating''part, it’s covered in most of my travel posts and''top lists''so no worries there.''Anyhow, today, I am sharing a recipe that I got from Jamie Oliver. It’s actually meant to be done in a wood-fired oven; but since I don’t have that, I edited the recipe a bit to fit conventional oven settings. This is the''PERFECT''breakfast for me!

So after almost a total of 7 months worth of stay and visits here in Belgium, I’ve come up with this top 25 list of\xa0things that everyone should eat and drink''when in Belgium''!''»''READ'':''25 Interesting Facts I Learned While in Belgium''/or/''The Ultimate Guide of Things to Do in Antwerp, Belgium''Before I go on, there are two things that you need to know first about the Belgian cuisine:''It is widely varied'':\xa0it\xa0is mostly made up of different regional dishes\xa0with influences from the neighboring cuisines: French, German, and Dutch (Netherlands). There’s even this saying that Belgian food is''“served in the quantity of German cuisine''(which is a lot!)''but with the quality of French food”.''It’s not just about the Belgian fries, waffles, and chocolates'': though they are undoubtedly and sinfully delicious, there’s more to the country’s national cuisine than these famous snacks!''But of course, these 3 desserts will still be included in my top 25, but the rest would be the lesser-known dishes that at first, might seem not so aesthetically pleasant, but I assure you:''the flavors are superb!''Belgians really put more focus into the quality and taste of the food; so it’s definitely something that every foodie would\xa0go crazy for.''Now if you don’t know this yet,\xa0Belgium has 3 official languages which are:\xa0Flemish (a local dialect of Dutch), French, and German. Naturally, food and drinks would be listed in these languages but a majority of the restaurants just use the''Flemish''and''French''translation (which I will indicate for each number; though sometimes I will still keep the pure\xa0Dutch translation).''Let’s start!''SWEETS, SNACKS, & DESSERTS''#1''Belgian Fries''Frieten''or''Frietjes''/''Frites''This is my favorite fries in the world! Don’t call it “''French Fries''” though, because it’s definitely not ‘French’ and Belgians might not like it if you call it that. There’s actually an ongoing dispute about where fries originated (Belgium or France) but there’s strong evidence that it was first made in Belgium since there were records of it dating back to 1680 wherein France only had records\xa0of for as early as the\xa01770s. With this, Belgians argue that the\xa0reason why it’s called ‘French Fries’ today is because of how the Americans during WWI (who were eating the snack)\xa0mistakenly had the feeling that they were in France—the Belgian soldiers and citizens around them at that time were predominantly speaking French.''All that history aside, one thing that we can definitely agree on is that Belgian Fries are''awesome.''The secret is double frying of course; ensuring that it’s soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. An interesting thing about this though is that Belgians love dipping it in''mayonnaise''instead of ketchup. It might sound weird at first but after trying it out, it’s actually a great combination!''(They actually have different dips for their fried stuff and one\xa0dip that you should try is\xa0Andalouse;\xa0a special Belgian sauce made up of\xa0mayonnaise, tomato paste, and peppers! It’s\xa0sooooo good!)''#2''Belgian\xa0Chocolates''Chocolade''/''Chocolat''It’s just utterly\xa0divine that every other country in the world tries to smack a ‘Belgian chocolate’ label on their product as they try to\xa0imitate and replicate the real thing… yet no one will ever beat the chocolate here.''NO ONE!''The Belgians simply perfected this type of gourmet that it’s a must to try one of the famous brands like''Neuhaus''(the inventor of the ‘praline‘),''Godiva, Leonidas,''and''Nirvana''. Though of course, there are a more brands and shops in Belgium (like''Marcolini'',''Wittamer'', etc.) that can definitely make you cry with joy. (In fact, there are over 2,000 chocolatiers here!!!)''To add to the frenzy of chocolate, I even noticed that there are various things here that they try to put chocolate into—''which is expected''—and Belgians love it themselves\xa0(''duh'')\xa0though I do notice that they often eat chocolate… like a LOT! For breakfast, after tea, after coffee, etc. (It’s actually only in Belgium that I experienced being given a piece of chocolate whenever I order coffee or tea.)''#3''Waffles''Wafel''/''Gauffre''For this, it’s important to remember that there’s''NO''such thing as a ‘Belgian Waffle’\xa0in Belgium since that is rather a type of waffle that’s coined in North America. So naturally, you won’t ever find a ‘Belgian Waffle’ type here in Belgium since they have a LOT of varieties, 3 of the most common ones are:''Images from\xa0brugeswaffles.com & acemal.com''Liège Waffles''– richer, denser, sweeter, and chewier. It has pearl sugars and is the most prevalent\xa0type of waffle available; often prepared in plain, vanilla, and cinnamon varieties\xa0and can be topped with cream, chocolate, fruits, ice cream, etc.''Brussels Waffles''– bigger, lighter, crispier and have larger pockets. It’s easily identified given that it’s rectangular.''Galettes\xa0campinoises''– thinner but rigid\xa0and\xa0crunchy. It’s buttery, crumbly and soft in the mouth (not to be mistaken with the French galettes which are like pancakes).''#4''Fry Shacks (Fast Food)''Frituur''/''Friterie''If McDonalds is the first thing that comes to your mind when it comes to''fast food'', here in Belgium, it would rather be the''frituur''and they are insanely popular (which makes sense because these are the ones that sell Belgian fries; with this, it makes me wonder actually, why McDonalds is even here—then again they’re not a lot in numbers, and their stronger competitor/equivalent that is more in numbers\xa0would rather be the Belgian-owned fast food chain:''Quick'').''So other than fries, what you can also see in a''frituur''are numerous types of\xa0fried meat. My favorites would be the''frikandel''or''curryworst''(I am a sucker for special curryworst which has added fresh onions and lots of ketchup + mayonnaise),''bitterballen'',''boulet'',''Mexicano'', and''kroketten!''They also have a wide range of dips to choose from!\xa0Aside from the already mentioned ketchup, mayonnaise and Andalouse, they also have curry ketchup, tartar sauce, cocktail Whisky sause, andalouse, American, samurai, riche, Mexican, oriental, Brazil, béarnaise or Diablo.''#5''Rice Tart''Rijsttaart''/''Tarte au Riz''(Originated in Verviers near Liège – Walloon [south]\xa0part of Belgium)''One of my favorites!''It’s made into\xa0small tarts\xa0like this, but there are big pie\xa0versions in bakeries. Basically, it’s like a custard mix of rice\xa0and\xa0milk/cream which is then glazed with egg. It’s sweet but very heavenly!''#6''Liège syrup''Luikse siroop''/''Sirop de Liège''As the name goes, it’s a syrup from Liège; but actually, more like jam or sticky brown jelly. It’s made from evaporated fruit juices like apples, pears, and dates (other fruit juices may be used too).''It’s primarily used as a spread for breads or tartines (open-faced sandwiches) that is accompanied with cheese. Otherwise it is used as a sauce or part of a sauce for some meat dishes or as toppings for waffles and pancakes.''#7''Speculoos''Speculaas''/''Spéculoos''You must have heard of speculoos! I mean you should have. Well then, it’s time for you to know that it originated in the Netherlands and Belgium since it’s customarily\xa0served on December 5 and 6 to celebrate St. Nicholas’ Day (it was created in the shape of St. Nicholas).''Today, it’s still made on St. Nicholas’ Day but more commercially available in small biscuit cuts. If you haven’t tasted this yet (you should!) they are spiced\xa0shortcrust biscuits wherein the mixture of spice is called as''‘speculaaskruiden’''(consisting of\xa0at least cinnamon, cloves, mace, ginger, pepper, cardamom, coriander, anise seeds and nutmeg). To identify different speculoos biscuits, know that the Dutch speculoos is more cake-like, Belgian speculoos is more heavily-spiced in thin cookies, while the German speculoos (served on St. Nicholas Day in the westernmost parts only) are cookie-like but less spiced.''I noticed that Belgians would sometimes\xa0dip these speculoos cookies in their tea/coffee/water and then spread it along a slice of bread (which would then become its spread).''TRIVIA:''The well-known speculoos spreads (creamy, granular or crunchy) that are\xa0popular today was actually\xa0started in Belgium and it was in 2008 that it gained worldwide fame\xa0when some contestants in a Belgian TV show made them.''#8''“Lard\xa0Balls”\xa0(also called Dutch Doughnuts or Dutchies)''Smoutebollen''/''Croustillons''Also famous\xa0in the Netherlands, these are deep-fried balls made of sweet dough. It’s often sprinkled with powdered sugar and served in paper cones\xa0(normally\xa0found in fair grounds and in''Christmas markets'')''#9''Sandwiches''Broodjes''/''Sandwich''This is actually not a ‘Belgian cuisine’ since it’s universal and eminent\xa0in most of Europe; however, if you want to experience a ‘Belgian thing’ and eat like the Belgians do, there are a lot of sandwich shops\xa0that\xa0have a LOT of choices for bread type, toppings, and spreads.''(I am in love with how fresh their bread is!)''Personally, I always order a\xa0brown sandwich bread with salad in the style of:''martino''(which I will discuss later on in one of the numbers below). One trivia that you should know is that Belgians usually have these sandwiches as a meal; they have a light one\xa0for breakfast (NOT waffles; it’s rather\xa0bread with spreads, meat, etc.), a medium one\xa0for lunch (these''broodjes'') and then a heavy one\xa0for dinner (mostly potatoes with meat +\xa0vegetables).''.''APPETIZERS''#10''Charcuterie''Charcuterie\xa0is actually a form of meat preservation that produces forcemeat, sausages, galantine, etc.\xa0and it is one of the ways of cooking in France. However, Belgians have this in their diet too but more primarily composed of smoked ham slices and\xa0pâté. (The south of Belgium, Ardennes, is renowned for this kind of food).''Another kind of\xa0pâté that you might have heard of is the Brussels\xa0pâté which is a paste of ground pork liver. This is customarily\xa0paired with bread, cheese, and sausages—a good composition for\xa0a meal or snack!''#11''Tomato with Shrimps''Tomaat garnaal''/''Tomate-crevette''These shrimps are very juicy and tasty! They are tiny grey shrimps known as the ‘''caviar of the North Sea''‘ and in this, they are frequently\xa0served in a salad stuffed inside a tomato. However they can also be just on top of a salad mixed with mayonnaise and spices, just eaten directly with no mixes, or served unpeeled (commonly\xa0accompanied with a good Belgian beer!)''#12''Steak Tartare''“Martino”''/''Préparé, or Filet Américain''Steak tartare is basically made from finely chopped, crushed, or minced raw lean beef steak. In Belgium it is served with onions and more spices than the regular steak tartare. Other than spreading it on bread slices, it is also used as a sauce for fries; however, I rather want\xa0this steak tartare to be\xa0in\xa0the popular sandwich called ‘''martino''‘ which constitutes martino sauce (that has a hint of tabasco, otherwise you can just have ketchup and/or mayonnaise as sauce), onions, pickles and salad.''It is soooo good!''NOTE:''There\xa0are health concerns given how this is made of raw beef, however it is generally safe since the preparation is made clean; there’s very low chance of bacterial infection here. But\xa0if you’re pregnant or suffering from a illness, keep away from this\xa0since\xa0at your current state, you are\xa0more susceptible to risks of infection.''.''SAVORY''#13''Mussels (with Fries)''Mosselen met friet''/''Moules-frites''The unofficial national dish of Belgium:''mussels with fries!''It sounds like an odd combination, I know, but it really works.''Other than this combo, mussels are prepared in a lot of ways here: it can be natural, in a garlic cream, or in a form called ‘Moules marinière’ (like the photo above: it has white wine, shallots, parsley and butter—this\xa0broth is amazing.)''#14''Gratin with Chicory''Gegratineerde witloof''/''Chicons au gratin''This is a kind of main meal\xa0made of potato gratin with\xa0endives or chicory, typically in béchamel sauce with cheese. A ‘Belgian way’ of preparing this is that the endives are each wrapped in a slice of ham, topped with gratin, béchamel sauce, and melted cheese (also called''Witloof met hesp''). So how about that for a peculiar\xa0kind of gratin?''#15''Blood Sausage''Bloedworst (Pensen or Beuling)''/''Boudin''This is a type of meat sausage that, as the name goes, is mixed with blood (it also has breadcrumbs). The mention of ‘blood’ might scare you from this but give it a try! It’s delicious in its own way; it is grilled, sauteed, barbecued or eaten raw and best served\xa0with potatoes and apple sauce.''#16''White Sausage''Witte pens''/''Boudin blanc''If you really don’t like the blood sausage, here’s the alternative for you: white sausage made of pork without the blood, but with milk. So the relish\xa0for this one will be more delicate. I love eating this for breakfast!\xa0Belgians in general,\xa0grill or saute this and mix it with mashed potatoes or apple compote.''In some regions, these white sausages have green bits as\xa0they are speckled with spices like parsley or chives; but near Antwerp, they are purely white.''#17''Stoemp''A typical fare\xa0in Flanders (north of Belgium):''stoemp''is made of mashed potatoes with vegetables like celery, shallots, and onions. Some restaurants offer this with cream and/or milk and then\xa0paired with bacon, fried egg, sausage, minced beef, fish, or even horse (yes, they eat horse meat here too!

Haha! Can’t blame you, I did try to mislead you with the title. *pats myself on the back*''Anyhow,\xa0I hope you’d\xa0still\xa0stick around especially if you’re curious about''Amsterdam’s''famous and largest Red Light District (RLD) called as''De Wallen''(which I have visited just months ago). Up till now, I can still remember how\xa0surreal it was\xa0and I would like to\xa0share with you\xa0the\xa0reactions and experiences that I had.''And yes it really\xa0was my first time to step into such a place\xa0because in Asia, though our RLDs are equally ‘famous’ they are not the kind of\xa0tourist attractions\xa0that the general public would look out for\xa0(unless you’re a man or woman seeking for the other kind of tourism:''sex tourism'').\xa0Simply put: it’s a shady business, which is much like everything else in the world. For example, the ones we have back in the Philippines are disguised as bars, KTVs, massage parlors, or clubs since it’s definitely considered illegal; however, the government turns a blind eye on it since it’s ‘very profitable’ due to the''sexpats''.''Besides, even if I’m curious about how it works or looks like, I wouldn’t dare venture into\xa0those establishments\xa0or streets during their ‘peak hours’ because:''I value my life, thank you very much''I have visions of pimps kidnapping me, and;''I also don’t want to be mistaken as one of the\xa0girls''However, Amsterdam’s RLD is somehow different''.''It has a tinge of seediness—''of course that feeling will always be there''—but for the most part, it felt or seemed so…''normal''. Nothing is ‘hidden’ either;\xa0they’re as vocal, straight-forward, and transparent as they could be to the public, probably due in part to how\xa0prostitution in the Netherlands\xa0is''legal'':\xa0establishments have clear huge neon lights directly advertising sex shows or peep shows, and of course there are the rows\xa0of tiny rooms with the scantily-clad\xa0girls, offering their services behind a glass door/window that’s illuminated in red.''This kind of red light district is''NOT''only found in Amsterdam. It’s a common thing in the whole of Europe; Antwerp for example has\xa0something similar to this and it was more ‘organized’ in a sense that the windows are in a flowing manner, whereas the ones here in Amsterdam are very scattered and you have to walk through small side streets etc.''“IT FELT NORMAL”'':\xa0I say this because it was such a ‘touristy’ place. You can even see families strolling around, eager to see the ‘oddity’ of this nightlife spot—and yes, there were even families\xa0with kids!\xa0Of course, you will also see the occasional man negotiating and talking to a ‘window girl’''(he gets in, a red curtain will be drawn over the window, \xa0once done, he gets out in a rush).''BUT the number of curious couples and groups were far more rampant, that the place becomes a mystifying thing on its own. Groups of girls during their ‘hen night’ or bachelorette party are common here too; most likely giggling around and daring one another to watch the sex shows.''There were even police people stationed at certain spots to ensure that public order is maintained. In fact, it can be said that the RLD here is one of the safest areas in Amsterdam because of the number of policemen and the bodyguards (pimps?) that the girls personally have.''I’m here to simply inform you how I saw and interpreted this RLD. And if you’re curious how prostitution is handled in this side of the world,\xa0then by all means, visit it yourself and quench your inquiring mind or continue reading this post.''I, for one, was peculiar\xa0about\xa0Amsterdam’s liberal\xa0and tolerant attitude about all of this,\xa0that’s why I wanted to see for myself how they embrace\xa0the fact that some people are\xa0just into prostitution, soft drugs (read my experience with this''here''), and pornography—''that it is all a\xa0‘human’ thing.''That rather than banning it (because it will always be there; people will always find a way) it’s better to regulate it in order to protect the women involved.''However, if you’re the kind of person who hates these kinds of things in the first place, then surely don’t go; you’ll definitely end up loathing it.''Also,\xa0if you’re a family, please don’t bring your kids; let them discover this place on their own when they are older. But I guess… okay, whatever floats your boat. Society is slowly becoming more open-minded than before and I could understand if some parents want to expose their kids to the realities of this world; but I do hope to goodness that you guys are\xa0mindful of what you’re doing.''“''IT IS LEGAL”'': Prostitution was legalized in Amsterdam last 2000 in an aim of regulating\xa0this business, protecting the women, and ensuring\xa0that organized crime, human trafficking, or money laundering are kept at bay.''With this, prostitution became some sort of ‘''legitimate business’''wherein all girls have to be registered in the government with a self-employed status (to also ensure that they are not younger than 21) and are positioned in the same tax bracket as that of a tour guide. So yes, they do pay taxes and they have to be officially licensed.''The girls also have the right to choose which\xa0customers to take in and if ever there’s trouble—money dispute or bad customer—they always have an alarm button in their area that would connect them to the police who are just minutes or seconds away (remember how I said that they’re scattered around the RLD?).''We can never know,\xa0despite all the efforts of the government to regulate this business,\xa0if there are girls who are still involved in human trafficking (there’s a high chance that there still are). But for the most part, this appears to be seasonal work for some girls who leave their European countries, looking for profitable\xa0work in\xa0a short period (like 6 months or more) so that they can return to their country with a\xa0small fortune.''Laws for prostitution vary across Europe but the 8 countries:''Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, Hungary,''and''Latvia''have made\xa0prostitution legal and regulated so that there won’t be room for exploitation on the prostitutes.''Some countries however, made prostitution wholly illegal, either criminally prosecuting the clients or the prostitutes themselves. Whereas\xa0countries like\xa0Spain, Belgium and the Czech Republic\xa0have\xa0prostitution as\xa0not officially and not legally regulated; they are simply tolerated or recognized\xa0as a job\xa0and\xa0laissez-faire.''»''Where is''De Wallen?''De Wallen''or''De Walletjes''is located in the oldest part of the city, covering several blocks to the south of the church''Oude Kerk''and a 10-minute walk away from the Amsterdam Central Station.\xa0(There are no tram stops nearby but the nearest station is''Nieuwmarkt'').''This RLD consists of a network of alleys containing approximately 300 tiny one-room cabins rented by prostitutes and that together with\xa0the other lesser-known prostitution areas''Singelgebied''and''Ruysdaelkade'', form the''Rosse Buurt''(red light areas) of Amsterdam.''The old canals''Oudezijds Voorburgwal''and''Oudezijds Achterburgwal''passes through this RLD as well, giving\xa0the place a distinct charm. But then again,\xa0without the sex shops, red windows and whatnot, this area already holds a sense of glamour\xa0as it is the most medieval part of the city—what with\xa0its old buildings and\xa014th century architecture. (It’s actually along these canals where you will find the main part of the RLD. It’s easy to spot because you’ll see all\xa0the establishments who hold\xa0sex shows.\xa0To see more ‘red windows’, you will have to go through the side streets and alley ways.)''»''What to remember when in''De Wallen?''Do''NOT''take photos of the occupied windows''– this is prohibited and any attempt to do so have consequences. Every girl will get mad and they will run after you, or worse, their bodyguards or ‘pimps’ will come out to get you. While strolling around, I personally witnessed a girl getting mad at a guy who took a photo of her; I didn’t know what happened next but it’s likely (like what other people’s stories go) that they will crush the\xa0camera or phone (or ensure that it’s deleted/gone). So it’s best that you respect the girls’ privacy.\xa0Though during my stay, I did manage to get a shot of… something else…''Let me tell you what’s happening right now.''Every 7 hours, a rhino is poached in''South Africa''. In 2014, there have been over 1,020 rhinos that were killed and yet only 344 arrests were made. Now this number is very alarming because 10 years ago, we only lost 4 rhinos.''At the rate that this is going, in 20 years, the rhinos will be totally extinct in the wild.''The hunt for wildlife in Africa is something that you probably already know of; but what you have to know is that it’s brutal and ferocious! On average, Africa loses 120 elephants, 5 lions, and 4 rhinos every day—these are numbers that are clearly frightening. To highlight a specific specie in particular, currently there are only 5,000 Black Rhinos left on the whole of the continent when in fact, 50 years ago they were at 500,000.''To sum this all up: it’s tragic and I hope that you won’t let their extinction happen in our lifetime.''In order to put a stop to this madness, there are over 120 travel bloggers (me included) and 20 eco-conscious brands that are joining hands to help support and make the''#JustOneRhino''campaign happen.''This is an initiative that is being led by''Travelers Building Change''and''Green Travel Media''as it aims to raise $45,000 in order to help relocate rhinos from the poacher-filled lands of South Africa to a remote location in Botswana\xa0so that they can protect them from poaching.''To help aid and donate to this cause, please click the button below:''DONATE NOW!''To learn more information about the campaign that\xa0you’re donating into, you can''skip to the bottom section of this post''. Otherwise, do continue reading below to learn more\xa0information about the rhinos and why they need to be translocated:''.''Why are the rhinos being poached?''Other than trophy hunting, the rhinos are continuously being poached because of\xa0rampant illegal trading of their horns (which currently\xa0sells for $65,000 per kilo or 2.2 pounds).''This demand is apparently being strongly driven by buyers from East Asia who believe that the horn will magically cure certain illnesses or ailments like cancer, fever, and the like—''which is not true since it’s much like chewing your own nail; it’s just keratin.''Certainly,\xa0if the demand is strong and the return is enormous, those in South Africa who are in poverty would not mind preservation and would willingly kill these animals to uplift their financial situation.''This poaching activity is not as simple as catching and releasing the rhinos though… Given the false belief\xa0that the highest level of medicinal potency\xa0is where the horns meet the face, what happens is that\xa0rather than just taking off the horn, poachers will often just take the whole face of the poor animal.''.''Would translocation to Botswana help?''YES''. South Africa holds 80% of today’s rhino population but given its liberal poaching laws and hindered conservation attempts (because of corruption), it has become the main target of poachers and trophy hunters.''But Botswana on the other hand has the strictest laws in all of Africa when it comes to poaching and it\xa0is regulated by the Botswana Defense\xa0Force. What’s special about this force is that they function\xa0with a\xa0policy of ‘shoot-to-kill’ on offenders, treating them as ‘aggressive military threats’. What’s more is that Botswana has the lowest poaching rate in all of Africa.''So clearly with all of these facts, it’s a better option to move rhinos from South Africa to Botswana so that their recovery and reproduction cannot be hindered.''.''Who is going to translocate the rhinos and how?''National Geographic Explorers-in-Residence: Dereck and Beverly Joubert who are currently in Botswana’s Okavango Delta. If you haven’t heard of this duo, then you should know that they\xa0are actually famous for their''National Geographic’s Big Cats Initiative''that\xa0now, they are planning on saving rhinos and spearheading a project\xa0called''Rhinos Without Borders''wherein they will translocate 100 white and black rhinos from South Africa to Botswana\xa0this year.''Translocating\xa0these rhinos\xa0is actually a very lengthy and expensive process. Other than Jouberts and their team, relocation experts from eBeyond will also help with this initiative wherein first, there will be a meticulous process of picking out the rhinos suitable for relocation.''They will do blood samples and\xa0other rigorous tests in\xa0order to affirm\xa0if a rhino is equipped to make the trip; if a rhino is suitable, they will quarantine it for 6 weeks. Afterwards, they will be air-lifted and distributed to a secret and remote location in Botswana—but, that doesn’t stop there.''The team would still continue to make health checks to ensure the rhinos’ well-being before setting them free.\xa0To help them establish their territory, synthesized rhino dung will also be used in order to\xa0aid them.''This whole process of moving 100 rhinos will involve a grand total of $4.5 million and Rhinos Without Borders is even hoping to raise it to $8 million to continue conservation efforts. Now the total cost for one rhino is $45,000 and this is the sum that #JustOneRhino and Travelers Building Change hopes to help raise for the Rhinos Without Borders campaign.''.''What exactly is #JustOneRhino\xa0campaign led by Travelers Building Change?''The main goal of the #JustOneRhino campaign is to\xa0help raise $45,000 to fund the translocation of 1 rhino (out of the 100) that the Rhinos Without Borders aims to accomplish.''Rhinos Without Borders'', that’s spearheaded by National Geographic duo: Dereck and Beverly Joubert, is raising $4.5 million of funds to secure the translocation of 100 white and black rhinos to a\xa0safer part of Africa which is Botswana in order to protect them from further poaching.''Whereas the''Travelers Building Change''(TBC) is made up of over 120 bloggers (me included) who are using their websites and social channels to raise awareness for this cause and help fund the translocation.

Surely it won’t be accomplished\xa0overnight but with a few changes in your lifestyle, it becomes very achievable in the long run.''For starters, track your spending habits:''where is most of your salary going to?''Is it from eating in expensive restaurants during lunch break? Is it from your bar hopping spree in the weekends as you\xa0drown\xa0your worries away? Is it because of your shopping sprees whenever you feel stressed from work? Go and quickly identify these unnecessary expenses and then cut them out.\xa0You’ll see for yourself that you can save a LOT of cash when you really separate your wants and needs, and then scratching out the unimportant\xa0expenses that you are making on your ‘wants list’.''Change your habits.''Live cheaper as you work towards your goal while making\xa0ways to save money in every chance that you get.''Go into a savings routine: for example, save a bit of cash every week. If we put it into numbers, let’s say you save Php 100 (roughly $2) every week of the year and then if you add that same amount weekly (in an incremental way), by the end of the year\xa0you have\xa0saved about Php 138,000 ($3,000+)!''Watch out for\xa0cheaper options: if you focus your travel goals\xa0first on\xa0cheaper countries, the whole plan itself\xa0becomes even more attainable. So keep a lookout for\xa0airline discounts too, or opportunities to get accommodation for free (like couchsurfing). Once you do these small but big steps, it becomes easier and easier as you prepare\xa0and save up for your travel fund.''In the end, don’t ever let yourself say that\xa0you can’t afford to travel because as you can see, you''really''can. You just have to be smart and in control about how you can work\xa0your way to make it happen.''»''READ'':''Money Saving Tips to Start & Live a Life of Trave''NOTE'': In lieu with this, for sure there’s the topic of ‘privilege’.
