Python Crawler for the web

This folder contains a suite of crawlers that I have used for my AI projects.

1) Travel blog crawler -  Scrapes several blogs of top travel bloggers
2) Seattle job market crawler - Scrapes Seattle companies and job market data from builtinseattle.com

The crawler has been written using BeautifulSoup. More details in the respective crawler folders.
