We have spent the last year transitioning much of our production infrastructure to run on top of kubernetes. We are looking for someone to come help us mature that new platform, and finish transitioning the long tail of legacy systems to the new one. We also need someone to help us reshape other portions of our underlying production infrastructure as we continue to rapidly grow and scale. Outreach has grown enormously each of the last several years; we don't see any signs of stopping soon. That means we need someone to help us identify the constraints in our system, and prioritize which ones we address.
