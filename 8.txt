'Saving up to travel the world is something that many people only dream of. Taking off with a nice cushion of cash to live the dream is awesome, no doubts about it, but what if there’s an alternative for those who don’t want to wait that long, or don’t have the means yet?''For many of us, we are privileged to have the choice to live life in a non-conventional manner. I mean,''making a career out of a travel blog'', for one, is something people from the previous generations could never imagine! While travel blogging is an amazing way to sustain a nomadic lifestyle, it is certainly not the only career option if you want to work and travel simultaneously. In today’s column, meet Liz, who volunteers and WWOOFs to not only learn and gain skills, but also to fulfill her passion for travel:''Tell us about yourself!''Liz on a beach in South Italy''I think I’ve always had an adventurous streak that came through pretty early, I could be quite a mischievous kid! I think the people who know me today would say that I’m easy-going, always down to have a chat or to be silly. I think I would like to be known as someone who was curious, always chased the inspiration and was good company. Someone who was fiercely independent, took care to learn and understand things, but also didn’t take life too seriously!''How did you decide to get into volunteering?''With a rabbit on a farm, doing exchange''I felt that something was missing from the long-term travels I had done in the past. I felt like I was just watching from the sidelines and not giving back. I was over hostels, the drinking culture and the exhaustion of staying somewhere for 1 day and then moving on so fast. I wanted a way to make travel a lifestyle and volunteering seemed like the perfect way to make that happen.''WWOOF''and''Workaway''are the main platforms I use to find volunteering opportunities on the road.''I decided to get into volunteering because it seemed to be the perfect compromise between the immersive nature of a working holiday, yet with the freedom of travelling. You decide where you want to go, and when to move on. Volunteering runs on the principle that you are free to go, but you choose to stay. It also allows me to stretch my budget much further, as I don’t have to worry about food and accommodation!''Tell us more about your experience volunteering on the road!''first ever solo trip to Nepal, at 19 yrs old.''I love to look for the quirky opportunities when trying to pick a project. It always adds something unique and unforgettable to my travels and my experience of a country. When you volunteer, you share the workday, a home, and meals with someone- you effectively get to live a different life temporarily. So why not choose the most dynamic and interesting experiences possible? From looking after goats in small mountain villages to living on a converted bus, I feel like I’ve experienced many different lifes in my limited lifespan.''I also try to pick volunteer projects that can teach me something interesting or useful. I picked a lot of permaculture and sustainable living projects at the beginning of my travels, as this is something I am interested in creating for myself in the future. These projects really helped me learn the ropes and see what these lifestyles entail, as well as allowing me to pick up useful techniques for self-sustainable living. You never know what type of help people might be looking for.''Volunteering overseas is also a great tool for learning languages! I find that hosts are normally extremely patient and helpful by allowing volunteers to practice the local language with them. It’s normally noted on host profiles what languages the host speaks. If they don’t speak your mother-tongue, it can be a great way to push yourself to practice and pick up language skills!''What are some of the other obstacles you’ve had to overcome in order to make travelling a lifestyle?''Liz with a mural she painted on a goat pen in Sicily''I think the biggest obstacle to overcome was the insecurities from the societal pressures that come with''following a life without a set plan''. I still meet people that subtly try and put me down when they hear how I’m spending my time because I’m not working towards a conventional career and I don’t know''where I will be in 5 years''(or even 5 weeks, haha). I think I overcame this firstly by honestly asking myself what I really wanted in my life. Naturally, I established that travel was a big part of what I truly wanted, and from there I set out to make travel both a wonderful experience and a learning process for me. When I travel, I try and set a goal to learn something specific, whether it’s a skill, a language- it doesn’t matter as long as it’s something I’m interested in. Knowledge is power, and I figure that even if I don’t know exactly how I will use what I’ve learned, it can be helpful in the future.''I love doing it, and it’s what I’d be doing anyway, but in this lifestyle, you definitely have to be resourceful and self-sufficient. The more you have to draw from, the more possibilities you create for yourself and you really never know when something can come in handy.''Also, if I ever find myself packing up travelling and starting a conventional career in a few years time, the interviewer will probably look at the huge employment gap on my CV and ask me what on earth have I been doing with myself the past X years. I hope I’ll be able to give them a good list!''How do you use travel as a way to learn and gain skills?''Gardening in Malta as a part of a volunteer exchange''Travel is one of the richest sources of education, you simply just need to know how to utilise the resources available. I am still exploring all the possibilities! For the last few months, I have started a project of immersive travel in''Italy''. The goals were to learn the Italian language, culture and history totally independently, without taking any formal classes. To do this, I travelled slow, used resources where I could immerse myself in the culture like Workaway and WWOOF. It was a sort of travel ‘experiment’ to see if I could find a self-sufficient mode of learning.''Websites for volunteering and cultural exchange like WWOOF and Workaway are great platforms because they put you into contact with so many different people with different skills and passions! You really can learn so much about culture, lifestyle, food and so many more things that you could never predict. Through my time using these platforms, I’ve been lucky enough to find people patient enough to practice Italian conversation with me. I started from zero knowledge, and have just used free or cheap mobile applications like''Duolingo''and''Babbel''to help me in addition.''Through volunteering, it’s also awesome to see how other people live self-sufficiently, there are lots of handy skills to pick up: self-built homes, growing your own food, setting up solar panels…I could go on. It’s awesome to learn about lifestyle alternatives, an one day I can use what I’ve learned to create something for myself when I finally want to settle down and have a nest to roost.''What are some of the considerations and experience you think others in your position should know before choosing a place to volunteer?''I luckily have never run into any problems volunteering. However, one piece of advice is to go with your gut. A host’s profile or the short email interactions you have with them may not seem like a lot to go off of, but I think that someone’s tone and expression say a lot. I try to look for hosts who are expressive and inviting in their approach, who view volunteering as a platform for mutual exchange and not just an avenue for free labour. It’s normally quite easy to tell. If something in the interaction makes you uncomfortable or ill at ease, just don’t go. Also remember that if you get there and are feeling uncomfortable in any way, you can leave at any time.''Checking past reviews are also a good tool when choosing a project if you are unsure of how to choose a project. Finally, always let someone back home know where you are and keep them informed of the address you are staying at. There is nothing to worry about as long as long as you just exercise general caution and awareness!''How did Be My Travel Muse help you?''Get the Guidebook for Solo Female Travelers!''I was reading Be My Travel Muse a long time ago before I ever travelled! I remember reading Kristin’s''budget post for South-East Asia'', and thinking ‘wow! it’s really possible to do that?’''I think BMTM helped me a lot because Kristin always kept things real, and didn’t paint travel as just a long-term ‘vacation’. The articles about the struggles and the''lower points on the road''still had a takeaway for those not travelling, and they really helped me go into long-term solo travel knowing what I could be in for. Asides from that, the awesome photos and''destination guides''kept on fuelling the fire of my wanderlust…''Pin me!''***''Thank you Liz, for sharing your story!

I had high hopes for the trip to go well, and I felt nothing but excitement before meeting the 15 people who joined my first ever group tour, but the group and the experience somehow exceeded my high hopes and expectations.''Me right now''Of course I wanted to hang out with some really cool people and have a fantastic time on my first-ever tour. More importantly, I wanted the people who put their faith, vacation time, in me to come on a trip that was well organized, enjoyable, and introduce them to a new level of adventure.''What I couldn’t have foreseen was just how incredible it would be to finally spend some meaningful time with the readers and subscribers of this blog. They are so smart (seriously, most of the people in the group have more degrees than I do!), Easy-going, non-cliquish, incredibly well-traveled, dynamic, varied, and adventurous. A couple of the girls on the trip just quit their jobs to travel, kicking it off with this trip, and one just finished up a year of solo traveling with a bang. Nobody was a diva and I laughed to the point of crying more times than I can count. It was like the group took on a life of its own and turned into the kind of adventure that you write a book about. We gelled so much that the goodbye was difficult at the end of the first week and especially at the end of spending two weeks with many of the girls and guys who came.''I was also overwhelmed by the response from the people who came. Some said it was the best adventure they’d been on and that in many ways it had been life-changing.''I’m not crying, you are!''Love these guys!''It started off brilliantly with a day trip around Cusco while everyone acclimated to the crazy altitude. Next we headed to the Moray ruins and the salt mines for some incredible photo ops.''So gorgeous!''The first major adventure was in the Sacred Valley when we climbed via ferrata up the side of a cliff and zip-lined back down. It was a challenge in a lot of ways, but everyone made it and the sense of accomplishment was amazing. It would kick off an incredible adventure to follow on the Inca trail.''The next four days took us along the trail of the ancient Incas to Machu Picchu. We had an amazing team of guides and porters leading us along the trail. We had some challenging things to contend with like the altitude and the Inca’s love for stairs, but we kept together as a group and had fun with it. We took turns wearing the community poncho, which I decided was highly necessary for photos by day two, and bonded over hot chocolate and popcorn in the evenings and playing games of would you rather and two truths and one lie. It’s amazing how well you get to know people by just doing silly things like that.''The community poncho making its first appearance''Stargazing in the evenings was amazing, and all of the gorgeous ruins and the challenge of the hike were worth the early wake ups. A highlight for me was sharing a birthday with two of the girls from week one, with a cake baked right on the trail and another one afterwards in Cusco, as well as climbing Huyana Picchu for a different point of view – The poncho tagged along of course!''The amazing stars at night''The first week ended with a hike to rainbow Mountain, the highest yet at over 16,000 feet. It was the cherry on top of a perfect trip and a packed itinerary. I knew that it had been ambitious to put all of that into only seven days, but I really wanted those two could only join us for a week to get the full Cusco experience, and they did!''With part of my group near the top''Next we bid goodbye to some of the group and flew to lima to welcome the new members who would join us for the second week in the Amazon. We got ready to head out from Lima, but not before paying a visit to the sea lions on the coast.''The four days that followed in the Amazon included flying into the middle of the jungle, boating further into the jungle for another two hours, hanging out in a screened in stilted hotel in research station over the water that is completely solar-powered and off the grid, and yet still had gourmet meals with fresh veggies every day.''I spent my birthday there,\xa0seeing nine sloths and pink river dolphins, and zip lining in the forest canopy with a group of amazing people who I had really come to bond with. By the end of it I wasn’t ready for it to be over. It had been such a wonderful experience with incredible people.''One of our sloth friends''I had been warned that leading tour groups could be stressful, and that it was almost guaranteed that some people in the group would become difficult or problematic. That honestly didn’t happen on my trip at all. I enjoyed every moment, so grateful that I finally had a chance to take readers on an adventure, the first one I had ever done.''This goofball helped a lot!''It also helps tremendously that I had an amazing tour leader and adventure partner along with us in Pete. I’m convinced he’s probably one of the most laid-back people I know, which makes leading a trip that much easier, plus, everyone’s sense of humor had us laughing and giggling constantly. You really can’t ask for a better group dynamic than that!''On the last evening in Huacachina''At the end of this I can’t wait to do more trips. We’ve already got three in the works for 2019, along with''Alaska in July''and Africa in October of this year.

Would it still be amazing if I wasn’t a backpacker anymore? Would I still connect with it? Is the saying, ‘''you can’t go back''‘, really true?''I figured it was time to update you guys but how it was traveling in Southeast Asia again in my early 30s.''In a nutshell, it was pure magic.''It was even''more''magical than the''first time I went in 2012''. I didn’t think that was possible, but that’s the beauty of traveling.''It was also almost entirely different to what I did and experienced the first time around. Here are the big things that changed around the who, what, where, why, and how:''Who I hung out with''Fewer connections with more meaning''Backpacking through Southeast Asia in my 20s meant that I was almost always surrounded by other backpackers who were also on a long-term journey and embracing their newfound freedom. At the time it was perfect for me. I’d been so worried before I went that the trip would be lonely and was delighted to find that''meeting people was easy''.''I worried I would feel out of place this time. I’m not a backpacker anymore, and I’m not in my 20s anymore.''That’s not to say I’m old AF now or anything, 31 is still plenty young, but since I hung out with people under 30 last time I worried that’s all I would find. I now realize that’s because I was hanging out in dorms before so that became my reality.''I’m happy to say I found people of all ages to hang out with this time, and the number of years we’ve been on this planet didn’t matter all that much.''I also found that I met a lot more locals on this trip. Part of that was going to''places in Thailand''that didn’t have as many foreigners around, heading to the''Philippines''where locals are friendly and easy to meet, and hanging out in places other than dorms and backpacker hangouts. It just put me in situations where I was more likely to meet locals and expats.''Where I slept''Not a bad place to hang your hat for a few days''One of the biggest differences between traveling in Southeast Asia in my 30s versus my 20s was my accommodation preferences. Previously, I was fixated on what I was spending and how I could make it even cheaper.''That meant sleeping in a lot of dorms. That’s all I did for almost 2 years!''While I absolutely love and cherish those years, they are over. So over.''I didn’t sleep in any dorms this time, opting for nicer accommodation and paying up a bit more for it. With a more grown-up budget, It was OK! I’ve also become more sophisticated with travel hacking and was able to use points quite often to pay for rooms. That’s another post in itself, but it made a more comfortable trip possible.''What I spent''Breakfast splurges: Worth it''My''budget in Southeast Asia''in 2012 and 2013 was about $1000 per month once I was on the ground. I spent more than that this time, particularly in Thailand where I rented a car, and on my flight to Raja Ampat in West Papua, Indonesia, which set me back over $300. That said, I didn’t spend anything on my business class flight from Berlin over to Chiang Mai thanks to travel hacking, and as I mentioned in the previous section, often kept my costs low for accommodation as well even though I stayed in nicer places. I spent more in Thailand but less in the Philippines and Indonesia. Overall I only increased my budget by about 50%.''I still ate cheap street food and still took local buses whenever possible. I think the value is better and like the experience more in both cases.''I splurged on nice coffee though, and did so often. I also spent a bit more to go to nicer spas for massages, and it was worth it. I didn’t skimp on any activities because of the price, but that’s actually true of my previous journey as well. I always prioritized experiences.''It was a huge help that''I didn’t spend anything on alcohol''this time as well. Partying can kill one’s budget quickly.''How I experienced it''So much more enriching''My experience traveling in Southeast Asia in my 30s was wildly different than in my 20s. I was into partying a lot more back then. I was so happy to be free. It was heaven.''However I remember feeling like I was saying hello and goodbye several times a day living the hostel and backpacker life. It sometimes felt like''Groundhog Day'', having the same conversations\xa0over and over: ‘Where are you from, how long are you traveling for?’''It often lacked substance.''This time, I had to work harder at meeting people since I didn’t stay in social accommodation, but that ended up making each connection even more valuable and special.''I was more likely to make connections by striking up a conversation in a café, which is certainly harder than in a hostel or a bar. It just takes more courage. I also met people at retreats (I did two on this trip – Vipassana in Thailand and a women’s retreat in Bali), or on excursions like the''diving trip in Raja Ampat''or day trips in the Philippines.''It felt like each friendship was a lot more conscious, with deeper conversation topics and more meaningful moments shared between us.''Why it was so amazing this time''Incredible Raja Ampat – taken by Dayna, a friend I made on the trip''Sometimes I wondered, is this the''Truman Show''right now? How did this perfect person walk into my life at the perfect time?''Maybe this will sound a bit woo-woo (but I am a bit woo-woo, you’ve probably noticed by now), but it just felt like people kept coming into my experience who were meant to be there. It could just be a coincidence once, sure, but not over and over.''There were local people in the Philippines who completely''changed my mind about it''. There was another 30-something woman I hung out with Siargao who I really bonded with, and the''same happened in Kuta''. The retreats that I did were totally core and life-changing and both fostered beautiful connections.''I felt like I was more awake this time, and more present to the journey unfolding in front of me. I don’t know if that comes from being older and wiser or maybe just not being hungover. Life felt like it was in high-definition – still does.''So you can go back, it turns out. It’s okay if the place changed, and especially if you changed.''That’s why we travel in the first place – to be changed – isn’t it?''Pin me!''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Hello from the Amazon jungle in Peru on my 32nd birthday. This is a pretty important moment, because at this point I will be about to wrap up my first ever adventure tour, a big step forward in life and this brand. 20-year-old me never imagined that this moment would come, mostly because in her wildest fantasies, this wasn’t even an option.''She had a lot of questions, with no idea about the possible answers.''And I think for a lot of us, that’s why we travel, why we try new things, and why we search out belief systems. We want to know why.''Why am I here? What is the point? How can I make this better? How can I make it matter?''I spent most of my 20s searching for answers. In my 30s, I’ve become a lot more comfortable with accepting that I just don’t know. I’m not supposed to know everything. It would ruin the surprise, and the things we least expect are often what makes this ride called life so beautiful.''But I''have''learned at least a thing or two. I do at least have''some''answers to the questions that I used to have before. These are the answers to 20 of my biggest questions in my 20s, and what I would say if my past self were sitting in front of me:''1. How much do the things I do now affect my future?''You aren’t even going to remember what the most important thing to you was 10 years ago today. Seriously it won’t even register.''It’s actually the tiny, seemingly insignificant things that cause a ripple that turns into a tsunami. It’s those chance interactions, the decision to turn left instead of right, and picking one café over the other, that will change your life forever. They will lead you to people who turn your world upside down. Some of it will be good, and some of it will lead to pain and the pain will lead to growth.''We don’t know where it all leads to''2. Do I matter?''You are the center of your own life and everything that you experience, and so is everyone else. Everyone tends to feel like what happens to them''is''life. However we all experience it differently.''There’s a vast and endless universe out there (as far as we know), and it has existed long before and will continue to exist long after you. You’re like a grain of sand, if even that, in the fabric of existence.''So take a chance, take a huge leap of faith. As long as you don’t make anyone else’s life worse with your actions, don’t worry about making a mistake big enough to matter, because it’s not a big deal. How freeing!''3. Will I find my ‘person’ by the time I’m 32?''Absolutely. Your person is you.''I know, I know, that’s not what you mean at all with this question. You want to know if you’ll find your soul mate. There will be times in your''20s where it feels like that’s all that’s missing''. You’ve met plenty of soul mates, because many souls will come into and float back out of your life over the course of the next decade and for as long as you live.''They will be shepherds, teachers, and in some cases lovers, but the person who will never leave you and will guide you through your entire life is you. Nobody else can fill that role, and expecting anyone else to will not leave enough room for them to be who they are meant, to you and to themselves.''It’s you!''4. How can I get people to love me?''By loving yourself first. Then they’ll be so inspired to love you too that you won’t even have to try.''On the flipside, it’ll never happen by''comparing yourself to others''. Either you’ll come up short, or you’ll have to reduce them to something lesser than you are so that you can ‘win’.''You can’t compare your inside to someone else’s outside. It’s not real.''5. What is real?''Nothing, actually. It’s just a ride called perception.''6. How will I know who to trust?''You will spend your 20s putting people to the test. You will always be looking to see if they are going to hurt you or cheat you in some way. What you won’t realize until much later is that this will inevitably lead to catastrophe. People are a mirror of you, and if you don’t trust them, then they won’t be trustworthy.''So trust everyone a little bit. Trust the guy who is serving you coffee to have made it with love, trust the person who is driving you to the airport to get you there safely, trust the person you fall in love with not to break your heart. If you get proven wrong, it’s a learning experience, but leave room to be proven right.''Taken a few days before my 31st birthday''7. What if people treat me poorly?''Some will, but it will be about their own pain more than it will be personal.''Whatever happens, don’t become a victim. Don’t get so hurt that you stop trusting good people or presume that everyone is out to hurt you. Then everyone loses.''8. What if I treat others poorly?''Yeah, that’ll happen. Everyone makes mistakes. The best thing you can do is own up to it, and commit to being different in the future, not just to that person but to everyone.''9. Is it okay to have cookies, and nothing but cookies, for dinner sometimes?''Oh yes, some things are just good for the soul.''Enjoy the journey''10. What if I fail?''Failure is a tricky word, because each experiment becomes a learning experience. The darkest moments of your life will lead you to the brightest ones. At many points over the next decade, you’ll look back and finally understand why''what happened''had to happen.''So make a mistake, because there’s actually no such thing.''11. How will I know where to go? How will I choose the right path?''Every path is open because there is no right or wrong path. The only path is the path that you are on.''12. How can I get a perfect body?''This answer will frustrate the hell out of you, but listening to your body will change everything. Right now you have no idea what that means, but it’s not just about going to the gym to pump iron, it’s about being fully present for the experience, doing it to''nourish yourself''because you love it. It’s amazing how much more effective each movement is when it’s conscious.''In a nutshell,''start hiking'', spend more time in nature, start pole dancing, get lots of sleep, stop drinking beer.''And accept your soul’s vessel as perfect the way it is. It’s the only one of its kind, so how could it not be perfect already?''You’re already perfect!''13. How can I avoid heartbreak?''We’ve done much experimentation and decided that trying to avoid heartbreak only causes it.''It’s better to love openly, treat each new person like they deserve all the trust in the world, and then treat it like a learning experience every time. Each relationship serves its unique purpose, for you and for the other person, and that’s a beautiful thing.''14. How can I be happier?''By deciding to be.''15. How can I become rich?''By''quitting your high-paying job'',''selling what you own'', sleeping on sandy and''slightly damp mattresses''with holey mosquito nets, by making peace with the mosquito bites so that you can enjoy those sunset moments, by almost going broke and''hitchhiking to keep the journey alive'', by working 16-hour days on a job that doesn’t pay you for two years, by making gifts that have nothing to do with what you will gain, but have everything to do''with the gift itself''.''By telling fear, ‘no’, and telling love, ‘yes’.''16. How can I get over let-downs?''By trusting in the journey.''By knowing that let-downs are catalysts for great change.''It all makes sense eventually''17. How can I be good enough?''This is still hard. Right now you’re grappling with the fact that you put years of work into building up Facebook and Instagram profiles only for the algorithm to stop showing them to people. It’s heartbreaking. It makes you question what it’s all for.''But you can’t get your sense of self from likes. It’s not and never was real life. Real life happens when you walk outside and the crisp fall air bites your nose in Berlin, or you see a flying fish jump out of the water in Indonesia, or you see the dolphins playing in the waves in California. When you stop comparing yourself to others and take the front seat of the show that is your own life, it’ll start appearing in high-definition.''18. How can I deal with naysayers?''You’re going to have a lot of them in life, more than you know or are prepared for right now. You’ll be dragged on forums, people will''comment on your body''online, and don’t even get me started on how scary people can be in''YouTube comments''!''But trolls and naysayers are two different things.''Trolls just need to vent. Be glad to give them the space in which to do that.''Naysayers are usually just scared''.\xa0We owe it to our naysayers to go out and do the thing they tell us we cannot do. To inspire them, to show them that anything is possible.''19. How can I deal with stress and difficult emotions?''By giving them space, accepting that they are there, knowing that they will pass, and not identifying with the thoughts. This is really oversimplifying a process it took you a full decade to learn and still takes a lot of practice, but you learned most of it through''reading these books'',''meditating'', doing practices that helped you become more reflective, and opening your mind and heart.''20. So what is the answer after all?''That life is really about the questions. I keep finding that each question just raises another question. I never really find any definitive answers.''And we are finally okay with that.''I love you 20-something Kristin! Great things are to come.''Did you like this post?

Before you stuff one into your bag, though, consider where and when you’re visiting Thailand. I learned the hard way while at a retreat near Chiang Rai in January, in the mountains in the far north of Thailand, that the weather can actually be quite cold at the higher elevations in the winter months! However if you’re just sticking to the south, like Bangkok and the islands, leave the fleece at home.''The rain jacket, on the other hand, is useful no matter where you go in the country. Rainy season in Thailand lasts from June until October but that doesn’t mean it’s the only time it rains. It’s a tropical jungle, so if you want to stay dry, bring a rain jacket! Just make sure it’s breathable and light, because it’ll be hot, too!''In the north I was happy to have pants and a scarf! Taken at''Wat Chaloem''Toiletries and other essentials''I usually just bring enough shampoo and conditioner to fill a 100-ml/3 oz bottle and refill on the road. You’ll find 7-11s everywhere and almost all of them sell Pantene and Dove. You’ll also find Nivea, so you can refill lotions and buy deodorant as well – just double check that it’s not the kind meant to whiten your skin, which is unfortunately quite popular in Thailand.''I say unfortunately because their skin is beautiful just the way it is, and so is yours!''However I do usually bring my own face wash and facial moisturizer with SPF – two things I’m very particular about. I also advise you bring enough razors with you since Venus isn’t something I saw much over there, and the same goes for menstrual cups, though tampons are somewhat easy to find.''I also consider certain electronics to be essential as a digital nomad, though I realize not everyone is in the same boat. If you’re curious, here’s a''listing of my camera gear''and my''favorite electronics bags''.''Cover knees and shoulders in temples. Taken at the Silver Temple in Chiang Mai,''featured here''.''Modesty''In general, Thais tend to dress a bit more on the conservative side. While it’s fine to wear tank tops and shorts, consider leaving the crop tops and booty shorts at home.''The only time when it’s required and essential to cover up is in temples, when shoulders and knees must be fully covered in order to enter. This is the motivation behind adding cute maxi dresses to the list, along with buying lightweight pants in Thailand – you can be covered up without overheating.''Travel Insurance''I highly recommend traveling with insurance.

It certainly felt like it while the moon shone over the water the night prior, nearly full, while the tree gently rocked to me to sleep.''Was it the best place I stayed in Indonesia, or Nusa Penida? Far from it. Was it one of the most unique experiences I had on the trip? Undeniably, yes, it was.''Read on for my full review of Rumah Pohon and how to enjoy it fully if you opt for the same experience:''The Rumah Pohon Treehouse''Just as dreamy as it looks!''This must be the best sunrise view on all of the Nusa Islands. The treehouse is nothing short of dreamy, at least from the outside.''There are three treehouses and they book out quite far in advance. I found it online in January and booked it knowing that I’d most likely be in the Nusa Islands in March – that’s how early I had to stake my claim. In high season in July I imagine it’s even more important to book ahead of time.''It’s also important to book the one you actually want. When I showed up, they let me pick which of the two open treehouses I wanted. Of course I picked the one with the best view, #1, pictured above. There are two others on the same peninsula that are both newer and probably a bit nicer inside, though they’re all basic and what you’re paying for is the view and the experience.''You can''book treehouse #1 on Airbnb here'', or''here for #2'', and''here for #3.''You can also''get $25 off through this link''.''You can also book it via''booking.com''and get''$30 off through this link''.''Is it worth it?''It’s real. I know, hard to believe!''It’s overpriced for sure. There’s a lumpy double bed, a fan, a narrow bench on the balcony that’ll make your bum go numb after 20 minutes, and not much else. The bathroom isn’t very clean, it’s not a private, secluded experience, and every move I made caused the tree and the bungalow to sway back and forth.''When I compare it with the AirBnB I stayed in earlier in the week on the top of the island which could have slept six people, had two bathrooms, was incredibly private, had an epic view of Mt. Agung, and gorgeous gardens for only a few dollars more per night, the value just isn’t there for the treehouse (you can read more about the other place and get my full''Nusa Penida itinerary here'').''I know this is to be expected, but since it’s so popular, people were asking constantly if they could come and take photos on the steps. I didn’t mind and I always said yes, until it was 5:45 AM and someone bounded up the steps shining a flashlight in the door. It scared the crap out of me!''That said, it was private at night, watching the moonlight over the bay. I also had access to it at sunrise which you can really only count on if you rent it. Otherwise, you can expect that the other people who rented it will be using it for their sunrise photo shoot.''How to Prepare''It’s a bit of a hike to get down to the treehouse, but don’t worry about carrying your stuff down the steps, the host will do it for you.''There’s nothing on the peninsula except for the three treehouses and a bathroom, so you’ll need to bring your own food and water down with you. There’s a warung with fried noodles, soup, and fried rice at the top where you can buy some food to take down, though you’ll want to eat it quickly or seal it in a Tupperware or jar as you’re sharing your space with ants and other critters too, potentially.''Getting There''As seen from my drone (his name is Herman)''The best way to get to the treehouse, and around Nusa Penida in general, is by motorbike. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours from the port area to get to the Rumah Pohon area as it’s on the opposite side of the island, though the drive is beautiful.''The roads are steep and pretty rocky and broken in places, so if you’re inexperienced or nervous on a motorbike, you can ask Artem, the owner, to organize transport for you.''The Rumah Pohon Treehouse was an adventure to say the least. Would I stay there again knowing what I know now? The photographer in me says yes, mostly for the opportunity to photograph it at sunrise.''If that doesn’t matter much to you and you want to climb down just to see it and take some photos, that’s entirely possible too. Of course, it’s up to whoever is staying at the treehouse at the time if they’ll let you walk up the steps to take photos or not.''I don’t feel like it’s a great value, and it’s probably only worth staying there for just one night (I actually booked two and only stayed for one), but with the following discounts you can save a bit on your stay (they also provide me a small commission at no extra cost whatsoever to you):''You can''book treehouse #1 on Airbnb here'', or''here for #2'', and''here for #3.''You can also''get $25 off through this link''.''You can also book it via''booking.com''and get''$30 off through this link''.''Happy adventuring on Nusa Penida!''Pin me!''READ NEXT: The Perfect Nusa Islands Itinerary''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''The Perfect Nusa Islands Itinerary''Nusa Penida’s Secret Spots''Nusa Ceningan: Everything You Need to Know''When the sun rose over the volcano caldera, lighting up the sky in shades of orange, pink, and yellow, it illuminated the electric blue lake and the blue flames of the volcano faded into the light.

That moment would feature on the highlight reel of my life.''This wasn’t the first time an experience in Indonesia would make that reel. There were the Manta rays in the water, the Orangutans swinging through the trees and the friendly people who all made me realize, there’s something magnetic about Indonesia. It’s so much more than just Bali.''The first time I visited Indonesia I budgeted six weeks thinking that would surely be enough to see all of the things that I wanted to see. I quickly came to realize that Indonesia is huge and that each island has its own unique food, culture, language, and often its own religion as well. Therefore each island is a destination in itself where one could spend months or years.''I say this not to discourage, but rather to help create some realistic expectations for your Indonesia itinerary. There are literally thousands of islands in the world’s fourth most populated country spanning close to 2 million square kilometers (over 735k square miles).''With that in mind here are some itinerary suggestions for 2 weeks to 2 months in Indonesia:''2 Weeks in Indonesia:''If you only have two or fewer weeks, I strongly suggest picking one or two regions and doing them justice, like only Lombok and Bali, or only Flores and Raja Ampat. Each are so special in their own way and in such a big country, it could otherwise feel like all you’re doing is rushing and moving around. Here’s a great option:''Days 1-4: Sumatra''An Orangutan in Sumatra''Fly into Medan and take a bus bound for Bukit Lawang. This will take most of the afternoon. Avoid Medan, really, there’s nothing to see there.''Book a day trek into the jungle to see the Orangutans. These are best organized with guides who grew up in the jungle and know how to track the Orangutans without offering them food.''More on how to do that here.''Spend a day in Bukit Lawang before or after and inner tube down the river, enjoying the company of the incredibly friendly locals.''Bus back to Medan and fly out to Bali.''Days 5-10: Bali & Nusa Islands''The Blue Lagoon on Nusa Ceningan''While most visitors to Indonesia flock to Bali, I tend to avoid it since the traffic can be hectic and many of the areas are Westernized, which I like to avoid when I travel. That said, Ubud and Canggu are traveler favorites and''Keramas''is a personal favorite of mine, and since Bali is so easy to fly into, consider spending a couple of days in one or the other before moving onto the Nusa Islands.''Take a ferry from Sanur to''Nusa Lembongan''or''Penida''and spend 3 days exploring these lovely islands – visit gorgeous beaches, snorkel with Manta rays, learn to surf, or chill at one of the many beachfront pools and cafes. From Lembongan, it’s easy to ride a motorbike over the bridge to Ceningan for a day trip, or consider staying on Ceningan for a more laid-back vibe. This is popular with surfers as well and boasts much smaller crowds than Bali.''Click here''for the perfect Nusa Islands itinerary.''Days 11-14: Lombok''Mt. Rinjani: So unique and impressive''Just a 2-hour fast boat over from the Nusa islands, or a short flight over from Bali, Lombok is yet again wildly different from the other islands you would have experienced with this itinerary, and well worth experiencing. Lombok is much quieter, more rural, and rugged.''You’ll have to make some choices here between the Gili islands just off the coast, trekking the Rinjani volcano, which usually takes 3 days and 2 nights, or heading down south to''Kuta for some gorgeous beaches''and surfing. There are also incredible waterfalls all over Lombok to check out. The adventure there can be endless.''This guide''can help you pick and choose which activities on the island call to you the most.''This waterfall on Lombok is unbelievable in person!''That’s one of many possible adventures for 2 weeks in Indonesia, though if you keep reading, you can pick and choose more options below.''1 month in Indonesia''You’ve got a full month in Indonesia – fantastic! You can take a bit more time in each place and rush around a little bit less. I also highly suggest adding diving into your itinerary, as Indonesia has some of the best in the world, truly!''Repeat the 2-week itinerary, but give yourself more time in each place and expand it to 21 days, spending extra time in Sumatra and adding in Pulau Weh for a quiet, secluded island or Lake Tobah to stay on an island within a lake within an island (say that ten times fast), or spending more time on Lombok so that you can enjoy the beaches, do the Rinjani trek, see the waterfalls,''and''spend some time on the''Gili islands''.''Gili Trawangan''From there, this itinerary can go one of two ways – the diving route or the volcano route. If you’re into diving:''Days 22-30: East Java''The sunrise at Kawah Ijen in Java, Indonesia''If you go this route, reverse Lombok and Bali and fly into Lombok from Medan, Sumatra. Spend time enjoying Lombok, then fly or boat to Bali and after a few days there, head to the Ubung bus terminal and buy an onward ticket to Bondowoso, ferry included. Traveling to the base of Kawah Ijen will take most of the day.''Once on Java, we’ll head to Kawah Ijen, the experience I referenced in the opening of this post, which still ranks at the top of my list over five years of travels and adventures later.\xa0Kawah Ijen is famous for its blue flames and the amazingly strong sulfur miners who carry loads up and down the volcano all day and night.

This temple was built in the 9th century and represents a mix of Buddhism and ancestor worship. It’s a unique temple in Java that you won’t see a match for in the rest of Southeast Asia. From there, fly out of Yogyakarta home or to your next destination.''OR''Days 22-30: Komodo''Gorgeous Komodo National Park''It’s hard to beat Indonesia when it comes to diving and though there are many places with fantastic dive spots, Komodo and Raja Ampat reign supreme.''Komodo is a bit cheaper and easier to get to, flying into Flores and hopping onto a dive boat from there. The corals are fantastic, Manta rays are regularly sighted, and the scenery is gorgeous as well. Plus, you get to see the famous Komodo dragon on Rinca, the island pictured above.''For more on diving Komodo, read here.''Komodo’s main season is April through December, though you can dive there year round. If you’re in Indonesia during the rainy season, consider spending a bit less time in Bali, or cutting out Sumatra, and spending 11 days to two weeks in Raja Ampat, flying into Sorong, West Papua. While it’s possible to get on a dive boat in Komodo for just three or six days, most dive trips in Raja Ampat are longer, and it does tend to be more expensive. That said, the abundance and diversity of fish is mind-blowing, and the corals are varied, plentiful, and vibrant. Plus, the islands are incredible too. It’s easily one of the best trips I’ve ever been on.''Read more on diving in Raja Ampat here.''Incredible Raja Ampat''Note that both Komodo and Raja Ampat have notoriously strong currents and are better suited to divers with some experience. You should have at least your advanced open water before getting on a dive boat in either place. Nitrox is advised.''2 Months in Indonesia''With two months in Indonesia you can take a bit more time in each place, planning ahead much less and opting to spend extra days or even a week here and there in the places that call to you the most.''For this itinerary I suggest allowing for more fluidity, with a few key things planned out in advance such as flights and diving.''Week one: Sumatra''Spend more time in the jungles, on Lake Tobah, or on Pulau Weh. To truly head off the beaten path, head south on this giant island and explore the jungles.''Weeks two through four: Bali, the Nusa Islands, and Lombok''An amazing sunset on Lombok''Given how much there is to do on and around Lombok and Bali, slow down, take a bit more time to explore, and take yoga classes, go for hikes on the volcanoes, learn to surf, attend a retreat, or just park in a bamboo bungalow for a week and hang at the beach.''It’s easy to slow down and spend a good chunk of time in this area. My particular favorites are the mainland of Lombok, particularly''Kuta’s beaches'', and the''Nusa islands''.''Week five: Sumbawa or East Java''Sumbawa, the next hidden paradise''Explore the volcanoes and temples of East Java, or go the other direction and check out Sumbawa, a truly off the beaten path gem that’s perfect for beach bums and especially surfers.''For a wave that has almost nobody else on it, a beach with only a few huts, and the type of tourist who tends to stay for 2-3 months on just this beach, look no further than Sumbawa. This is the next hidden paradise that almost nobody knows about. This is the spot that is only starting to get on the radar of surfers in the know. To get there, the easiest method is a boat with''Ozone Adventure''from Kuta Lombok.''Weeks six through eight: Diving in Raja Ampat or Komodo''Does it get any more beautiful than this?? Raja Ampat''If you’re a diver, then you absolutely must experience Komodo, Raja Ampat, or both. These are easily the best spots for diving in Indonesia and each has the small stuff, the big stuff, and incredible corals. Scroll up to the one-month itinerary for more information on how to get to each and who to book dives with.''With that, you will have had an incredible trip in Indonesia, both in the popular places and in plenty of off the beaten path spots as well. It’s the perfect mix in a country that delivers high value for your money and has great food and friendly people to boot.''Keep in mind this itinerary still only covers a small part of a huge country. There’s also Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Sumba, West Java, East Timor, and so many more!

Located just 30 minutes by boat from Bali’s Sanur, this is what people say Bali was like 30 years ago.''There are three Nusa islands: Lembongan, Ceningan, and Penida. Nusa Lembongan is the closest to Bali and the most popular, followed by the smallest; Ceningan, and then the biggest and least popular; Penida.''Most people just pop over to the Nusa islands for a day or two, and only visit Penida as a day trip. I hope this guide convinces you to reverse that, spending more time on Penida and exploring this beautiful, mystical island, the only one of the three that truly does feel like a quieter Bali.''This trip can be done in four days, though you can easily expand it to cover a week or several weeks.''How can this be real?! The Blue Lagoon on Ceningan''This is the ideal Nusa Islands itinerary:''Getting There''Nusa Lembongan is the starting point for your Nusa islands trip. You can either get there from Bali or Lombok. There is just one fast boat company operating out of Lombok’s Senggigi, Scoot, though there are more options from the''Gili islands''in which case the price is more negotiable.''If coming from Bali’s Sanur, You have the following options:''A local slow boat: This one leaves Sanur starting at around 8am (though public boats in Indonesia tend to just leave when full) and costs 60,000-100,000 Rupiah. The journey takes about an hour to 90 minutes and is the least comfortable and safe option.''Perama local boat: Leaves Sanur at 10:30 and costs 150k Rupiah and also takes 90 minutes to an hour though on a slightly larger and more comfortable boat.''Fast boats: A fast boat with four daily departures which includes pickup at your accommodation, a safer and faster boat, and a quicker journey of about 30 minutes. The cost is much higher, however, at 250k-300k Rupiah. The main options are either''Scoot''or''Rocky Fast Cruise''. I went with Rocky, simply showing up at the port 30 minutes before departure and buying a ticket in person, and was satisfied with the experience. On the way back, I used Scoot and can recommend them as well.''If you’re low on time, I suggest taking a fast boat and factoring it into the budget in order to maximize your island time.''Day one: Nusa Lembongan and Ceningan''Since both Lembongan and Ceningan are so small, it’s pretty easy to drive around each one and power through most of the sights in just a day. For ease, it might make the most sense to just stay on Lembongan, rent a motorbike immediately from the port or your accommodation, and ride around to see the following:''The Mangroves''Snorkel and cruise the mangroves''Driving to the top of the island, you’ll eventually come to the end of the road where you’ll see signs for mangrove tours. I was offered one for 100k which includes about an hour of boating through the mangroves and some snorkeling. I’d been through some mangroves in''Raja Ampat''prior so I took a pass and droned over it instead, but don’t be lazy like me, see the mangroves!''Next I took a drive over the yellow bridge to Ceningan to avoid the day tourists on Lembongan and save the more spectacular sights there for when the crowds were thinner.''The Sand''Yes, please''Upon crossing the bridge and turning right, you’ll notice gorgeous, crystal clear water and several beach bars along the shore. This quirky bar, the Sand, is great for lunch or a drink – complete with paper straws instead of plastic (yay!) and these hammocks over the water.''The Blue Lagoon''The Blue Lagoon on Nusa Ceningan''About a 10-minute drive, if that, from the Sand, you’ll see signs for the Blue Lagoon on your left. The water at this lagoon is a shade of baby blue I’d never seen before, despite years of exploring the tropics. It’s hard to believe until you see it with your own eyes!''Mahana Point Cliff Jump''Not a bad surf spot!''Just across the way from the Blue Lagoon you’ll see signs for the Mahana Point restaurant and cliff jump. The restaurant has two jumps: a shorter one for 25k or a higher one for 50k. It’s also the access point for one of the best surf spots on the island and gorgeous views of Bali’s Mt. Agung.''Golden hour at Dream Beach''Dream beach at 4:30, much nicer!''Next, drive back over the bridge to explore more of Lembongan, turning left at the end of the bridge towards Dream Beach. Dream Beach is one of Lembongan’s most famous attractions which is why we’ve left it for later in the day when there are fewer people around. After seeing the beauty of Cengingan it was harder to appreciate dream beach to be honest, but it’s still worth seeing and hanging out if you want a chance to lay on the sand.''Sunset at Devil’s Tear and tide pools''Dreamy''The Devil’s tear got its name thanks to the spray when the waves crash up against the cliffs. It’s only dazzling at golden hour if it’s high tide, though the tide pools to the right of it are perfect for sunset no-matter what the tide.''Just be careful around the cliff edges here. The waves are unpredictable and can splash up at any time.''Sleep:''I thought the value, coffee, and hospitality at''Kawan’s Inn''was fantastic. They rent scooters as well!''These are just a few of my suggestions for these two islands. If you have more time to devote to them, read more about''Nusa Lembongan here''and more about''Nusa Ceningan here''.''Days two through three: Nusa Penida''Take an early AM yoga class at Yoga Shack on Lembongan, then pack up and get ready to head to Nusa Penida.''Day two will involve some time just getting to Nusa Penida, which you can do either by taking a public ferry from the yellow bridge, which leaves when full and costs about 50,000 IDR per person, or by heading to the mangroves to organize a private boat for 400,000 IDR. The latter is nice because it’s easier to get dropped off at an area of your choice and you don’t have to wait around for the boat to fill up.''Once on Penida, hire a motorbike for around 70,000 IDR per day.''The roads on Nusa Penida can be tricky in some places. They are steep and rocky and if you’ve never driven a motorbike before you might find them a bit terrifying. It’s also possible to hire a driver and a car – just ask at your guesthouse or at the port. While exploring the island, it’s a good idea to wear sneakers instead of flip flops. Nusa Penida is a lot more rugged and less developed (thankfully!) and has a lot more cliff edges and steep stairways. It’s all part of the adventure!''Pick your favorites of the following amazing places over the next couple of days:''Kelingking viewpoint and beach''Nusa Penida’s most famous spot''Kelingking viewpoint is possibly the most photographed place in all of the Nusa Islands but for good reason – it’s stunning! There’s a white sand beach at the bottom of the cliffs that is perfect for exploration as well, though it will involve steep scrambling up and down rocks and steps to get there. If you’re up for it, it’s worth it, though!''Crystal Bay, Broken Beach, Angel’s Billabong''Angel’s Billabong by Georgi Kovachev used under creative commons''I’ve combined these three sights on Nusa Penida since they’re close together and all good to visit in either the early AM hours or later in the evening after the day trippers from Penida have already headed back to Lembongan or Bali. Angel’s Billabong is a crystal clear natural pool, Broken Beach is a cliff lookout over a hole in the rock, and Crystal Bay is popular for its crystal clear blue water, though honestly, you can find a less crowded version in the following spots on Penida.''Peguyangan Waterfall''750 narrow steps but whoa, that view!''This is a steep one with 750 steps but the views are incredible and I loved how secluded most of the experience was, especially heading there later in the afternoon for golden hour. There’s a temple at the bottom of the cliff, though the ‘waterfall’ is more of a show of the waves crashing into the cliffs. There’s a sacred vibe there that had me enchanted, and feeling that it was worth the climb.''Snorkeling trips''Nothing quite as magical as seeing a Manta!''Snorkeling trips to see the Manta rays and the statue garden around Penida are on offer on each of the islands, but they all come to the same place – Manta Point on Nusa Penida. You’ll see signs posted all over the Nusa islands advertising snorkeling trips to Manta Point, or you can head to the point yourself and ask a local to take you out on his boat. For this, negotiate! It all comes down to how long you want to be on the boat for. The more people you can split with, the better.''Sleep:''For night two, I recommend staying at the''Airbnb on the top of the hill'', which is a gorgeous secluded house with a sunset view. (''click here for $25 off your booking!'')''The view from the dining area''Day Four: Sunrise at the treehouse on Penida''For your last night, I recommend heading east to the treehouse for the best sunrise view on the whole island and quite a unique experience.''Rumah Pohon''Just as dreamy as it looks!''To be completely honest, I have mixed feelings about the price of the treehouse given how basic it was, but I still think it’s worth it for the incredible views and the experience of staying there overnight.\xa0If you stay, be sure to bring food and water along with you. It’s a beautiful and rustic experience! You can''read my full review here'',''book it here,''and''get $25 off here.''If you’d rather have more time at the house on the hill from night two you can still drive to Rumah Pohon for sunrise, which will take about an hour, and visit the following beach on your way back:''Suwehan beach''White sand? Check. Pointy rock? Check.''Heading east, this beach also requires a steep climb down but you can get it almost all to yourself. There was unfortunately a lot of trash when I visited, but the water hue is stunning and the sand is white.''Goa Giri Putri Cave Temple''A peek into local culture''This cave temple is a pretty cool cultural experience while on the island. To go inside, don a sarong and climb up a few stairs (of course!), get a blessing with water on your forehead, then climb inside the cave. There are often ceremonies going on inside with locals all wearing white, along with some bats flying around, and chanting.''For more explanation of each of these places, you can read my full''Nusa Penida guide here''.''From there you can head back to the port area where you took the boat in from Lembongan initially. There you can either hire a private boat or take the public ferry back to the yellow bridge, which is what I did. Scoot and Rocky will both pick you up from the parking lot near the yellow bridge if you arrange it with them beforehand to take you back to Bali.''Again, if you can give this entire itinerary more time you’ll be glad you did. I spent about six days on the Nusa Islands but left feeling like I could have spent a whole lot more on Nusa Penida. It truly did feel to me like exactly what I think most people are hoping for when they visit Bali – a mystical, jungly experience with beautiful beaches and dreamy temples.''Pin me!''From there, I highly recommend checking out''Lombok'', my favorite island in Indonesia, or checking out''Keramas beach on Bali'', a beautiful black sand beach without the crowds!''READ NEXT: The Ultimate Guide to Kuta, Lombok''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Nusa Ceningan: Everything You Need to Know''Nusa Lembongan: An Insider’s Guide''Nusa Penida’s Secret Spots''I remember hearing about the Nusa Islands off of Bali in Indonesia years ago. People said it was like Bali used to be before the tourism and development took over. Ever since I’d imagined how it would be – jungly, with friendly people and rocky roads, rugged beaches, and hidden treasures.''When I arrived in Nusa Lembongan, the most popular of the three Nusa Islands, I was disappointed. It’s built up and even those tiny roads can feel hectic at times. It had me wondering if I’d missed the timing on the Nusa Islands.''Then I went to Nusa Penida, the largest and least popular of the three, and found a gorgeous island that those of us who chase off the beaten path places would consider a paradise.''Most people just visit Nusa Penida on a day trip and miss the coolest parts of the island – but this is good news for you and me, since that leaves so much of the island free to explore without crowds. I spent four days on Penida but wish I’d had longer!''These were my favorite things to do while on Nusa Penida:''Kelingking and the usual suspects: Crystal Bay, Broken Beach, Angel’s Billabong''Most day trippers head straight for the most famous photo spot in Nusa Penida: Kelingking viewpoint. From there, it’s a steep climb down to a white sand beach that will require scrambling hand and foot in some parts, but if you can make it down, it’s gorgeous and worth it.''We should probably also establish now that Penida is all about cliffs and stairs. You’ll be getting a workout on this island but hey it offsets the gado gado and fried tempeh so it’s all good, right?''careful swimming here – it’s possible but the waves and current are strong''To avoid the crowds, head to Kelingking earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to enjoy it without the day trippers.''Other favorites include''Crystal Bay'', which is a cove with clear blue water but to be honest, lots of people and boats, and''Angel’s Billabong''and''Broken Beach''.''Angel’s Billabong is a crystal clear natural pool and Broken Beach features a hole in the rock that has been eroded over time by the powerful waves. Both are beautiful but also very popular with day trippers. You’ll also find that there are many rock formations with holes in them all over the island if you explore further than the northwest coast.''These are all worth visiting, particularly in the early morning or later afternoon. However, given I wanted a less touristy experience and knew that I could find it on Penida, I decided to explore other parts of the island that I could get a more secluded experience on, and I succeeded! Read on:''Stay at the Airbnb on the hill''The best view!''The port area on Nusa Penida is where most tourists stay but I found the vibe and views from the middle of the island to be so much better. Picture locals from tiny children to old grannies saying hello and even blowing kisses, big fat pigs oinking from the shady roadside, and tiny villages with no foreigners around and you’ll know what I mean – it all exists in the central parts of the island.''I rented''this AirBnB''(''get $25 off here)''for a couple of days on the island and true to the reviews, it was one of the best places I’ve stayed during my time in Southeast Asia. The sunset views are just incredible, including the view of Bali’s Mount Agung pictured above from the dining area. It was full of butterflies and dragonflies too. It felt like pure magic to me. It’s a great jumping off point for many of the activities around the island as well due to its central location.''Peguyangan Waterfall''My shirt isn’t soaked through with sweat or anything''I promised stairs and we are delivering stairs with this spot – about 750 of them to be exact! I think we should also talk about the lack of waterfall.''Could you still be convinced to go, though? This is less about the ‘waterfall’ and more about the views on the way down and back up. Get the experience of a sacred temple while watching the powerful waves smash into the cliff face in a powerful display.''So powerful – be sure to bring a sarong with you to cover your legs when at the temple''It’s also a chance to complete a rite of passage that every Balinese Hindu is expected to do in his/her lifetime.''Most tourists who visit Nusa Penida probably have no idea that this is known locally as the ‘black magic island.’ Nusa Penida has historically been the island where the evil and dark spirits were banished to by priests on Bali’s mainland. However Balinese beliefs strongly emphasize balance – both of the good and the bad. Therefore for the Balinese, Penida is an important spiritual destination. By visiting this temple where fresh water runs into the sea (the ‘waterfall’) you get to be part of this pilgrimage as well. If you open yourself up to it, you can feel a profoundly strong spiritual presence there.''To visit, I recommend sturdy shoes, plenty of water, and a sarong. This one could be tough for those with a fear of heights as the stairs are only about a half a foot-length each.''The Treehouse – Rumah Pohon''Just as dreamy as it looks!''Looking back at these photos now I have to pinch myself and ask if it was all just a dream. Following a lovely stay on the top of the hill, I moved east to this treehouse for a night of watching the moonlight and sunrise over the bay at Atuh King Five – an outcropping of islets near Atuh Beach.''This was great for just one night – though there are some drawbacks. The climb down to the treehouse involves, you guessed it, more steep stairs! The room is incredibly basic and overpriced, it sways with every movement, and\xa0the bathroom leaves much to be desired. You’ll have people asking often if they can take pictures on the stairs, or maybe just climbing right up before asking, but at night you will mostly get it to yourself and you really can’t beat this sunrise view.''It’s real. I know, hard to believe!''If you stay, be sure to bring food and water along with you. It’s a beautiful and rustic experience! Read my''full review of the treehouse here''. You can''book it here''(and''get $25 off here).''Suwehan beach''White sand? Check. Pointy rock? Check.''Are you ready for more stairs? I can feel your excitement from here!''All kidding aside, if you can embrace another afternoon of exercise, this white sand beach is fairly secluded and the water color is stunning.''Sadly when I was there a lot of trash was washing up on the beach. This is a huge problem all over Indonesia and Southeast Asia in general. Still, it was nice to get a beach almost all to myself and to get some exercise while I was at it. There are 350 steps (I counted!) but they’re big, steep steps and the climb is about on par with all the others mentioned on this list.''Snorkeling trips''Nothing quite as magical as seeing a Manta!''Snorkeling trips to see the Manta rays and the statue garden around Penida are on offer on each of the islands, but they all come to the same place – Manta Point on Nusa Penida. You’ll see signs posted all over the Nusa Islands advertising snorkeling trips to Manta Point, or you can head to the point yourself and ask a local to take you out on his boat. For this, negotiate! It all comes down to how long you want to be on the boat for. The more people you can split with, the better.''In my experience it’s usually around $100 for a boat for the whole day, visiting various different snorkeling spots. To me this will always beat an organized tour. You can ask the people at your guesthouse to help you organize this or do it in person yourself with the boatman.''Goa Giri Putri Cave Temple''A peek into local culture''This cave temple is a pretty cool cultural experience while on the island. To go inside, don a sarong and climb up a few stairs (of course!), get a blessing with water on your forehead, then climb inside the cave. There are often ceremonies going on inside with locals all wearing white, along with some bats flying around, and chanting.''Getting to Nusa Penida''Unfortunately there are no boats from Bali or Lombok that go directly to Nusa Penida. Unless you take a day tour, you’ll need to head to Lembongan first and then take a boat over to Nusa Penida.''Click here''to read about the ferry schedule and options to Lembongan from Bali.''Once on Lembongan you have two choices for getting to Penida – you can ask to be dropped off at the mangroves and hire a private boat for around 400,000 IDR, or you can head to the yellow bridge and take the public ferry which costs 50,000 and leaves periodically when full. If you take Scoot or Rocky Fast cruises they both include transport to the bridge or mangroves in the boat ticket price.''I hope this guide helped to convince you to spend more than just a day on Nusa Penida. I think most people have it all wrong by spending the bulk of their time on Nusa Lembongan and only popping over to Penida for a day trip.

Banff, Alberta''Johnston Canyon in Banff National Park''Alberta was my first stop ever in Canada and by the time I left, I was seriously asking myself if I should just come back and move in.''Alberta is a winter wonderland''with snow-shoeing tracks, nordic skiing, ice climbing, and ice fishing all nearby. It’s also home to excellent downhill skiing in Banff and Lake Louise. In the summer, it’s the perfect jumping off point for hiking trails galore.''Though everywhere in Canada has its own special beauty, this part of Alberta sure is a standout.''2. Icefields Parkway, Alberta''“When it comes to incredible scenery, you can’t go past the Icefields Parkway in Alberta. The road is often described as the ‘most beautiful drive in the world’ and it’s easy to see why. Snow-capped mountains line both sides of the road, a river runs through the valley, waterfalls tumble down across the rocks and several glaciers are within easy reach.''The Icefields Parkway is not particularly long – 233 kilometres from Jasper to Lake Louise – and is easy to do in one direction in a day, even with all the stops. And it’s these stops that make it perfect for a solo traveller. You’ll never have a chance to get bored on this drive because there are constantly places you’ll want to get out of the car to take photos and explore off the road. And then, regardless of which direction you go, you’ll find friendly towns with lots of other travellers at the end of the road trip, in Jasper or Banff National Parks.” – Michael of''Time Travel Turtle''3. Winnipeg, Manitoba''Fields of gold (somewhere outside of Winnipeg)''When I told some Canadian friends that I was heading to Winnipeg for a couple weeks last summer they scratched their heads and asked why. This must be Canada’s most underrated province yet it’s probably the friendliest and one of the least crowded to travel through in the summer months. It also has thousands of lakes so if you’re into paddling, it’s the perfect place to get some solitude.''I joined a''multi-day canoeing adventure''right out of Winnipeg, enjoyed the summer Fringe Festival, and took a road trip around Lake Winnipeg (you can read more about that on my Manitoba writeup on''Alamo’s Scenic Drive'').''4. Montreal, Quebec''“Montreal is an absolutely amazing city that combines the best of North America and Europe into one very walkable place. The people are friendly and there is a ton to do. Old Montreal is full of cafes and European charm and a perfect way to spend a''Sunday''. Centre-ville is the main part of Montreal and has everything you could want, bars, restaurants, museums and culture. The people in the city are beautiful and incredibly fashion forward. The city would certainly be more enjoyable, however, if you speak French and could be slightly intimidating to a solo traveler that doesn’t speak any French at all (most people in Montreal do speak English, but a little bit of French does go a long way).” – Paige of''Miss Travel''5. Ottawa, Ontario''“Despite being the Capital city of Canada, Ottawa is often skipped over for the bigger, brighter cities of Toronto and Montreal. However, for solo travellers, Ottawa is a a great choice. Part of Ottawa’s charm is that it has the big city attractions with a friendly small town feel and lots of green space. It’s also really easy to get around. Museums, art galleries, parks, the parliament buildings, and the historic Byward Market are all within walking distance of one another.''Ottawa is also a student city, with two large universities and a college, so there are plenty of young people around. Plus, Ottawa locals are known to be super friendly. It’s pretty common to strike up a conversation with a complete stranger while waiting for a coffee or while admiring artwork in the National Gallery of Canada. If you visit during the summer head to Major’s Hill Park or Nepean point. Both are favourite hangout spots for locals looking to soak up the sun.” – Hannah of''Eat Sleep Breathe Travel''6. Killarney Provincial Park, Ontario''“Solo travel is obviously a lot about spending time on your own, but I’ve never felt so alone (in a good way) as I did in Killarney Provincial Park. This is THE place to try canoe camping: paddle from lake to lake, pitch your tent in solitude near the water shore and climb the surrounding granite hills for gorgeous views. The park is so beautiful, it inspired members of the Ontario Society of Artists to capture it in numerous of their paintings and watercolours. During the summer you should leave your flysheet in the bag and sleep under the starry sky, listen closely to the noises of the forest and spot local wildlife from your sleeping bag!''For safety and additional paddle power, I hired a guide from Killarney Outfitters. They also provided all the gear and food necessary for a successful and bear-free weekend in the park. If this is your first canoe camping trip – like it was for me – I can only recommend heading out with a guide who is experienced and skilled in order to keep you safe and entertained.” – Kathi from''Watch Me See''7. Vancouver Island, British Columbia''“Vancouver Island is a fantastic destination for solo travellers who love the outdoors. It has all the gorgeous scenery of the Pacific North West with even more snowy mountains, and all on an\xa0island off the west coast of Canada. Don’t miss the rugged coastline of Tofino, surrounded by ancient rainforest and with some of the best surfing and whale watching you can find,\xa0worth visiting in both summer and winter. If you’re on the island from May to September, the West Coast Trail is a 5 to 7 day hike in the Pacific Rim National Park that calls itself the\xa0“hike of a lifetime”. Check out Victoria, the capital of British Colombia and the biggest city on Vancouver Island, which feels kind of like a British city transplanted in Canada, but with a hippy vibe.\xa0The people are friendly and often environmentally conscious, which is no surprise given the beautiful surroundings they live in. You can explore Vancouver Island by public transport, hiring\xa0a car, or hitchhiking, which is fairly common on the island.” – Sonja of''Migrating Miss''8. Vancouver, British Columbia''“Canada was actually one of the first places I ever traveled to solo. I fell in love with the country – and in particular with beautiful Vancouver! For me, Vancouver is one of the few places in the world which has everything – beach, the mountains, beautiful nature, and a big city life. The city center of Vancouver is easily accessible by public transport foot and even by foot, making it perfect for solo travelers. There’s a wide range of good accommodations, from hostels to hotels – or just try Couchsurfing. That’s what I did, and I met some great people. It’s true that Canadians are the friendliest people on earth!''A place you can’t miss is the beautiful Stanley Park, offering you beautiful views of the harbor and on the skyline. If you’re looking for a nice workout, hike up the Grouse Grind – you’ll be rewarded by spectacular views of the city. Afterwards, you can relax on the city beach and enjoy the sunset.''For me, Vancouver is the perfect city – enjoy your visit!” – Patrick of''German Backpacker''9. Sunshine Coast, British Columbia''“Everyone loves Vancouver and rightfully so. It is perfect for the solo traveller with its bustling bars and jumping hostels but visitors keep missing a gem over the water, Canada’s Sunshine Coast. The Sunshine Coast is made up of lots of small towns and even more lakes. Getting around is the only stumbling block for solo travellers as the bus service isn’t that well connected. However, that really isn’t an issue because the types of travellers that hit the Coast in BC are relaxed, friendly and always willing to take others along with them on their trip.''Staying at Up The Creek in Roberts Creek comes highly recommended for its relaxed vibes, hammocks on the porch and free bikes to pedal to the bigger towns of Sechelt and Gibsons. Don’t be fooled by the one shop village status, Roberts Creek has a big social calendar of live bands and fayres. The number of return visitors (family, couple, adventure, yoga loving, or solo) is a testament to just how lovely the Sunshine Coast is.” – Gemma of''Two Scots Abroad''10. Calgary, Alberta''“Calgary is basically Canada’s answer to Denver. A hip, modern city that’s an easy drive to Banff and the rest of the Canadian Rockies, the city itself is small with a distinct neighborhood vibe. Take in the views from Calgary Tower, stop by Canada Olympic Park, and peruse the boutiques, restaurants, and bars downtown on Stephen Avenue Walk. If you come in July, the Calgary Stampede is the big summer to-do with rodeos, concerts and Western events that make for a two-week party.” – Lauren of''The Down Lo''11. Quebec City, Quebec''“What intrigues and excites me about Quebec City is the French influence on everything, be it food, architecture or the spoken language. You will wonder if Canada has a Narnia-like hidden wardrobe that leads you into France! The colorful buildings with their fairytale-esque appearance add to this illusion. Fear not if you don’t know French though, Quebec City is mostly bilingual. However, not everyone speaks fluent English, so keep a map of the city handy and I advise you to learn a few useful sentences in French.''Based on JUST one statistic, Quebec City already ranks high for solo female travelers – province with the lowest crime rate in Canada. Other factors that will push Quebec City to the top of the list are – friendly locals, year round beauty and activities, art and culture, bike friendly destination and that sweet.. sweet.. Maple Taffy!” – Pari of''Traveling Pari''12. Kananaskis Country, Alberta''“I have taken many exhilarating solo trips to such far flung places as post-earthquake Haiti and Mali in West Africa, but as a native Albertan, one of my absolute favorite places in the world is a lesser-known outdoor gem called “Kananaskis Country.” This large natural area consists of multiple provincial parks stitched-together along Highway 40 which is about an hour drive west of Calgary. With soaring Rocky Mountain vistas, pristine glacier lakes, stunning alpine meadows and a fraction of the crowds that Banff National Park attracts, K Country is a world-class destination in its own right, and offers plenty of opportunities for a solo trip in the mountains.''Active women can get lost in the beautiful sights and dizzying heights on any of the superlative hiking, cycling, and cross-country ski trails that will suit all skill levels. As always when travelling solo, some safety precautions should be taken, so always leave your itinerary with a trusted friend or family member and carry bear spray when on the trails. Making noise is the best deterrent against run ins with carnivores so sing a song to yourself like no one is listening, except for the bears!''For a taste of rustic luxury, book yourself into the beautiful and remote Mount Engadine Lodge and sample the delicious locally inspired cuisine while watching the sun set over the meadow from the lodge’s expansive wrap-around deck. Included in the nightly rates are afternoon high tea with scrumptious treats, an award-worthy dinner, hearty breakfast and a packed lunch to take with you on any number of the adventures accessible from the area. In the winter, you could snowshoe onto the lodge’s meadow, or ski any of amazing nearby trails. In the warmer months, there are endless hiking opportunities and the chance to cycle to the top of the highest paved road in Canada. The possibilities are limited only by how much energy you have.''For ladies seeking a more relaxing retreat in the mountains, check into the Delta Hotels Kananaskis Lodge for a weekend of pampering and fine dining in the most gorgeous mountain setting.''If Kananaskis is not on your radar for solo female travel already, it should be now. Its exhilarating mountain scenery and breathtaking adventures will give any adventurous woman the chance to get away from it all in the most incredible setting.” – Thea of''Zen Travellers''13. Toronto, Ontario''“Despite Canada being my neighbor, I’ve not explored it as much as I’d like to say. I grew up going to Niagara Falls a lot and I’ve been to the charming and breath-taking Victoria. Last fall, however, I took my first solo trip to Canada and my first trip ever to Toronto. Like many do, I fell head over heels for this diverse city. Toronto is perfect for a solo traveler and even an inexperienced one at that. The city is easy to navigate, I never felt unsafe (don’t ever let your guard down though), and the city is extremely walkable but there is also great public transportation. I stayed in both a hostel and couchsurfed during my time there and both proved perfect for meeting other people and bettered my solo experience even more!''My favorite things to do include exploring the extensive street art including Graffiti Alley and Underpass Park, spending a day in Kensington Market wandering through the shops and sampling food, finding unique coffee shops (my favorite was Odin – a Scandinavian inspired cafe and bar) and eating my way through Toronto. You can find just about any cuisine imaginable in Toronto and as a vegan, I had absolutely no trouble eating to my heart’s content. Don’t forget to keep your eyes peeled as you’re walking around to see all the fun and eclectic parts of the cities such as an entire store devoted to condoms, a Harry Potter themed shop, and a dog fountain.” – Ashley of''The Southern Gypsy''“My first experience with Toronto was when I arrived for the annual International Film Festival when the city is teeming with movie stars and film hopefuls..\xa0 I was pleasantly surprised to find the city easy to navigate on my own by foot, subway or tram.\xa0 You can peek into the historical past at the Fairmont Royal York Hotel and Casa Loma castle; marvel at the modern CN Tower and indulge in the farmers market offerings at the St. Lawrence Market.\xa0 When you look past the poutine you’ll find a city of diverse food neighborhoods (Little Italy, Little Portugal, Leslieville and The Annex) and food trucks serving a (really good)\xa0 taste of the world.\xa0 Uniquely Toronto attractions are The Hockey Hall of Fame, Bata Shoe Museum (yes a museum celebrating shoes!) and shopping at Hudson’s Bay. Toronto celebrates its residents and welcomes new guests with warm Canadian hospitality so that your visit is one of many yet to come.” – Suzanne of''Phila Travel Girl''Bonus: Music Festivals''“Canada is without a doubt one of the most picturesque countries in the world, so that means it’s home to plenty of pretty amazing venue locations for events. I’d argue it’s also the best country in the world to attend a music festival by yourself, because Canadians are the nicest people in the world! So polite, kind, and unbelievably. There are tons of incredible music festivals in Canada to choose from, but I’d personally recommend events like Shambhala, Astral Harvest, Motion Notion, and Osheaga Festival if you’re looking for a solid party! The festival atmosphere is truly intoxicating at these events, and I guarantee you’ll leave the festival with so many new amazing friends. While most people would never think of attending an event like this alone – it can be one of the most rewarding experiences!” – Dave of''Jones Around The World''Those are a few of our favorite places to travel in Canada, though the list in the world’s second largest country is, of course, probably endless! For safety, outdoor adventures, beauty, and easy-to-navigate cities with plenty to do year-round, Canada has it all.''Did we miss anything that should be on this list?

She and her friend drove me around to some of the hidden spots in Dumaguete until it was time for me to check into my hotel.\xa0I couldn’t believe how kind and generous that was of her.''I love that''Ferna''is a fellow solo female traveler smashing stereotypes in her home country by traveling solo in her late 30s. My time with her made me realize how truly generous people in the Philippines can be and set the tone for the rest of my trip.''Hey Noel''Next on Siquijor, a local named Noel saw me eating alone in his family’s restaurant and asked me how the food was. We got to talking and something about his vibe prompted me to ask if he knew where I could find a shaman. It turned out I’d asked the right person and the rest is history (''more in this post'').''Siquijor really opened my heart. It felt like everyone I came across smiled warmly at me and said hello. Kids excitedly waved and shouted hello to me on their way to school. Even the big and burly security guard at the ferry terminal softened and said, ‘Nice tattoo! I have a geometric one too!’ showing me his sleeve as I passed through. I’ll probably also always remember when I came across a group of off-duty police and they kindly asked if they could take pictures with me, and each one wanted to have his own, plus the group pic.''Gotta love these cute interactions.''Next on the flight over from Cebu to Siargao, I offered my window seat to a local girl who I could tell really wanted to film out the window with her GoPro. She lit up and excitedly swapped seats with me. Eventually we took selfies together (I seriously don’t know how many selfies I’m in with locals but safe to say almost 100 at this point) and she warmly welcomed me to her country.''After that, I met up with another local girl, Arjaylyn, again via Instagram, on Siargao. Get this – she insisted on buying me lunch on HER birthday – I tried to offer to pay but she wasn’t having it. She also saved the day by offering me her motorbike rental which still had a day left on it, which I was able to extend. I’d spent quite a while before we met up trying to locate one and finding them all booked.''There was also that family who gave me a chair and took photos with me when I got a flat tire (''video here''), the grandma who asked me if I was traveling alone and gave me a thumbs up and said, “Good, good. More free.”''It wasn’t just these interactions, though, it was also those little momentary smiles while I was passing by, the kids who stuck out their hands for a high-five when I drove by on my scooter, and the people who smiled and asked what my name was, and where I was going.''That’s not to say that it was all rosy. There were more catcalls on Siargao than I would have liked, but that just leaves some room for improvement and unfortunately this is a worldwide epidemic.''But overall the Philippines turned out to be one of the friendliest places I’d been. I just had to be a friendly person to see it.''I’m glad I went back and had a change of heart. All of the things that bothered me before evaporated this time. I can confidently say now that this is a place I’ll return to, excited to explore more and meet more people.''Thanks to everyone who welcomed me without knowing how I’d initially felt.

I recall arriving and feeling like it had really lived up to the promises of beautiful beachfront resorts with those pools in the villas facing the ocean. I’ve always thought of Bali that way since – the perfect place for a romantic hideaway or a peaceful spot for personal reflection.''It’s the combination of spirituality and beautiful nature that makes it so enchanting.''The thing about Bali is it’s so attractive that it’s also one of the most visited places in the world. Some of it feels like just a cheaper Australia, but the good news about that is most of the beach tourists are concentrated in the same areas and you don’t have to wander too far from the airport or jumping off points for the Nusa Islands to get a beach almost all to yourself.''The ideal Bali with nice peaceful beaches and beautiful pool villas is still around, it’s just about finding the right place before everyone else does.''I discovered that this time when I found''Komaneka at Keramas'', a new set of villas over rice paddies with a black sand beach so dreamy that for sunrise I only had to share it with fishermen and a few people riding horseback (what a good idea!).''At the end of my three month journey in Southeast Asia, I was delighted to find that this volcanic black sand beach is perfectly peaceful and for the surfers out there, there’s a pretty nice wave with almost no one else on it – a rarity these days!''At the time of this writing, there are just nine villas at''Komaneka''at Keramas, although a few more are in the works. There’s an Olympic size pool right on the property, though each villa comes with its own pool as well. I just love having options, and that kind of privacy!''The villas are absolutely gorgeous, with a nice king size bed, a bathtub that they will happily fill with fragrant flowers, and a floating breakfast available at no extra cost.''There’s also an outdoor shower (are you an enthusiast like I am?), as well as an indoor shower, and an open walk-in closet that a girl could fall in love with.''The grounds are amazing as well, set far back from the road through layers of rice paddies, featuring a cat walk from the lobby, to the restaurant, to the villas on a raised platform over the paddies. I love how they were worked into the existing design of the place.''I also love that it’s Balinese-owned, but as far as the comfort, amenities, and the delicious restaurant, it really caters to an international crowd. To me this would be perfect for a romantic getaway, honeymoon, or honestly just on your own. There was a mix of families, couples, and solo travelers. The idea is to get away from it all in peace and quiet, which is exactly what you get here.''Location-wise, it’s only about 30 minutes away from Ubud, which is full of shops selling everything from clothing to crystals, and cafes serving up raw vegan food. You’ll also find the famous Monkey Temple there. I loved that I could have the best of both worlds while still being able to stay on the beach and wake up to a golden sunrise. It only takes about 30 minutes to an hour to access the airport and the major ports as well.''As far as where to stay in Bali, this is my beach pick! It’s tranquil, uncrowded, unique with the black sand, centrally-located for a lot of key Bali activities and the airport, east-facing for a gorgeous sunrise, quiet, and with delicious food. Could a girl want for more?''Not this one.''You can book your villa here''. Happy loving in Bali!''Pin me!''*Thanks, Komaneka at Keramas for hosting my stay. My feelings towards the gorgeous hotel, the delicious food, and the perfect Bali getaway are all my own.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Nusa Ceningan: Everything You Need to Know''Learn to surf in Bali: The Best Spots for Beginners!''Nusa Lembongan: An Insider’s Guide''Bali has been romanticized in books and movies for its dreamy temples and the sacred vibes, but these days, it’s lost a lot of its charm due to the overwhelming popularity. Thankfully there’s another option – the Nusa Islands.''The Nusa Islands are, to me, the perfect option for those who want to experience Bali without the crowds and traffic. The culture is much the same, but the beaches and surf breaks have far fewer people, especially Nusa Ceningan.''It’s often referred to as the Bali of 30 years ago.''The Blue Lagoon on Nusa Ceningan''There are three Nusa islands and they’re easy to reach via a short ferry ride from Bali.''Nusa Ceningan is the smallest, nestled between Lembongan and Penida. While it’s not nearly as popular as Nusa Lembongan, I actually think it’s the much, much better option between the two. It’s quieter, more beautiful, and has less traffic.''I stayed on Nusa Lembongan and did a quick day trip over to Ceningan, however I’d reverse it if I were to do it over again, and stay on Ceningan and bike over to Lembongan for the main sights like Devil’s Tears.''The bridge – cool to drive across!''For the best way to get to Nusa Ceningan, read the first section of the''Lembongan guide''for the ferry info from Bali, then take a motorbike over the yellow bridge – it’s quick and easy. If you’d rather not take a motorbike, you can get a truck ride over to the crossing, take a short boat ride over, and ask your accommodation on Ceningan to come pick you up. They may even be willing to do so from Lembongan.''Things to do''It’s easy to hit the main tourist attractions on Nusa Ceningan in an afternoon, though if you pool and beach club-hop around the island, it could easily stretch into a nice relaxing week! These are a few of the highlights:''The Sand''Yes, please''Upon crossing the bridge over to Ceningan you’ll notice how dazzlingly blue and clear the water is. I’ve honestly never seen a shade that baby blue anywhere else. If you veer right, one of the first things you’ll come to is''The Sand'', a funky,\xa0open air bar and restaurant.''I loved the light colors of the driftwood bar, the swings, and especially the hammocks over the water! They have a daily happy hour starting at 4pm and when I went, three puppies (though they do tend to grow). I love that they serve their drinks with paper straws as well. A+ for caring about the environment, guys!''The Blue Lagoon''How can this be real?!''About 3 minutes from The Sand you’ll see a sign for the Blue Lagoon on your left and trust me when I say you’ve never seen water this baby blue in your life. I’ve searched high and low all over the tropics and it just isn’t this hue anywhere else!''The cliffs over the water provide the perfect vantage point for the amazing lagoon. There’s also a cliff jump, which you can see directly across from me in the photo above, though rumor is it’s now closed due to the dangers. That said, it’s easy enough to walk to if you’re determined. You’ll need to keep an eye on the waves for safety’s sake if you decide to attempt it.''Mahana Point Cliff Jump''The jump from the Sunset Huts nearby, which has a beach access if you want to get in the water without paying''For a smaller and more manageable cliff jump, you’ll find Mahana Point across the street from the Blue Lagoon. It’s a bit annoying as the small jump costs 25,000 IDR and the higher one costs 50,000 IDR per jump, so there aren’t that many people jumping.''However, the restaurant at the Point serves up a nice no-frills lunch and the view of the surfers and Bali’s Mt. Agung in the background sure is beautiful.''Secret Beach''Trevally at Secret Beach''Secret Beach is another popular stop on Nusa Ceningan and while lovely, this is probably best for at least a few hours of chilling and eating rather than for a quick dip.\xa0The hotel on the beach, Villa Trevally, requests that those who use the beach at least spend 35k at the restaurant, or 100k for use of the pool and the beach. The road to get there leaves much to be desired as well.''At this point I was a bit annoyed that everything seemed to be privatized and cost money to enjoy so I kept exploring.''Zipline at Driftwood Bar''The Zipline at Driftwood Bar is probably one of the most picturesque ziplines in the world, zooming over that baby blue water. It’s a short zipline and costs 80k. Afterwards, enjoy the infinity pool and the view.''Surf''Not a bad surf spot!''Ceningan is another great spot on the Nusa Islands for surfing. The main spot is near Mahana Point as mentioned above. When I was there, I only saw 5 surfers in the water. Not bad if you want a wave almost to yourself!''Diving and Snorkeling Excursions''You’ll see diving and snorkeling shops all over the island, though''Ceningan Divers''has the best reviews. Dive in the mangroves, rent a SUP, and take a snorkeling tour over to Penida to swim with the Manta Rays.''Yoga''If you’re into yoga, you can get your fix without having to travel over to Nusa Lembongan! Ceningan Yoga Shala offers classes for every skill level. My only yoga experience was at Yoga Shack on Nusa Lembongan so I can’t comment on the quality of classes, though it’s rated well on Trip Advisor. Find the schedule''here''.''When it comes to laid back islands with plenty of comfortable accommodation options, Nusa Ceningan seems perfect to me. Though I wish some of the activities, like beaches and cliff jumping, were free. That said, other awesome things like the bridge crossing, the Blue Lagoon, and surfing all were, so it’s all about balance!''If you’re deciding between Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan, I hope this edged you a bit closer towards Ceningan.

The low barrier to entry means that thousands of people per year start a travel blog, so how can you make sure that you stand out?''There’s a multi-national conference dedicated just to travel blogging, there are countless books on the subject, and multiple courses out there with all kinds of advice and conflicting info on how to run a successful travel blog that pays you. It’s enough to make your head spin, right?''I’ve been at this for four years and make a six-figure income from it now,\xa0and at every stage of my career as a blogger,\xa0the game has changed and the stakes have risen. Whether you’re brand new or just want to elevate your site’s money-making potential, a course has the power to really help you get to where you want to be. The price tag of a\xa0few hundred bucks for that kind of catalyst\xa0is a steal, if and only if it’s a good course with helpful info, though. This post previously compared the two biggest courses out there,''Travel Blog Success''and''Nomadic Matt’s Superstar Blogging''. Now\xa0that Superstar Blogging has acquired Travel Blog Success, you just got double the value for your money, so it’s basically a no-brainer.''In the spirit of full disclosure, Nomadic Matt’s Superstar Blogging does give me an affiliate commission.\xa0However, nobody asked me to write a review and I didn’t seek anyone’s approval\xa0to write this (freedom of speech, y’all).''So I’m gon’ say what I want''Without further ado, here are my reviews of Superstar blogging:''Who they are and what they promise''Both Travel Blog Success and Superstar Blogging courses were founded and are run by successful travel bloggers and both include webinars and tips from industry experts. They promise the same thing: They’ll teach you how to make money off of a travel blog. However, the way that they arrive there is different.''Travel Blog Success:''Founded by David Lee of''Gobackpacking.com''and''Medellinliving.com''. Dave’s obviously a smart guy who knows how to run successful businesses, including the long-running and successful Travel Blog Success.''The course’s tagline is, “Do you wish your blog paid for your vacations?” It focuses on networking, learning how to pitch, and one of its biggest selling points is the secret Facebook group. That’s actually what got me to sign up in the first place. The course used to cost $447 though now it’s been rolled into Superstar Blogging so it’s free!''Superstar Blogging:''Founded by Matt Kepnes of''nomadicmatt.com''. Matt runs the most-visited and most popular travel blog on the planet. He gets over 1 million hits per month to his site and is one of the savviest bloggers in the biz.''His course’s selling point is taking your passion to the next level, no matter where you are in the game. Since Matt doesn’t make his money by pitching tourism boards, the focus of this course is professionalizing your blog and making it into a business that generates its own cash flow. The course costs $349.''Who Wins: Superstar Blogging''There’s a glaring difference between what each course advertises. TBS focuses on building a blog that can pay for your travels and, alarmingly to me, celebrates when people with really small followings get things like free hotel stays (Side note: How is that a good thing? It bamboozles the hotel which will get no value and devalues the blog at the same time).''Superstar Blogging\xa0focuses more on branding and professionalization to make blogging a long-term prospect. For me, since this is my career and not a hobby, that’s super important.''Because I want to be making this''The Modules''The course modules are built around how to start and run a blog, from the very basics to specifics around money-making strategies and SEO.''If you’re brand new to blogging, the modules from TBS are very thorough and helpful\xa0with getting started and setting up a solid blog. There’s a lot of great stuff in there that, when supplemented with the Facebook group, is really helpful to someone who is just starting out.''Where it previoulsy fell flat for me was\xa0beyond those basics. However now that it’s combined with Superstar blogging, you get the full package.''Superstar Blogging\xa0has all of the basics of blogging as well, but also covers pitching media, going viral, and goes deeper into SEO.''Digital nomad = freedom (if done right)''The Webinars''The webinars are, for me, where the course really shines. I have learned more from the webinars than from any other part of the course, mostly because the people Matt got for the Superstar Blogging webinars are at the top of their game not just in travel blogging, but in all industries.''Some are Q&A sessions and others are webinars with power point presentations attached. I learned quite a bit from the Instagram and pitching webinars, specifically.''Matt\xa0didn’t just ask travel bloggers for their advice, but went way above and beyond by going to the absolute experts on each individual subject. For SEO, he interviewed Rand Fishkin of''Moz.com'', and for affiliate marketing, he went to Pat Flynn of''smartpassiveincome.com''. He even interviewed Ryan Holiday, author of''Trust Me, I’m Lying''. You basically can’t find better experts than those guys for their respective areas of expertise.''Though I have a lot of respect for my successful travel blogging peers and know that I have a lot to learn from them, nobody within travel blogging is as much of an expert as the guys who are outside of the industry and are experts specifically in SEO or affiliate marketing. I know that the guys Matt interviewed know what they’re talking about because they’ve dedicated their lives to their subjects and most of them are millionaires as a result of their efforts. Their advice is invaluable.''Facebook Groups''Facebook groups are where the discussions go down. It’s a place to ask questions and (hopefully) talk strategy.''My whole reason for joining the course was to get access to the exclusive Facebook group. It’s a place where people discuss strategy and reveal what’s working for them.''The group has since grown to almost 1600 people. There’s something to be said for the power of smaller groups or mastermind groups, where people are more likely to talk strategy and specifics, however this big group is still a good place to ask questions from tech to Pinterest and everything in-between.''I still feel that the group is useful, though less so than when it was small and brand new. I suggest utilizing this group for general questions and help when you need a lot of eyes to see your post, and opting for smaller, niche groups when you’ve grown and want to talk specific strategy. You can build these yourself, or look for groups like the 100k+ bloggers group when you’ve grown to that size.''Who would I pick, then?''Is Superstar Blogging worth it?''As someone who relied on Travel Blog Success and Superstar Blogging for a lot of her strategy and success, I can say yes, as long as you milk it for all it’s worth. Now that you get both courses for one, it’s a no-brainer to me. It can help you become a very effective travel blogger who makes a real living at this. There are a lot of pros:''It’s cheap for what you get and includes a lot of freebies to services that are helpful and essential to blogging''It gives you access to Matt to ask questions, and trust me, this is''very''valuable, especially now while the course is still small and he can give people in the Facebook group more individualized attention.''It goes deep into SEO (for almost all travel blogs, search engines are the biggest driver of traffic, so this is important)''It’s much more focused on the business and branding aspect of blogging.''You get occasional freebies and tech support, and this is where the course starts to pay you back.''Whether you’re just starting out or are more established, the advice in Superstar Blogging is great. When I had a friend just starting out, this is the course I recommended to her because I thought it would help her out the most.''I hope this has helped you to figure out if a course is for you. It saves a ton of time and gives you access to people who are already successful and know what they’re doing.

Then again, just about everything I’ve done since then would have blown 25-year-old me’s mind.''I view my body now like a vessel for the journey and the adventure of life that is constantly unfolding. My ink tells a story of where I’ve been, and guides me when I need a reminder of where and what to return to. These are my stories, followed by a few other women who have gorgeous travel tattoos:''Each tattoo of mine has a unique story to go along with it, so I made the video above to show you a closer look at my ink, along with my personal story behind each one and what they mean to me. Here’s a more factual explanation of each tattoo to go along with it:''Hah Taew, five lines:''The Hah Taew on my shoulder is a''sak yant given to me by a monk in Thailand''. He chose the tattoo, he placed it on my shoulder without me knowing what I would get, and he blessed it. The first line cleans out unwanted spirits, the second reverses bad fortune, the third protects against black magic, the fourth energizes good luck, and the fifth is to gain charisma.''Gao Yord, nine spires:''This is also a protective tattoo to bring loving kindness, power, good fortune and luck, magical protection, and many other related blessings. The spires reach up towards the heavens and below each is a Buddha represented by the set of ovals under each of the spires.''Om:''The most sacred mantra in Hinduism and Buddhism and the opening of many prayers. It’s difficult to pinpoint a definition as Om can be everything all at once – the universe, the past, present, and future, and extends beyond the limits of time. It’s meant to be felt all throughout the body and soul when one chants it. I got this on my ankle in Kathmandu after completing the''Annapurna Circuit''and Sanctuary treks as a reminder of where my feet carried me.''Sacred geometry and Mandalas:''Sacred geometry is all about the harmony between geometric ratios, nature, and a higher power. For my leg, it flows with the natural curve of my body, blooming into mandalas, which are 2D representations of the universe, common in Hinduism.''It may seem from all of this that I’m a religious person although I don’t think my spirituality fits any one definition. I have studied and learned about Buddhism and Hinduism, have participated in Vipassana retreats and rituals encompassing parts of them, and I see truth in a lot of different places and through many combinations of what I’ve learned – my truth, which is different from anyone else’s. Maybe that doesn’t make much sense, but for me, it makes perfect sense, and it’s what I’ve chosen to display on my body.''For now I love what I have. I love that they’re all pretty easy to hide, and that they make a statement when I choose to show them. Perhaps I’ll get more but as I said before, the old me would never have imagined what I’d have ink and life-wise now, so it naturally makes sense that present me has no idea what future me might do!''These are just my stories and etchings in time and skin, and I wanted to share a few more as well. Here are several more beautiful tattoos and the stories behind them:''The Bucket List Sleeve''“I have a random computer algorithm that chooses destinations from my 600+ item bucket list and when I’m done checking things off, I get them added to my bucket list sleeve. Well, it started out as a sleeve but now it goes up over my shoulder and down my back, so I’m not sure what you call that! I’ve attached a photo showing Big Ben in London, the Equator in Uganda, and a hot air balloon ride I did over the temples of Bagan, Myanmar. Not shown are part of the Acropolis in Athens and a mountain gorilla with whom I had a close encounter in Uganda. I’m pretty far behind on the tattoo as I’ve checked off over 100 bucket list items, though!” – Leslie of''My Adventure Bucket''A Compass to Find Her Way''“After silently suffering from Anxiety Disorder and Depression, I decided to leave my “good job” and backpack through South East Asia. I wanted to have something that would remind me of how valuable life and time is to me.\xa0 As a traveler, I wanted something to represent travel and never “losing my way” in life. So, I found a compass that I loved and decided Thailand would be a good of a place as any!” – Rachel of''Rachel Travels''Antarctic Coordinates''“I have the GPS coordinates to the Antarctic peninsula\xa0on my left ankle. It’s a simple tattoo with an important story. After a difficult divorce at 27 years old, I set a goal for myself to reach my 7th continent by the time I turned 30. It seemed almost impossible, but I set foot on the continent of Antarctica one week before my 30th birthday, in March of 2017. This trip was so meaningful to me because it meant reclaiming a part of my identity (love of travel) that had been suppressed in my marriage, as well as reasserting my financial independence. And I did it! So I got this tattoo to remind myself of everything I went through + everything I accomplished.''I got the tattoo in Seattle with my then-fiancé, now-husband while we’re on a year-long cross-country road trip. It was pretty much the perfect ending to that chapter of my life!” – Annabelle of''Evergreen Lane''Wanderlust''“I have four different tattoos, and three of them are travel-related. My most recent one says “wanderlust,” and I got it when I was traveling in New Zealand. The travel theme is obvious, but it has an additional cool story behind it, too. It’s written in a “hobbit script” (Bilbo’s hand, to be specific) from the “Lord of the Rings” films, and was written out for me by Daniel Reeve, the guy who did all the calligraphy and map work in the “Lord of the Rings” and “Hobbit” movies. I asked him to design it for me, and then a few days later got it inked on in Wanaka, right above a compass tattoo I have on my forearm.” – Amanda of''A Dangerous Business''A Berber Symbol of Freedom''“After spending a transformative month traveling around Morocco in 2016 I memorialized my trip by getting a tattoo of a Berber symbol. The name for the symbol is yaz, which means free man. The motif is seen around Morocco and I was very attracted to its symmetry and meaning. I got the tattoo in red ink as red is the color of life for Berber people. It is also the color of resistance. It reminds me of the incredible people I’ve met during my three trips to Morocco, and especially the family I spent nearly two weeks with in the Sahara desert.” – Lola of''Miss Filatelista''His Name''“I traveled to Bali marking my first overseas visit when I was 26. This trip was special as I traveled alone to Bali from India while I didn’t even know what is an immigration form. I planned this trip mainly for two reasons, one this was my bachelorette trip and secondly because I wanted to celebrate my freedom before it would have gone (''generally in India there are so many things you can’t do once you are married!''). From boarding my first international carrier to understanding the literal meaning of green and red exit signs at the airport, every moment gave me a sense of liberation as I traveled Bali from one junction to the other. I made a companion at the very first day of my trip, my guide Su, that’s not his real name but a name that I gave him as his real name was nothing less than a tongue twister (''I never meant to be mean''). Su was part of my every adventure at Bali and heard about my courtship with my to be husband in depth enjoying every bit of it. He continued to ask me all these days what am I planning to buy for my boyfriend from Bali. This was indeed difficult to decide but soon I decided on something bold, liberal and an enduring gift. I had never mind to express my relationship in front of the world and maybe it was time to go all out. Next morning when I met Su, I surprised him by saying that, “''I want a tattoo as a gift for my boyfriend'',''I''want a tattoo on my wrist of his name''” Su, was pleasingly surprised with my idea and being a man who knows it all, he took me to his friend who was a tattoo designer.\xa0 I spent an hour in Nusa Dua at his parlor and got the desired tattoo. Now, I have a tattoo on my wrist which is not just a forever gift for my husband but a very doting memory of my first solo travel overseas.” – Mokshta of''Miss with Migratory Wings''The Continents''“My most recent travel tattoo was completed during a visit to San Diego, California. This was a celebratory getaway in honor of taking a leap of faith to follow my heart and my passion. I had decided to walk away from my former business, sell it, and start fresh at the age of 31 to do what I love most, travel. (taboo in todays culture) The dissolution agreement of my former company was completed right before this trip. I decided to place the 7 continents, in a very simple geometric form, on the back of my arm as a reminder that my “GOAL” is to visit all 7 and to successfully have travel become a pertinent part my life. It was that moment that the true GOAL Traveler was born.” – Cydny of''The GOAL Traveler''A Watercolor World''“I LOVE tattoos. Before I started traveling I had a couple, but as I traveled I began collecting them in different cities across the globe. Not necessarily a travel tattoo, but the one that was a catalyst to my travel journey is a tiny elephant that I have on my hand. Elephants are my spirit animal and every time I look at my hand I am reminded to be Wild and Free. Because of that, I packed my bags and left the country for 6 months. \xa04 Continents, 15 Countries, 6 Months.''One of the tattoos I got on my journey around the world was by the AMAZING and extremely talented Joel Alcalde at Stefano’s Tattoo Gallery in Lima, Peru. If you want an amazing watercolor or just an all around badass tattoo, he’s the man to see. He made my tattoo dreams come true\xa0and did a stunning watercolor map of the world on my forearm. It took 4 hours and I was dying from a pretty serious respiratory infection, but I hung tight and it was totally worth all of the pain, tears and exhaustion.''All of my tattoo experiences abroad have been amazing and I love that I get to carry the memories of my travels with me everyday, everywhere I go.” – Katie of''The Journey Within''A Wave''“I’d always thought about getting a tattoo overseas, but finally made it happen for my 29''th''birthday. I was spending two weeks in Nicaragua at a creative retreat. I had a few days in San Juan del Sur before moving on to Ometepe and walked past a tattoo shop a friend had recommended to see if he had any openings. The Canadian owner was watching Harry Potter, so it seemed like a good sign. I decided to get a wave, which had a few meanings. I don’t put that much stock into signs, but I’m a Cancer and have always felt connected to the water. Everywhere I’ve lived and loved has been near water, whether the ocean or river. And the wave also represents the peaks and valleys that happen in life. I put it on my inner arm as something just for me, not that everyone would see.” – Caroline of''Caroline in the City''It’s so much fun to learn about the tattoos that others get – representations of their journeys and what each step has meant to them.

There was a lot of information out there, but nothing that I knew I could trust, and nothing that just made it easy for me.''During my travels I realized how many misconceptions there were, and still are, about traveling alone. I initially thought it would be lonely, but it wasn’t. I worried it could be dangerous, but it wasn’t. I worried I’d run out of money, but I didn’t.''How did it all work out? It was so much to tell, and I knew that the process from just dreaming to actually doing could be daunting. I knew because I almost abandoned my dream to travel solo, too.''Now, five and a half years later, it feels more important than ever to spread the message that the world is not a scary place, that traveling solo is still amazing and accessible, and that it doesn’t have to be difficult, or reserved only for the especially rich or brave.''You can read more about it here.''Since the book first came out in 2015, thousands of women (literally thousands!) have benefitted from the advice in the pages that covers all of the following:''How to go from dreaming to doing:''Getting over the fear of traveling solo, with real, tangible exercises and methods to feel braver and more confident in your decision to go it alone.''How to deal with naysayers:''We all have them, it’s part of life!

This guide will help you plan a seamless trip there:''Getting There''Getting to Nusa Lembongan is fairly easy. Take a taxi (or Uber or Grab car) to Sanur and book a ticket for a boat. There is no main pier, and to get on all of these boats requires walking into the water up to your thighs. Depending on the ticket you book, it can include pickup at your accommodation in Bali and drop off in Lembongan. The staff will also take care of loading and unloading your baggage for you.''These are the options:''A local slow boat: This one leaves Sanur starting at around 8am (though public boats in Indonesia tend to just leave when full) and costs 60,000-100,000 Rupiah. The journey takes about an hour to 90 minutes and is the least comfortable and safe option.''Perama local boat: Leaves Sanur at 10:30 and costs 150k Rupiah and also takes 90 minutes to an hour though on a slightly larger and more comfortable boat.''Fast boats: A fast boat with four daily departures which includes pickup at your accommodation, a safer and faster boat, and a quicker journey of about 30 minutes. The cost is much higher, however, at 250k-300k Rupiah. The main options are either''Scoot''or''Rocky Fast Cruise''. I went with Rocky, simply showing up at the port 30 minutes before departure and buying a ticket in person, and was satisfied with the experience.''Things to do''Once on the island, it’s easy to get around by scooter or push bike. If on a scooter, you can easily drive around the whole island, with stops at the major attractions, in just one day. Most of the roads are good though the traffic in the main areas can get hectic. These are the best things to see on your journey:''Dream Beach''Dream Beach at 4:30, much nicer!''Dream Beach isn’t so dreamy midday, when the truckloads of day tourists from Bali go for a visit. The best times to see it are early in the morning or in the late afternoon after the crowds have gone home. There’s a restaurant with a pool right on the beach with a 50k entrance fee, or just enjoy the clean sand and the gorgeous blue water.''Devil’s Tear''The Devil’s Tear is a wave smashing up against a rock for quite the display when the swell is big and it’s high tide. At midday and sunset you’ll be sharing it with a lot of people, but the tides depend on the moon of course, and are always changing.''Be careful around the edges, as the waves come up quickly and powerfully. It’s quite the display of Mother Nature at her finest!''Also be forewarned, the road out to Dream Beach and Devil’s Tear isn’t great. It’s not impassable by any means but if it’s your first day on a motorbike you might not want to drive here until you’ve practiced a bit first.''Rock Pools''Dreamy''On the other side of Devil’s Tear, it’s really the rock pools that had me more impressed, reflecting the sun as it set in the sky. The waves can come up quickly on this side too, but the beauty of low tide at Devil’s Tear is it’s less likely to be a problem for these rock pools just behind the Devil’s Tear on the coastline.''Sandy Bay Beach''Next to the Devil’s Tear, an expensive but delicious restaurant''From the rock pools you can see this little cove with white sand and a nice restaurant right at the center. It’s closer to Western prices but it was also nice to have some food that reminded me of home for a change. I do love Indonesian food but sometimes a burger and fries sounds nice too!''Mushroom Beach''A few coves over is the popular Mushroom Beach. Much like Dream or Sandy Bay Beach, it’s another cove with restaurants and hotels all along it. Out of the three, pick your favorite and hang out for the evening or afternoon. To me, they were all quite similar.''Panorama Point''On the way back from the spots listed above, you can’t miss Panorama Point.\xa0It’s midway between Mushroom Beach and Jungut Batu Beach and provides a lovely view of the bay. The sunset would be slightly obstructed but still beautiful from there.''Jungut Batu Beach sunset''Loved these local kids playing in the water!''This is the beach you’ll be dropped off at when arriving from Bali. Chances are good this is also the beach you’re staying on during your Nusa Lembongan adventure and will therefore be the easiest spot to catch the sunset from.''Mangroves''The mangroves on Lembongan take up a large part of the northeast section of the island and are one of the main activities. A boat tour which lasts for about an hour departs from the end of the road and takes you through the mangroves and to a few snorkeling spots.''It’s easy to just show up and get on a boat. You’ll start to see signs for snorkeling trips as you drive closer to the end of the road, all offering more or less the same thing. Relax at one of the beach bars afterwards, many of which have swings over the water and quirky themes. It’s a quieter part of the island and a nice place to unwind. From there, the drive through the center of the island to Ceningan is quiet and pleasant. It was one of my highlights on the island with the jungly tree tunnels and butterflies flittering everywhere.''Yoga Shack''Morning Vinyasa''For a little exercise out of the water, I enjoyed the morning vinyasa at Yoga Shack. To suit the class to all levels, it was more stretching and less flow than I’m used to, but it turns out I’m pretty tight from just riding motorbikes and swimming so it was a welcome class for me! Drop-in classes run 100,000 IDR per class. You can''find the schedule here''.''Day trip to Nusa Ceningan''The Blue Lagoon on Nusa Ceningan''Between Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan, I actually liked Ceningan better! It was a bit more laid back and the water around most of the island was this dazzling baby blue color. It’s easy to reach by motorbike. Just head for the bridge and follow the signs on Lembongan. You can''read the full Ceningan itinerary here''.''Snorkeling and diving trips''All around Nusa Lembongan you’ll see signs advertising trips to snorkel with Manta Rays or dive the surrounding areas. Most of the trips actually take you over to Nusa Penida, so if you’ll be going anyways, save the trip for that island. If not, jump on a boat and get into the Manta action! There’s nothing quite like swimming with those majestic creatures.''Surf''Many surfers escape to the Nusa Islands to get surf without the crowds of Kuta or Canggu. The main spots are\xa0Playgrounds, Lacerations, and Shipwrecks, with a few good spots over on Nusa Ceningan as well.''Where to stay''There are a multitude of well-priced options on Nusa Lembongan, suiting just about every budget range. I thought the value for the money was incredible when it came to accommodation. I stayed at''Kawan’s Inn''which was fantastic in terms of the breakfast, coffee, location, friendly owners, and the value for the room. I had a king-sized bed, air conditioning, a nice bathroom, and my own private outside sitting area for 300k IDR (less than USD $22)!''Food-wise, the menu seems to be the same at just about every establishment on the island – pizza, burgers, sandwiches, pasta, and a small Indonesian menu. Your options are either Western food at a slightly cheaper price than you’d pay back home, or searching out a small warung to get some local fare for way less. I’d select a place based on the ambiance, the pool, and the view.''When to go''Any time is a good time to visit Nusa Lembongan although the rainy season in Bali is for real! Expect frequent showers from December through February. I visited the island in March and found the weather to be nice but the traffic and main streets to be hectic. I can imagine it’s a zoo in high season from May to October, so the shoulder seasons are probably best.''When visiting Nusa Lembongan, be sure to visit the other two islands as well – Penida and Ceningan. It’s easy to pop over to both for a day trip.''I’d also probably stay on Ceningan instead of Lembongan in the future. It was more beautiful, more laid back, and had more cool things to do. It’s just a quick scooter ride away from Lembongan, which makes it an easy day trip in either direction.''Pin me!''That said, Lembongan was a lovely place to lay my head for a couple of nights, and a nice taste of how Bali used to be.''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Siargao in the Philippines is a water-lover and general adventurer’s dream. A surfer’s paradise with a playful soul to it, it’s also a place that evolves a lot as one travels through it.''I spent about a week there, and while I could easily do a month, most of us can’t devote that much time to one place. With that in mind, what I did can be consolidated into just five days if you do an activity every day.''This itinerary begins in General Luna, which is where most people who visit Siargao end up staying. That said, I absolutely loved Pacifico up north, and included a night or two there at the end. It’s much smaller, much more laid back, and a lot quieter.''With this itinerary, you’ll see the best and most beautiful spots on Siargao:''Day One: Sugba Lagoon''In awe of this beauty''Sugba Lagoon is, no joke, what made me want to return to the Philippines. When I saw photos of it my jaw dropped and I was reminded of''Raja Ampat in Indonesia''.''While more crowded than Raja Ampat, which isn’t surprising considering this is just one lagoon and Raja Ampat is a large area with thousands of islands, it was a gorgeous way to spend a day and yes, the water really is that color:''Be sure to jump off the diving board at the lagoon and paddle around in the aquamarine water.''Not that high- dooo it!''I went on the tour with Kermit which included transport to and from General Luna, a stopover on an island nearby, which was almost as awesome as the lagoon itself. It also included a fresh seafood, fruit, chicken, and veggie lunch served on a banana leaf, drinks, and standup paddle boards. Total cost was 2000 pesos and it’s best booked at least a day in advance. I also recommend staying at''Kermit''while in General Luna. The food and the vibe are on point!''(By the way I paid out of pocket for the experience and nobody asked me to write a positive review. I just liked those guys!)''Day Two: Island Hopping''So many islands, so little time''Most island hopping excursions will take you to Naked, Daku, and Guyam Islands. You’ll see signs posted all over General Luna advertising the island hopping trips and all of them will take you to the same place. The difference will be the comfort, the lunch included, and the boat you take. I would recommend Kermit for this one too!''Naked Island is actually a sand bar with dazzlingly white sand and gorgeous turquoise water all around. This means you won’t have shade, so make sure that you bring ample sunscreen!''The other two islands do have some trees, and Daku Island has a little fishing village as well. All three have powdery white sand and gorgeous clear water. If you’re a surfer, you can also hire a boat to take you just out to Daku Reef for some nice and uncrowded surfing.''Day Three: Breakfast at Shaka and Sohoton Cove''The green bowl at Shaka, Yum!''While not actually on Siargao island itself, Sohoton Cove is one of the most loved things to do while visiting Siargao, though it does take several hours to get there, including a couple just in a boat. However it looks just as stunning, if not more-so, than Sugba Lagoon and includes a cave excursion as well.''I was dying to do this but sadly the trip didn’t have enough signups on the day that I wanted to go. I take this to mean that it’s not as crowded as some of the other options, so make this one a priority to sign up for early in your trip, either with Kermit or''Bravo''(also a good place to stay and eat!), or if you have enough people (8 or so) you can get your own boat over. There are plenty of signs in town for boat rentals.''Day Four: Learn to Surf''Cloud 9 surf area, just north of General Luna''Siargao is the surf capital of the Philippines and there’s a wave on the island for every level. The best part is plenty of the surf areas are uncrowded, especially if you’re willing to hire a boat to take you out past the reefs or to one of the islands mentioned above.''If you want to take a lesson, the guys at Kermit are great. You can also wander around General Luna and pop into the surf shops and go for one that you jive with. If you don’t want to take a lesson and just want to rent a board, check out Fat Lips in General Luna or head north to Pacifico if you want even less crowded surf spots.''I’m not an expert surfer by any means but I do think it’s tons of fun. Based on conversations I had with others and some firsthand research, here are some of the best spots:''G1:''Where most beginner’s classes take place. It can be a bit crowded but it’s a nice long wave perfect for learning on.''Cloud 9:''One of the most popular surf spots though it’s a reef break and best for advanced surfers.''Daku Reef:''I heard great things about this one, including that the crowds are much smaller or nonexistent. This requires a boat ride and you can easily ask a local to take you out from the beach in General Luna.''Pansukian Reef:''Near Naked Island, this is another one that isn’t too crowded and well suited to intermediate surfers.''Pacifico:''Known for bigger waves. This break looked super powerful to me while I was there and is probably only for more advanced surfers.''Day Five: Magpupungko Rock Pools/Adventure to the North''No wonder this is so loved''One of the best things to do in Siargao is to just rent a motorbike and go for a drive. If you’re island hopping the other days, that really only leaves day five to explore on your own. Wake up early and make the most of it!''Be forewarned, most scooter and motorbike rentals in Siargao don’t come with a helmet. I was pretty resistant at first and finally accepted that’s just how it is if you want a pair of wheels when in Siargao. Rentals cost anywhere from 400 to 500 pesos per day, usually. You can refill the petrol on the side of the road whenever you see the red bottles lined up. It usually costs 50 pesos per bottle and two will fill up the tank.''First, check the''tide forecast''and head to Magpupungko Rock Pools during low tide. Entrance is only 50 pesos and it’s easy to reach, so I’m of the opinion that a tour is not necessary.''So lovely''Initially, it’ll look crowded, but explore beyond the main pool and you’ll find little sections that aren’t as packed. The beach is also a lovely place to chill and eat lunch or buy a coconut (or three if you’re like me).''NOTE: There’s a lot of theft at the pools. I highly recommend putting your things in a dry bag and taking them with you to enjoy the pools fully. Never leave anything of value in the motorbike seat.''You’ll find these coconut tree forests everywhere''As you head north, you’ll pass by mangroves as well as Pacifico Beach, followed by Alegria Beach, finishing with the sunset at Santa Monica Pier. From there it’s only a 20km ride back to Pacifico Beach, where I recommend staying for the night (''Jafe’s''is awesome and quirky).''Things to Know''Book ahead:''In high season, expect things like accommodation, tours, and motorbikes to be booked out, and try to book ahead!''Cash:''I wish I’d known before I landed in Siargao that there aren’t any ATMs on the island that will take foreign cards. I got past this by downloading the World Remit app and sending myself money, then picking it up at the\xa0M Lhuillier in General Luna. It was pretty quick and easy and only cost $3.99 but it would have been''even easier''had I just brought ample cash with me from Cebu.''Pacifico:''I liked General Luna and Cloud 9, but I LOVED Pacifico. If you’re willing to wake up earlier to get south for some of the tours, consider staying there if you like a more laid back atmosphere like I do.''Refill your bottle:''I was so delighted to find that almost every restaurant and guesthouse in Siargo has a water tank and it’s free to refill your bottle! I don’t really like drinking out of the same plastic bottle over and over so if you have a refillable one, bring it with! There’s also the''SEA Movement''who actively go and clean the beaches and would certainly love to have you along. Due to these two things Siargao had some of the cleanest beaches I’ve seen in Southeast Asia.''Those are some of the best things to do when on Siargao, especially if you only have a few days.''Pin me!''Personally, I found leaving painful and plan to go back and explore more of Siargao Island, one of the most beautiful islands in the Philippines.''READ NEXT: Siquijor the Mystical Island in the Philippines''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Over the past few months I’ve been traveling alone again in Southeast Asia, completely winging it, not on any paid projects or assignments, and without any itineraries. It’s been a return to the root of my travels, and one that’s been amazingly enriching, leading me to some of my best adventures and most story-worthy experiences yet.''It’s also shown me a pattern. I notice it with other solo female travelers, too. Whenever I go start anew on fresh ground, the cycle starts again. It’s like there are seven distinct stages that I go through and then when it’s time to go somewhere new I rinse and repeat.''So for my fellow solo female travelers out there, how familiar does this sound?''One: A fish out of water''A lone wolf''Unless I have wisely booked myself into a social place, or somewhere with a built-in activity''like diving''or yoga, I will arrive into town without knowing anyone and usually staying in a private room, because I just can’t do dorms anymore.''The proverbial coin is in the air, will it land on, social place with cool people, or nobody around/all couples? Depending on which side it lands, it could mean spending day one alone.''This is when it gets very tempting to be a hermit. Suddenly the idea of going out to eat is petrifying, and even just walking around seems like an exhausting task because everything is new and confusing.''Is this going to be forever?''Sometimes it''feels like a low''. I will look at the girls with boyfriends with a bit of envy, and then I’ll remind myself that that was me from time to time before and I often just wanted that guy to evaporate. It’s not all roses having a travel buddy, especially a romantic one, I know that.''Two: Stepping out of the comfort zone''Step one usually lasts for a day, maybe two. Usually this inspires some kind of action, like going on an organized activity like an island hopping excursion,''getting on a dive boat'', going to a yoga class, if available, or just striking up a conversation with someone in the café next to me.''At this point I stay off my phone, because I want to be approachable. Besides, there is nothing on social media that’s going to make me feel less lonely.''In this vulnerable position, pushed to be more talkative, this is where the beauty of solo travel shines through, it makes us more approachable because we’re alone, and it makes us more interested in approaching others, for the same reason.''It’s usually a 50-50 split between someone coming up and approaching me, or me approaching someone. This is such a magical moment, because this is often the person who I will have adventures with.''Three: Finding a friend/tribe''No longer alone''The next step is pretty easy, it’s just a matter of,''what are you up to today? I am doing this, would you like to join?''And then before you know it, you have a built-in adventure buddy.''Maybe it’s not the first person you talk to, maybe that person happens to be taking off that afternoon,''drat!''But it will probably be the second, or maybe the third person.''I tend to get more motivated with each nice conversation.''Four: Cloud nine''This is the time when I LOVE solo traveling''Cloud nine is that beautiful moment when I thank my lucky stars that I’m traveling solo. Something wonderful will have happened, like I got invited by a local to do something really cool, or I''met up with another solo traveler''who I would not have been motivated to talk to otherwise, or I will have joined a group who I feel amazing with,''like in Mozambique''.''This is the real gift of solo travel, when I have an experience that I just know I wouldn’t have chased without having to step out of my comfort zone a little bit. This is when it feels like all the birds are singing with me and everyone I see is smiling at me. It feels so good and so connected.''At this point I have forgotten all about step one, and I even feel grateful for it, because knowing to trust in those moments that things like this were on their way is what keeps the solo journey so beautiful.''Five: Wanting ‘me’ time again''Alone again is good, too.''Next a pretty funny thing starts to happen. Even though I am so happy being social, I start to crave my alone time again.''I start to build it into my schedule, maybe it’s just an hour here or there and then eventually when it’s time to be completely alone again, I will commit to and even crave it, as long as it doesn’t last for too long!''Six: Gearing up to say goodbye''There will be another travel buddy, though it’s hard to say goodbye''This is usually the point in the trip when I have to say goodbye to someone. Either they are leaving or I am and maybe I still have other friends around so it’s OK, or maybe I know that I’m going to start all over again. Do I cancel another plan and stay for longer? Do I make the silent promise to myself, like I always do, that I will return? Nine times out of 10 I do the latter, and in the moment I truly believe that I will make good on that promise. But I almost never do.''The world is big and my list is never-ending and there’s always another adventure on the horizon.''Seven: Tasting the bittersweetness of leaving, and preparing for it to start all over again''Time to go it alone again''Finally the time comes to go, and I always feel a bit of a pit in my stomach in those places that are really nourishing to me, full of amazing stories and people. Which lately is almost everywhere.''But then I remember that the trust that I went into it with in the beginning is exactly what led me to the present, so it’s time to start it all over again, to trust again, to know that the loneliness will hit, and then it will pass, and that it will all be part of the dance of solo traveling, the greatest high and the most generous gift I’ve found\xa0yet.''Pin me!''The highs are worth the lows.''My fellow solo travelers, did this sound familiar to you?''Solo traveling for the first time? Get THE guidebook for solo female travelers here!''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''“Sa Bai Dee!”''This Laotian greeting still echoes in my ears every now and then. Laos is a special place in my heart – it is where I cruised down a beautiful river on a tube, where I fell in love, and where I realized how much I’ve changed in 5 years as a traveler.''I loved the dramatic mountains, the lush jungles, the friendly people, and the laid back vibe. I figured it’s time for me to put together an epic itinerary for you with the best things to do in Laos, starting from the south to the north (which is what I did, but it can be easily reversed!):''Don Det (4000 Islands)''When you first enter Laos, you’ll quickly realize that everything slows down. Time seems to have lost its meaning there, and it is especially apparent in Don Det, a hippie heaven just north of the Cambodian border.''Southern Laos receives far fewer travelers than its fast growing Northern side, and most travelers here are found lazing in a hammock outside of modest bungalows built by the river, soaking in silence. It’s the perfect start to your Laos journey!''Some may say that there’s not much to do in Don Det,''but that’s not true''. You can go for kayaking trips that take off daily in the morning, rent a bicycle and get lost in the villages, head to Don Khong to check out the waterfalls, and of course, tube your way down the Mekong River with new friends you’ve just met. It is also home to the stunning Li Phi Waterfalls! I loved Don Det, in fact I’d say that it was my favorite place in Laos.''Pakse''From Don Det, take a 3-hour bus to Pakse, the biggest southern city and a major transport hub in Laos. You are likely to arrive in Pakse in the afternoon, so it’s best to spend the rest of the day relaxing, sorting out a motorbike rental, and getting ready for an incredible adventure in the Bolaven Plateau.''Bolaven Plateau''If you are looking some some off the beaten path adventures in Laos, consider doing the multi-day''motorcycle loop around the Bolaven Plateau''. The scenery blew me away with\xa0lush and beautiful plants, giant butterflies, and ample waterfalls (I saw a total of 5 but there were so many more!). It’s best done in a group, but it is also completely possible to do it solo, as long as you are confident and comfortable on a motorbike.''Wat Phu''Also just on the outskirts of Pakse, Wat Phu is an impressive Khmer temple that reminds me of a miniature version of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, though it was actually built in the 7th century, way before Angkor Wat.''Wat Phu does not see as many tourists, though, so it’s a nice change of atmosphere. This will make a nice day trip from Pakse, just make sure to pile on sunscreen as there’s very little shade!''Vientiane''The capital of Laos is surprisingly quiet and laid-back. There’s honestly not a ton to do in Vientiane, though if you’re heading to Thailand after and want to spend more than 30 days there, it’s the perfect place to sort out your 60-day visa. There are a few temples worth checking out, such as the golden Pha That Luang, and the Wat Si Saket.''There’s also a''mural in a hostel''there painted by yours truly. Check it out!''Vang Vieng''Tranquility is back in Vang Vieng, now that rules and regulations are imposed on the once deadly (no kidding, as more than 20 people died from drowning, jumping into shallow waters, and drug overdose every year) tubing that was notoriously popular among backpackers. There are now more group travelers, which has resulted in bigger hotels and restaurants.''What this all means is that the river is now less occupied, and the rural, off-beat places that group tours never go are available for discovery. Here are a few things to do when you are here:''Tubing or Kayaking''It is a unique way to spend your day, and you can still take beer along with you while taking in the scenery as you float.''Rent a tube, grab a beer, go alone or with a few people, and let the river take you from the top of the river to town. If you want to make it active, consider kayaking instead of tubing. There are still a few stops along the way, including a popular Irish bar. If you want to avoid the crowds, consider going in the early morning. The weather would be much more forgiving, too. Leave all of your valuable belongings behind, or bring a dry bag with you. I’d bring just a GoPro and some loose change!''Rock Climbing''Vang Vieng is a great place to rock climb, whether you are a first-timer or an experienced climber. This area and others around it are getting more and more popular with the climbing community.''Biking''Rent a motorbike or a bicycle and get out of town. You will be surrounded by lush greens, beautiful rice paddy fields, and quiet villages within minutes. Check out the Tham Phu Kham Cave and Blue Lagoon on your journey. Both are gorgeous!''Luang Prabang''From Vang Vieng, take a bus to Luang Prabang, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is a highlight of Laos for many travelers, and a lot of people end up staying longer than intended, so leave room for serendipity:''Kuang Si Waterfalls''An icon just outside the city, Kuang Si Waterfalls are stunning and SO worth seeing it in person (the water really is''that''blue!). If you are fairly confident and comfortable on a motorbike, you could rent one and get there on your own.''Minivans and Tuk-Tuks are also available to take you there. From the entrance, it is a small hike up to the waterfalls that will take you past rescued black bears hanging out at the sanctuary. It will only be a few minutes before you start hearing the water. The area is packed with tourists for most of the day, so consider going early in the morning and try to be the first person in if you want to avoid the crowds. To get a panoramic view of the waterfalls from high up, continue your hike to the (not so) secret waterfalls.''Midnight Bowling''While the strict 11pm curfew is imposed on all businesses (everything shuts down at 11:30pm), curiously, a bowling alley is open all night. It’s where everyone goes when everything else shuts down for the night. The bowling alley is a fun place to hang out and meet fellow travelers if you’re feeling the party vibe.''Pousi Hill''This is Pousibily (see what I did there?!) the best spot in Luang Prabang for sunset. It’s a leisure hike up with a temple on the top of the mountain. While you will have to share the spot with others, the 360 degree view of Luang Prabang and the beautiful Mekong River is worth the squeeze.''Nong Khiaw''Take a 4-hour bus ride from Luang Prabang to Nong Khiaw, a small town with quite literally nothing to do. It is a\xa0quiet, laid back village that’s perfect for relaxing. In low season, a spacious bungalow next to the river could cost as low as $3. You can also take a 3-4 hour walk to one of the 3 smaller villages close by and spend a night at a local homestay, and experience the true Laotian village life.''Huay Xai''This could be a nice ending to your Laos journey, before taking a 2-day boat to northern Thailand (or if you are coming from Thailand using this method, Huay Xai will be your very first stop in Laos!). A popular activity to do in Huay Xai is''The Gibbon Experience'', where you get to spend a few days zip-lining in the jungle, with an opportunity to stay in a treehouse and witnessing the gibbons in their natural habitat. To be honest I didn’t try it, but everyone I met who did gave it rave reviews.''It is a wonderful way to spend some time with nature and contribute to forest preservation at the same time.''Pin me!''I hope these tips helped you to plan a Laos itinerary with some of the well-loved spots, and a few under the radar ones.

For the first ten years of my life, I lived a conservative lifestyle centered around family and church. I attended a military-style Catholic school, where all the teachers were nuns. The nuns, ironically, were merciless and enforced order through spanking. Outside of school, I served as a flower girl at lots of weddings and went around the neighborhood picking tropical fruits.''One day, my mom miraculously won a visa lottery to America and was granted a green card. In 2001, my family moved to Los Angeles, where I experienced a major culture shock. I was surprised that my 5th grade classmates had boyfriends and wore nail polish. At my school in Nigeria, wearing nail polish was a serious offence that would get you at least 25 lashes. Having a boyfriend at 10 was unthinkable.''I couldn’t connect with my new classmates. Most of the time, I had no idea what they were talking about. During my first Halloween, one girl excitedly asked me if I was going trick-or-treating. ‘Trick-o-what?’ I asked. Unable to make friends, I quickly developed depression. Being a perfectionist and collecting accolades became my primary coping mechanisms. Throughout grade school, I put my head down and focused on being a top student. I hoped that I would find happiness one day.''As a young adult, life threw some curveballs at me. I applied to over 200 jobs after college and was rejected by all of them. When I finally found a job, I was let go after three weeks. My next job lasted 4 weeks. Feeling like a complete failure, I succumbed to severe depression. The silver lining is that the experience forced me to rethink my values. I stopped focusing on collecting accolades and impressing people. Rather, I started''focusing on self-care and happiness''. After working for a year as an AmeriCorps volunteer in Washington DC, I moved back to my beloved Spain to teach English.''What motivated you to travel alone for the first time?''My parents, who are strict about education, wanted me to be a doctor. When I got to college I realized that medicine wasn’t for me. Instead, I studied international relations and took advantage of travel programs offered by my school. It was during an internship in China that I discovered the euphoria of travel. I went to the Great Wall and was completely blown away. Being black in China, I was almost like a celebrity. People would point, stare, and ask me for pictures every single day. It was flattering and irritating at the same time.''After my experience in China, I made travel a priority, studying abroad in Spain and exploring America.''I traveled alone for the first time in 2015 when I moved to Spain to teach English. Craving adventure and longing to return to Spain, I booked a one-way ticket to Madrid. I wanted to see the world and''didn’t want to wait for people anymore''. Once I arrived in Madrid, I found an apartment within a week and settled in. With Madrid as my home base, I traveled solo throughout Europe for almost a year.''How did you persuade your parents of your lifestyle choice?''My family is actually very supportive of my current lifestyle. Living in America has made my parents gradually become more open to non-traditional lifestyles. My mom is currently helping me reach out to different Nigerian groups in LA to promote my blog. At the end of the day,''she truly wants me to be happy''and will put aside ideology if necessary.''I think the key factor in convincing my parents about my new path was having a plan. Nigerians don’t like uncertainty so I’ve had to demonstrate the concrete steps I plan to take and the outcomes. I did a ton of research and took several courses about''the business of travel blogging''. I attended business seminars. Recently, I hired a business coach to develop a road map for my blog. Doing those things sent the message that I was serious. It assured my parents that blogging wasn’t some fluffy hobby.''Have you ever faced any challenges traveling alone as a woman of color?''While traveling solo in Dubrovnik, Croatia, I was stalked by a middle-aged man who said he liked ‘dark-skinned ladies.’ He followed me around for two days and even showed up next to my hostel! As a woman of color, I have to be careful when traveling to places that don’t receive many black tourists. People there may find me exotic and prey on me if they see that I’m alone.''I’ve experienced racism on many occasions while traveling, especially in Spain. I was denied service at a tapas bar in Valencia. The waiter gave me a dirty stare and went on to serve other people. I try not to dwell on such experiences because I know there are people with prejudices everywhere. Instead, I focus on what led me to visit the place, whether it be food, art, beautiful scenery, or a number of other things.''My travel experiences have been overwhelming positive. In Japan, for instance, a stranger walked me to my hostel when I was wandering around lost. In Paris, a Danish man bought me a train ticket when I was trying to figure out how to work the machine. I’ve experienced far more kindness than hostility.''Solo travel has shown me that''.''What’s your best advice to other women of color who want to travel alone?''Just do it! I was scared out of my mind the first time, but solo travel has truly transformed my life. I have developed so much confidence in myself. It was almost as my biggest anxieties and self-limiting beliefs vanished overnight. I’ve been so empowered that I quit my job and started my own business!''Traveling alone can help you become a stronger version of yourself''. You don’t know what you’re capable of until you try. I used to think that I was useless at finding directions, but''I navigated my way around the Mediterranean''for 22 days. Don’t let fear or doubt stop you from seeing the world.''Where have you been that you think is perfect for solo female travelers?''Galicia, Spain is an underrated place that is perfect for solo female travelers. Located on the northern coast of Spain, the region is home to beautiful beaches, vast flower fields, and the best seafood I’ve ever had. Santiago de Compostela, the last stop of the famous Camino de Santiago, has an entire street, Rua Franco, just dedicated to seafood. If you’re not into seafood, you can find lots of other Spanish dishes and vegetarian options. Also visit the Tower of Hercules, just about away in the city of A Coruna. The wind is intense there so be careful. You can get some amazing pictures with the tower and the flower fields in the background.''What are some obstacles you’ve had to overcome in order to make traveling a lifestyle?''The biggest obstacle I’ve had to overcome is going against Nigerian tradition. Nigerians typically choose careers in medicine, engineering, law, or academia. My dad is a doctor and my mom is a professor. My older brother is also a doctor. I was supposed to pursue medicine but quit after one semester of pre-med. Even after giving up on medicine, I still felt the pressure to choose a ‘serious’ career.''Travel blogging''isn’t something most people would consider a serious career. Most people don’t understand''how travel bloggers can make money''. I’ve had to convince my parents that blogging is in fact a viable career choice. Not only that, but I’ve also had to convince myself.''Pursuing this path was quite scary'', but sitting in an office for 9 hours is scarier.''In addition to that, I’ve had to be creative to fund my travels. I took a 3-day trip to Budapest and paid 186 euros total. To afford this travel lifestyle, I’ve had to master the art of travel hacking. I’ve also had to cut back on spending in other areas. It requires discipline, which I learned back at my elementary school in Nigeria.''How did Be My Travel Muse help you?''Get the Guidebook for Solo Female Travelers!''Be My Travel Muse encouraged me when I had doubts about traveling alone. I would read the stories of other female solo travelers and feel more at ease. I could relate to a lot of their doubts and fears. It was also great to find''a community of travelers''with the same fervor to see the world.''***''Wow, what an incredible story.

There’s a feeling of eeriness and intrigue to it, and to visit without connecting a bit to the spiritual side of the island would be missing out on what makes Siquijor so enchanting.''As well as the waterfalls, the beautiful corals, the caves, the big tree, and the white sand beaches.''So this guide has a little bit of both. Departing from the ferry terminal, these are some of the best experiences and Siquijor tourist spots in order:''Paliton Beach''Lovely Paliton''Paliton is easily Siquijor’s most famous beach, and if you’re staying in San Juan like most visitors, you won’t be too far from here.''The beach’s most famous and striking feature is the line of coconut palms along the beach. It’s also famous for snorkeling and its lovely white sand. Even during high season, it isn’t very crowded. Make sure to explore beyond just the area near where you park. You’ll need to round a few bends on foot towards your right, if facing the water, to find these trees.''Pro tip: Check out the timing of the tides before you go and try to go during high tide. There are sea urchins and jellyfish in the grasses which will make it a bit of a minefield during low tide.''San Juan''San Juan''San Juan is where you’ll find most of the guesthouses, resorts, dive shops, restaurants, and bars. It’s where almost everyone stays when they visit Siquijor for two big reasons: It’s west-facing so you get a fantastic sunset, and it has white sand beaches.''Take a walk in any direction around 5pm and watch as golden hour unfolds into a fiery sunset with Negros and Apo Island in the distance.''Century Old Balete Tree''An enchanted tree''This ‘century old’ tree is actually closer to 400 years old, and is so much more than meets the eye. Once a spot for sacred rituals, the spring under the tree is now a fish spa and love potion vendor, mostly to attract visitors to what would otherwise just be something most people pass right on by without realizing the significance of this tree to Siquijor.''Noel told me that the fairy who was previously in charge of the tree was angry. Periodically, children would go missing around the area and then show up days later, having been taken into the spirit world by the tree. These days there’s a new chief fairy in town – Louie – who is a bit more benevolent.''Whether this all sounds like hocus pocus or not, one thing was undeniable to me as I edited this photo – parts of it looked like they’d been oddly misplaced, disappeared, or airbrushed in, even though it was .RAW straight from the camera. I’m still a bit confused but I’m chalking it up to Louie’s antics. I hope this photo did him proud in the end.''Lagaan Falls''Small and not too crowded''Noel laughed and asked what I thought of Lagaan, expecting that I would have been underwhelmed, when I told him it’s the first place I visited in Siquijor.''I actually loved it! It’s not as big or popular as some of the other waterfalls, but that also makes it a lot less crowded. There’s a rope swing, a natural ‘slide’ (which you can see behind me in the photo above), some cool caves behind the water’s veil, and a little climb-through. It costs 50 pesos to visit plus 10 to park the bike. A bit rich considering Cambugahay is only 10 pesos but still, we’re only talking about a dollar.''Cambugahay Falls''Soooo dreamy. A must-see!''Cambugahay is a three-tiered waterfall with three large lagoons. The aquamarine color, the refreshing water temperature on a hot day, and the way the falls gently cascade over caves and light brown rocks make it clear why this is the most popular spot on the island. It’s just as magical as Siquijor itself.''This was at 11am, so I had to share with plenty of others, but I do love that kid swashbuckling in the background!''There are rope swings and platforms to chill on as well as bamboo rafts on each level of the falls. There’s also plenty of room for swimming, though you’ll have to share it with a lot of people unless you’re strategic with your timing. I visited twice, once around 11am and once at 7am, and I’m sure you can guess when I had the better experience. There was almost nobody else when I went early. Having these waterfalls all to yourself is a treat and a half!''I highly recommend the kinilaw or tuna sisig for lunch at El Monte in Lazi afterwards. I’m still dreaming of it.\xa0Say hi to the (now) infamous Noel if he’s there wearing his cowboy hat.''Driving and Mangroves''I mean, I thought they were cool!''Part of the joy of Siquijor is driving a motorbike through it. The roads are mostly smooth and nice to drive on and there’s hardly any traffic. The few cars and motorbikes I did encounter were conscientious, a nice contrast to the somewhat stressful roads and rude big trucks on''Lombok''the week before.''Even if you’ve never driven a motorbike before, Siquijor is a good place to learn. Rentals run at 350 pesos per day including a helmet. Anything higher is a tourist price and you can haggle it down.\xa0You can rent them in San Juan, Lazi, or directly from the port.''Pictured above are some mangroves along the 15-minute drive from Lazi, where the falls were, to the next spot, Salagdoong Beach. Noel was surprised I was that excited about a bunch of mangroves but as he demonstrated with his lack of enthusiasm about Lagaan Falls, it obviously takes a lot to impress him.''Salagdoong Beach and Cliff Jump''DOOOO it!''Salagdoong Beach is another fan favorite and while not as gorgeous as the beaches of San Juan, it has two cliff jumps, one that’s 20 feet (6 meters) and one that’s 35 feet (11 meters) high, depending on the tide of course.''I did them both and the taller one is definitely more fun! Just run and leap instead of peering over and trying to decide whether you want to do it or not. I wouldn’t have been able to if I hadn’t just hurled myself over without thinking about it too much.''The jump and beach are part of a resort. Entrance is 60 pesos with a compulsory Red Cross donation included.''Seek a Healer''There’s magic afoot''As mentioned in the intro, Siquijor is full of healers and witches. Want to cast a curse on someone? Siquijor is your place. Want to obtain a love potion? Look no further.''If you want this experience, the first thing to do is talk to a local if you can. See if you can get him or her to bring you to someone legitimate. Noel’s cousin is a healer, and I kindly asked him to help me with an illness I was suffering from. After placing two crystals in a glass of water and chanting over them and the crown of my head, he told me to drink, and to believe. That last part was important. Sadly I still needed another round of antibiotics afterwards but it was still a cool experience.''I spoke with another traveler who did a smoke clearing ritual in the middle of the island with a folk healer, which he gave me a moderately excited review of. You can find them''here''if it interests you.''Apo Island''Sea turtle heaven''Apo Island is the hotspot if you’re into sea turtles. It’s also home to gorgeous corals and over 650 species of fish. You’ll find plenty of dive shops in San Juan that will happily take you out on a day trip, or you can actually stay on the island and the cost of dives drops considerably.''Stay''Most people stay in San Juan when they visit Siquijor, though I think it’s best broken up into two areas, adding in Lazi. There’s a range of options depending on your budget on Siquijor, though I can highly recommend''Xylla guesthouse''for a nice clean place to stay in Lazi and''Glamping Siquijor''(pictured in the star photo above) for San Juan. Both are easy on the budget and a nice value for a private room on the island.''You can''get $25 off your booking at both on booking.com with this coupon''.''I hope this guide helped you to connect not only with the beautiful places in Siquijor, but the mystical side of the island as well. It has a soul to it that you just can’t get to know unless you go digging a little deeper. All of the spots mentioned above are included in this Google Map for your reference:''On a personal note, I also absolutely adored the local friendliness. Kids were always saying hi, as were the adults, smiling big, genuine smiles and calling out warm greetings. It’s hard not to fall in love with a place like that, isn’t it?''Pin me!''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''READ NEXT: The Perfect Philippines Itinerary''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''5 Days on Siargao Island, Philippines''Bantayan Island: A Hidden Gem In The Philippines''Where to Go in The Philippines: The Perfect Itinerary''I remember that afternoon in my Berlin apartment expressing to a friend of mine, who also doesn’t drink, that I was afraid of going back to Southeast Asia as a solo traveler without being a drinker anymore.''It had been three years since I’d been back and I remembered it as quite the party place. I tended to bond with people over Chang beers and in backpacker bars. So many of the activities involved alcohol, and I was afraid that I’d be the only non-drinker there.''He smiled and suggested that the reason why I’d thought of Southeast Asia as such a party place before is because that was the mode I was in at the time.''“You’ll find the other non drinkers because this time, you’ll be looking for them and they’ll be looking for you.”''I was skeptical, but he’d turn out to be right, and this decision would lead me to the best travel experiences of my life.''Why no alcohol?''Abridging it, on the spiritual journey I’ve been on over the past few years, I’ve been taking a harder look at the things that have kept me from being happy and at peace. Hangovers always gave me anxiety, and when I asked myself what positive contribution alcohol made to my life, I couldn’t think of anything.''Not one thing.''That made the decision clear, though taking action hasn’t always been easy. I promise to talk more about that later, but for now, I just want to share the experience in Southeast Asia, and why it was so worth it:''A different kind of approach''Upon arriving back in Thailand I headed straight for a Vipassana retreat in Chiang Rai. I’d''done it once before''and found it amazingly invigorating.''That meant five days (the usual is ten but this one was shorter) of complete silence, meditating all waking hours of the day. I turned off my technology, didn’t read, rarely wrote, and focused on being mindful. I emerged from that recharged, and empowered in my decision to do this trip sober.''At the retreat center, New Life Foundation in Chiang Rai''This set the tone for a much healthier month to follow, spent adventuring around''Thailand’s hidden places''in a car I’d rented with my assistant, Ashley, and my''adventure tour partner, Pete''. We never went to any backpacker places and alcohol never came up on the trip. We were simply too busy having adventures!''I loved this healthier approach. I saw 28 out of 31 sunrises that month, was surrounded by friendly Thai people in more remote places, and otherwise, was at a retreat where everyone else was sober too. I was surrounded by spiritual and intentional people and that made it easy and enriching.''Sunrise #20''I knew that I had it easy. I didn’t have to work at being social with anyone since I already had a built in network. However that was about to change. In the solo months that followed in Indonesia I prepared myself for more challenges.''Feeling like an island''Upon arriving in Indonesia, I was on my own again. It wasn’t a huge deal since I joined a''dive boat in Raja Ampat''right away. I was the only non-drinker on board and I did get asked why I wasn’t drinking, but I’m pretty used to that now. A nice glass of wine, a beer to close out the day, or a shot of sake are ingrained in our respective cultures. It’s considered strange to abstain, though on the other side of it I wish more people would give it a try. I didn’t say that though, I just said that I like life better this way, and people were usually satisfied with that.''Thankfully nobody was getting wasted on board anyways, because the point of the trip was diving. I had a great time and this trip ranks in the top 5 of my life.''Was the only non drinker at the beach party but it didn’t matter!''After that, I landed in Lombok and went straight to''Kuta''. That’s where it sank in that I was alone and my former methods for meeting people – dorms and drinking – were on the table for what felt like everyone but me. I went to a few bars with people from my guesthouse, but it just didn’t feel right. I felt like an island in a sea of people who had different objectives than I did. I was trying to fit into a place I’d intentionally decided to part with. I had a couple of lonely days, but thankfully it didn’t last for long.''The people I met''It didn’t take long for me to realize I’d just been looking in the wrong places. I had to go out with more intention. So I went to a yoga class, and struck up a conversation with someone who looked interesting in a coffee shop in Kuta. He turned out to be an amazing adventure buddy for the next few days there – a spiritual person who also just wanted to experience the nature and beauty of Lombok.''Next, I went to the Philippines and on my first day in Siquijor, met a local who also meditates regularly and seeks spirituality. We sang karaoke and swam in waterfalls in the days that followed. I had amazing trip there, too, and as I sit here writing this, I can’t wait to see what the rest of the month of March brings. My trip isn’t over yet!''Mermaiding in Indonesia''I don’t believe that it’s by chance that I was led to these people, and them to me.''I realized that by trusting, by being open, and by focusing on meeting the kind of people who I want to be meeting, I put myself in situations where it’s more likely to happen, and the chances increased.''I also had an amazingly productive three months, both on this blog and in my travels. I had so much more time on my hands, and to entertain myself, I couldn’t just fall back on happy hour drinks, I had to go out and experience something. It’s just not possible to see as much as I saw when sleeping off a hangover or drinking afternoon beers instead of afternoon exploration.''The sunrises were somehow brighter. I noticed more things. I was in the moment so much more, and my mind was sharp. Every morning that I woke up feeling good, I knew I had made the right choice.''It’s my hope that by sharing this story it shows that it’s possible to have an amazing travel experience without the crutch of alcohol or drugs. I’m not here to try to convince anyone of anything, or to demonize anyone’s lifestyle choices.''But maybe someone who reads this today will see exactly what they need to right now. If that’s you, I hope you know that better adventures await you than ever did before.''Pin me!''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Lombok is, in a word, enchanting.''This island next to Bali receives far fewer visitors and yet it’s equally, if not even more, beautiful than its famous neighbor.''During my time there I visited six different waterfalls, more beaches than I can count, most of which I had all to myself, and climbed the amazing Rinjani volcano, finishing with a trip to the Gili islands.''In full disclosure these travel experiences were split up over several visits to this island (because I can’t get enough) though my itinerary can easily be replicated in one weeklong trip. Though if you can stay for longer, do yourself a favor and give it more time! I could spend months on this island alone, finding hidden coves around every''Jurassic Park''-like curve and bend.''This guide begins in Kuta, Lombok where most people head first. It’s quick and easy to reach from the airport and has plenty of accommodation options and gorgeous beaches. From there we’ll move north to the waterfalls, rice fields, and Rinjani, finishing with the Gilis. If you’re coming from the other direction, you can easily reverse it to suit your needs:''Kuta''That water!''This laid back surfer town is the perfect introduction to Lombok. It’s a nice mix of yoga, Western and Indonesian food, and plenty of other travelers to meet. It’s also the jumping off point for exploration of the southern beaches on Lombok, which are some of the best in Indonesia for waves, by the way.''I also loved that most of them didn’t have anyone else around. I could have a private beach all to myself, without a resort in front of it, without having to pay a huge fee, without having to worry about much of anything, at all.''These were the best ones, most of which are easy to reach by motorbike. One could spend a day at each beach, but if you’re pressed for time, you could split the following up into two days:''Pantai Mawun'': A beach famous for its beauty, with beach chairs and umbrellas and fresh seafood and coconuts served on the beach.''Pantai Tampah:''This was one of my favorites. There wasn’t anyone else around and the beach is cleaned regularly, and it doesn’t allow anyone to sell you anything while you’re there (which is untrue for the Kuta and Mawun where you’ll be asked to buy bracelets on the regular).''Pantai Lancing:''Right next to Tampah, Lancing is equally clean and peaceful and even has a swing on the sand! If you’re visiting Tampah, might as well walk to your right (if facing the ocean) and visit Lancing too.''Pantai Semeti and Telawas:''Amazing for sunset!''Most of the southern beaches won’t have a sunset view, but Semeti does! It’s also one of the most unique beaches I found, with lava rock formations that are unlike anything else on Lombok. I had so much fun climbing all over them and exploring while waiting for the sun to set. The road is terrible, but if you’re confident on a motorbike, don’t miss this one!''Batu Puyung:''This ‘umbrella’ shaped rock is close to Bukit Merese, the famous sunset point near Kuta. You can reach it by taking a boat ride over from the shore near Bukit Merese, or you can walk (I chose the latter). The walk takes about an hour but it goes along tide pools and over rocks, plus almost nobody chooses that route so it’s nice and quiet, too.''Bukit Merese:''This hill is''the''spot for sunsets near Kuta, but I’d suggest going at any time of day. It’s absolutely stunning in every direction and there are strands of sand running under the bluffs that almost nobody bothers to visit, though they should!''Pantai Nambung:''That rock in front of me turns into a waterfall!''I’m hesitant to include this, mostly because tourists are regularly robbed there and it’s tough to find. However it’s also very cool to see on a day with big waves, when the tide is in, because the waves rush over the rock to create a glorious, gushing waterfall. I tried over and over to get the shot with the wave, and I swear each time I put the camera down that’s when the wave would come. It felt like Mother Nature was telling me to just go play, so I did. If you visit this area, it’s best to take a guide, which I don’t often advocate but in this case I would. (a local pulled a machete on my friend and I though we were able to talk him down. It wouldn’t happen with a local guide.)''For more info on each of the beaches and photos of each, plus where to eat and do yoga, read my''Kuta, Lombok guide.''Benang Stokel and Benang Kelambu Waterfalls''Heading north, next we’ll enter the lands of rice fields and waterfalls.''On the way up from Kuta, I recommend taking any little side road that strikes your fancy once you reach the rice fields (just make sure you know how to retrace your steps). This part of the island is full of cascading rice paddies where the farmers still use traditional methods to farm the rice, with water buffalo and their own two hands.''Watch the video for more:''From there, head north to the Benang Stokel and Benang Kelambu Falls. There are actually five waterfalls in the area, though the two mentioned are the most impressive ones. If you’re on a time crunch, you’ll probably just want to do those two.''Both are fairly easy to access and don’t require a lot of climbing. The path is either paved, stairs, or dirt. Upon arriving, you’ll be ushered into an office at the start of the trails to book a guide and pay the fees. My understanding is this is required. I paid 125,000 IDR to visit the waterfalls mentioned.''First you’ll come to a bridge where you can jump off of the top of the first small waterfall into the river below. From there you can see\xa0Benang Stokel through the trees – a twin set of waterfalls:''My first waterfall on Lombok. Love!''Next you’ll walk for another 15 minutes or so to the most famous waterfall in the area, Benang Kelambu. I noticed plenty of stalls next to the path, most of which were closed when I went (February – during rainy season). My understanding is on the weekends, especially on Sundays, and after Ramadan, the place is absolutely packed with locals. Avoid those times if possible.''How could this even be real?''I got lucky and got them almost all to myself.''The road to the waterfalls is well-marked. Consult''this map''for the coordinates (plus all the other places mentioned in this post).''Tiu Kelep Waterfall''So dreamy!''Next is the waterfall that made me want to come back to Lombok: Tiu Kelep.''When I first visited 5 years ago, nobody was talking about this waterfall. Nowadays it’s usually included in most Rinjani trekking packages.''However if you’d like to get it to yourself, it’s easy to navigate to from Senaru, the base of Rinjani, and best visited in the early morning before the crowds arrive. There were other people there when I visited later in the afternoon, however I was able to get some shots without others in them with clever camera angles.''On the way you’ll also pass a fork in the trail that takes a short detour to a double-tiered waterfall, Sendang Gile, that is less popular but also a must-see:''Sendang Gile''This hike is a bit more challenging with a couple of areas where you’ll need to walk through streams. There are local boys playing nearby who usually offer a hand. It’s also a pretty clear path so I’m of the opinion that a guide isn’t necessary, though it does give someone a job.''Tiu Teja is another waterfall in the area that I wanted to see but didn’t have time for during the long drive up from Kuta to Senaru. If you have the time to stop by, it looks amazing in photos. It’s also one of the items on''my map.''If you’d rather not drive yourself from Kuta up to Senaru, you can hire a driver to take you up and to stop by the waterfalls on the way. The cost is usually around 750,000 IDR. Ary with Fury Lombok was recommended by a friend. He has a nice roomy SUV. You can''contact him here''.''Rinjani Volcano Trek''So unique and impressive''I highly recommend prioritizing''trekking Rinjani''during your time on Lombok. It’s one of my favorite things I’ve done in Indonesia. The whole trek is picturesque, with impressive views of Bali, the Gilis, and beyond on a clear day.''Most treks last for 3 days/2 nights and depart from either Senaru or Sembalun. I recommend starting in Senaru and finishing in Sembalun so that you summit Rinjani for sunrise on the final day rather than on the second day. It’s a nice way to finish it off. The trek also takes you past the caldera lake pictured above, to hot springs, and along gorgeous scenery.''I also feel it’s a pretty cheap activity all things considered. Most packages include a night of accommodation in Senaru, porters, guides, all the gear you need, and food on the trail. Always book in person once on Lombok instead of ahead of time online. The price is always negotiable! You can ask anyone from the people working at restaurants and guest houses in Senaru to the guys with the stands in Kuta. Shop around for a price you find agreeable.\xa0I understand the pricing these days is usually around 200,000 IDR. It will vary depending on how good the gear is, how nice the food is, the group size and whether or not you want camp chairs and a toilet tent.''I recommend Rozak as a guide. I went with him for my Bukit Pergasingan hike (mentioned next) and adored his thoughtfulness and fun-loving personality. You can contact him at sajangrinjanitrek@gmail.com (feel free to mention me, and that I said to give you a good price 😉 ).''Note that this trek does not take place during the rainiest months in mid November-April.''Bukit Pergasingan and Bukit Selong''A creative commons photo of the viewpoint''If you’re in Lombok during the rainy season but still want to hike, take a look at\xa0Bukit\xa0Pergasingan. It’s a 2-3 hour hike up a steep hill over the rice paddies out of Sembalun, the town that you’d normally either start or end your Rijnani trek in.''However during rainy season, the town is sleepy and mostly empty. It’s a lovely place to stay, and I loved the friendliness of the locals, always giving me a thumbs up and saying hello and asking how I was doing. Plus during the off season, you can get this viewpoint all to yourself.''I did the hike, beginning at 3am hoping to see the sunrise at the top, but unfortunately, the viewpoint was completely fogged in and we couldn’t see anything. We also had to take an alternate route through the rice paddies since the main road was washed out due to rain. Normally I’d say this would be doable without a guide but in my case it wouldn’t have been. (I did this two weeks ago so I’m not sure the route is cleared yet).''To make sure you have a better chance of a view, going during dry season would make more sense, but it will be more crowded. If you don’t like the idea of hiking up in the dark, it’s also common to do an overnight trek.''Alternatively, head to Bukit Selong’s wooden star for another view:''Bukit Selong''This ‘hike’ took about 5 minutes and though it was still a cool view, it has nothing on the mountain across from it (pictured above, across from me).''Contact Rozak, mentioned in the Rinjani section, for this one as well. He’s great!''The Gilis''Gili Trawangan''Finally, no visit to Lombok, Indonesia, would be complete without stopping by the Gilis – a set of three small islands just off the coast of Lombok.''It’s easy to reach by public ferry from Bangsal and only costs a couple of dollars. The ferries depart frequently and leave when full. Buy directly from the ticket counter inside rather than the touts on the street.''Each island has its own charm. Gili Meno is the quietest of the three with few people around and scattered places to stay. Gili Trawangan (Gili T) is the undisputed party island, with mushroom shakes on offer and the famous swing over the water. Gili Air is something in between, with a laid-back atmosphere but it still knows how to party.''Sunset on Gili Air with my friend Caspar''I’ve visited all three, though Gili T only had one hostel when I went five years ago. I loved it and stayed for a week, and two years later, returned and stayed on Gili Air for a week, popping by Gili Meno for an afternoon. I would probably not be interested in the party scene of Gili T these days, though what you pick depends on your desires and how much time you have. I wrote a''more in-depth comparison here''. From the Gilis, you can take a fast boat over to Bali to continue your Indonesia adventure.''Those are some of the best spots on Lombok, Indonesia. Though there are far more things to see than listed and one could spend months or even years on this island alone, this sampling will give you some of the best that the island has to offer. I’d give this itinerary at least 10 days if you include the Gilis and/or Rinjani.''Pin me!''Pin me!''My list is never-ending since I can’t seem to stay away from this island.

The temples, thanks to Tomb Raider, had long enchanted me and it just seemed right to see them with my own eyes.''Cambodia ended up being my favorite country to backpack through during my first 10 months in Southeast Asia. In fact,''this country had me completely smitten''. The kids made me feel like a superstar,''the food was delicious'', and the temples and other incredible places left me in awe.''Now that I am back in Southeast Asia, I realized I never really put together a Cambodia itinerary for you, so here it is! This works for different lengths of stay, as you can pick and choose what to hit and what to miss, starting from the capital, which can be easily reversed or switched up depending on your entry point:''Phnom Penh''The country’s capital is a good place to start your journey in Cambodia, especially if you are flying in. A wide range of food and accommodation options are available for travelers of all budget levels. I’d suggest spending 2 to 3 nights to get a feel of the capital, its people and the country’s history and culture. Here are a few things to do in Phnom Penh:''Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum & The Killing Fields''Be mentally prepared before you visit the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (known as the S-21 Prison) and The Killing Fields – it’s a time traveling experience to a dark time in Cambodia that may leave you in complete shock and disbelief that such genocide has taken place fewer than 40 years ago, during which more than one million people lost their lives in vain under the Khmer Rouge regime.''At the S-21 Prison, photos of some of the victims are lined up on a board, displayed in the rooms that were used to imprison, torture, and kill them. Walking through the rooms, imagining what went down there, is a feeling that words cannot describe. At The Killing Fields, I highly recommend paying the extra to rent the headphones and follow its instructions to tour the area.''Royal Palace & The Silver Pagoda''For a lighter Phnom Penh experience, check out the beautiful Royal Palace and the Silver Pagoda, which are conveniently located next to each other. If you are not ready to pay to enter, the entrance itself is a beautiful place for photography or simply people watching.''Russian Market''I wouldn’t recommend shopping here as prices are highly inflated. However, this Phnom Penh icon is definitely worth a visit to get a feel of the Cambodian market scene. If you want to get some shopping and street food hunting, consider heading to the Kandal Market – you can even get a hair wash and a manicure for less than $5!''Stay'':''Mad Monkey Hostel''or''Saravoan Royal Palace''Sihanoukville''From Phnom Penh, take a bus to Sihanoukville, the gateway to the beautiful island, Koh Rong, and my favorite Cambodian beach, Otres. Sihanoukville has established itself as a party and gambling place that I’m not a huge fan of, but the surroundings are worth staying a few nights, or weeks, in.''Stay:''Onederz Sihanoukville''or''Patchouly Chill House''Otres Beach''Otres is one of my favorite beaches in the world, and in my opinion, one of the''chillest places in Asia''. Unlike the buzzing Sihanoukville, Otres is laid back and quiet. I remember staying on this beach for more than a week, losing track of time and intention to leave. It’s the place to let go and relax. Read more about it''here''.''That said, it’s been more than 5 years since I was there, and from what I’ve gathered, Otres has indeed developed more, but it is still so very beautiful.''Stay'':''Taste of Paradise''Koh Rong''I was pleasantly surprised by how dreamy''Koh Rong''was, though I’ve heard now Koh Rong has turned into a party island. That being said,''like any party islands I’ve been to'', one can always find a quiet, peaceful spot that no one else seems to go.''For Koh Rong, that spot is Sok San Beach. There are basic (we are talking about no fan, no heater, one light bulb that works for a few hours per day kind of basic) bungalows that are right on the beach, facing some of the clearest waters, with\xa0bioluminescence painting the sea with neon lights at night. You might sometimes find yourself the only person walking on the beach. That sounds like a paradise to me.''Stay'':''Sok San Beach Bungalows''Koh Rong Samloem''Koh Rong’s little sister, Koh Rong Samloem, is even more secluded and off-beat. There are only four beaches on this island: Sarancan Bay, which is the most popular out of the four, with better facilitated resort options; M’Pei Beach, located in a fishing village with great diving opportunities; Sunset Beach, with more backpacker-friendly accommodation options; and finally, Lazy Beach, where crossing a jungle is required to gain access. It is many off-beat lovers’ favorite out of the four.''Stay:''Sweet Dreams Samloem''or''Saracen Bay Resort''Kampot''Perhaps it’s a Cambodia thing, but Kampot is another place that many travelers end up staying in much longer than intended. While the frequently-seen retired expat men and extremely young local companion-combo made me feel uneasy, Kampot itself is a charming place to forget about everything else and get lost on a bike.''Other than the slow-paced lifestyle and architecture with a mix of French and Chinese influence, the town is also popular for pepper, which has truly elevated the''culinary palette in Kampot''. Though I’m not a shellfish lover, I hear that the Pepper crab is a do-not-miss. Go to a local market, haggle with the local Khmer saleswomen, and pay to get your crab cooked to perfection with that delicious kampot pepper sauce.''Stay:''Mad Monkey Hostel''or''Sabay Beach''Kep''A sleepy town close to the coast, Kep has a similar atmosphere to Kampot.''Just about a 20-minute boat ride away lies''Rabbit Island'', also known as Koh Tonsay, which is yet another laid back destination that is often overlooked by tourists. I don’t remember seeing any rabbits during my stay, but I certainly remember hopping around happily like one, lost in my own world watching the sunset on a quiet beach with nobody in sight. If you are looking to be completely off the grind, Kep is for you. Most people are here on a day trip from Kampot, but I’d totally recommend staying a few nights. I mean, why not?''Stay:''Khmer House Hostel''Siam Reap''From the coast, head back towards Siem Reap, which might require an overnight in Phnom Penh again.''I’d suggest NOT going to the Angkor Wat right away, but spend your first day soaking in the beauty that is Siam Reap. It’s so dynamic that one blink could result in missing something really interesting. I remember smiling and waving at\xa0a motorbike that drove by with two adults and three children packed on, haggling with 5 Tuk Tuk drivers at the same time, and watching women doing their laundry by the river with babies strapped on their backs. While the city is fast developing with resorts, malls and restaurants, at every corner you can still find the Siam Reap of old.''Pub Street''Buzzing with neon lights at night, Pub Street is an awesome place to hang out after exploring the temples. Just about everyone traveling in Siem Reap goes there, so it’s also a great place to meet people and potentially plan the next few days’ adventures together.''Shopping requires strong haggling skills as prices are definitely inflated here. The party scene is great though, just drink with caution as it’s really easy to knock one too many back when the beer is only 50 cents. If you are riding a motorbike in, make sure you remember where you parked the bike, because the last thing you want is to spend hours looking for your bike in the confusing streets (they all look the same!).''Markets''Siem Reap is not short on markets and they’re all worth exploring. My personal favorite was the Old Market, where you can see old Cambodian ladies squatting next to their products for sale, which could range from vegetables, live seafood, meat, to clothes, household goods and toys. It gets pretty chaotic with locals and tourists squeezing their way through, so it’s always a good idea to''carry a theft-proof bag'', just in case!''Other awesome markets include the Made In Cambodia Market, which offers a refreshing change from the repetitive Angkor Wat t-shirts and elephant pants. Everything in this market is made in Cambodia by local artisans. If you are looking for something unique and would like to fully support the local enterprises, this is definitely the right market for you.''For a good bargain, go to the Angkor Night Market. Whether you will end up with an actual good bargain or not depends on your haggling skills, but $2 massages will always sound like a great bargain to me, and there are plenty of them in the Angkor Night Market!''Angkor Wat''I don’t say “you can’t come here without visiting/doing/eating this” very often, but you can’t go to Siem Reap without visiting the majestic Angkor Wat! It’s one of the most awe-inspiring things I have ever seen in my life. After all, it is often called the “Eighth Wonder of the World”! Read about my Angkor Wat experience''here''and''here''. Entrance fees have gone up several times since I was there in 2012. The latest prices are:''1-day: $37''3-days: $62''7-days: $72''It is a substantial amount when on a backpacker budget, but I’d still highly recommend going for more than one day. You can save on transportation and food by renting your own bike and bringing in your own street food from town. A tuk-tuk driver for a day typically costs about $10 – $15, whereas a bike costs about $2 per day. The restaurants around Angkor Wat are incredibly expensive, sometimes costing twice as much as the restaurants in town! Packing a snack and a big bottle of water and taking a push bike will definitely help save some money on your Angkor Wat adventures, plus it’s more fun!''Stay:''Mad Monkey Hostel''or''Bliss Villa''Battambang''I am not done with the laid back towns of Cambodia! Battambang is not as off-beat as the ones mentioned above, but it’s a good getaway from the hustling Siem Reap for a day.''Located just 3 hours away from Siem Reap by bus, Battambang offers a unique bamboo train experience to visitors. The local government has previously''closed down the station for refurbishment'', and now the train has been rebuilt at another place and is up and running, according to a reader who was just there (thanks, Elvira!). There are also other places worth checking out, such as the bat cave and the Killing Cave, a place that was used to kill and dispose of bodies during Khmer Rouge. The piling of human skulls remind me of the Killing Fields in Phnom Penh, though with less historical information available. It’s also possible to hike up to the summit and imagine what went down there.''Other than that, there are also smaller temples and local markets in Battambang that may seem less impressive than the ones you saw in Siem Reap, but possibly much more authentic and affordable. I recommend spending a day out here before heading back to Siem Reap.''Back to Phnom Penh''After a few days (or few weeks, I really wouldn’t be surprised at all) spent away from it all and playing''Tomb Raider''in the temples, it will be a good time to head back to Phnom Penh, enjoy the street food markets and get a good night’s sleep on an actual bed. Take a bus the next day towards the northeast to Kratie and Banlung.''Kratie''Now if you ever dreamed of becoming a celebrity when you were a child,''Kratie is a good place''to realized that dream, even just for a while. I rode a bicycle around, surrounded by jungle-like flora, cows, and kids who would run out of the wooden shacks to say “hello” gleefully. It was an endless sea of ‘hello!’ all day from the kids, who wanted nothing more than to hear hello back.''The ride itself was also enjoyable, with colonial architecture to admire and occasional nice breeze coming from the Mekong river, which is always welcome in the ever so warm Southeast Asia.''Kratie is also popular for Mekong Irrawaddy dolphin spotting, but it has definitely done more harm than good to the dolphins as no proper regulations and protections are in place. I am not one to push my opinions on anyone, but as tourists, we vote with our dollars, so it’s always helpful to do some research and think twice before participating in animal tourism.''Stay:''River Dolphin Hotel''Banlung''Yet another unruffled town that’s wonderful to get lost in. I am starting to sound a little repetitive now, but honestly, it’s hard to find so many laid back places in one country in Southeast Asia.''While everywhere else is booming in development, somehow Cambodia, outside of the main cities, is keeping things relatively nice and slow. Banlung is about 4 hours north from Kratie, and there are minivans available on a daily basis. To be honest there’s not much to do in here, but that’s sometimes the whole point! When you are done day-dreaming in a hammock, rent a motorbike and head for the volcanic lake and pretty waterfalls close by. If you’re heading north into Laos, this is the perfect place to finish out your Cambodia itinerary.''Stay:''Bee Bee’s Chalets''Those are a few of Cambodia’s more beautiful and special places, though like most of Southeast Asia, it’s always evolving with new places popping up all the time, just ripe for adventure and discovery.''Pin me!''Pin me!''I hope this is helpful for you.

Unlike its neighbor with the same name in Bali, Kuta Lombok is laid back, chilled out, and uncrowded, at least for now.''I first came here four years ago and it’s blown my mind a bit coming back to see how much it has changed. There are more bungalows now, more coffee shops with Mediterranean style food and bamboo straws (yay!), and though it’s rapidly growing,\xa0I found this has only added to its charm.''The people are still friendly, and it’s still a surfer’s paradise.''It’s also the perfect jumping off point for a bunch of activities and beautiful beaches in the south of Lombok. Here were a few of my favorites while in Kuta:''Bukit Merese\xa0(Sunset Point)''Caught two glorious sunsets here!''This viewpoint is popular with visitors to Kuta for two big reasons: It’s only about a 15 minute scooter right away on mostly good roads, and the views are stunning in every direction.''It’s most popular for the sunset since most of the beaches near Kuta are south-facing so it’s one of the only ones where you can see such a stunning sunset view close to Kuta. That said, I would recommend heading there at any time of the day because there are so many strands of sand built into one little area and most of them get a lot less love than the hill itself which only tends to attract crowds at sunset. It’s the perfect place to spend an entire day, if you ask me.''Find it here''.''Batu Payung''Coconut with no straw: Check. Photographer: Check.''This umbrella-shaped rock is just a short drive over from the Sunset point, or a long walk, if you prefer. You can also take a little boat ride from the beach which takes 10 minutes or so, or you can park your scooter closer to the rock and walk over the rocks and along the tide pools.''I decided to walk and it looked like I was the only person all day who had decided to do that. As the boats shuttled tourists from other parts of Indonesia over to the rock, a few asked me if I had walked, and if I was alone, in a mix of surprise and concern! However I thought it was dreamy, watching the fishermen in the bay nearby and getting some exercise.''Upon reaching the rock you may find a few guys selling coconuts. One of their selling points is they will take photos for you, like this one. Not bad to have a photographer and a coconut in exchange for 15,000 RP, I’d say! You can''find it here.''Pantai Mawun''As seen by the drone''Mawun beach is popular for its beauty and was my first stop while exploring the beaches around Kuta. To be honest, it wasn’t my favorite mostly because it didn’t have the character of some of the beaches to follow. Still, it’s only a 10,000 RP fee to park your scooter and have a look. Plus, there are chaise lounges with umbrellas, which most of the other beaches on this list don’t have.''Find it here''.''Pantai Tampah''How cool is this? Felt like such an instagram gold find.''This was my favorite beach in the area for relaxing without any other people around. Their selling point is it is the cleanest beach on Lombok, and there are no touts on the beach (You will find there are often children selling bracelets elsewhere. I don’t really have an opinion to push on this because it’s a tough situation and I don’t have the answers, but I did enjoy the undisturbed silence on this beach).''Another view from around the corner''There was no trash and the locals obviously work hard to clean it daily. It’s not great for swimming since there are a lot of rocks in the water, but I thought that added to its rugged charm. Plus, there’s this little beach hut for one partway down the beach! There’s also a friendly family selling octopus and coconuts on the beach, and it’s nice to support them for their efforts to keep the beach so nice. Definitely stop by this one for some peace and quiet.''Navigate here''(for Lancing as well)''Pantai Lancing''Life is but a dream''Like Tampah, and conveniently located right next-door, Lancing is another pristine and quiet beach. There aren’t any facilities but that was just fine with me!''Also good for snorkeling''When I showed up, there was no one else around except for a local kid. We played around with my drone for a while and then went for a swim. Though there was a language barrier it was such a heartwarming and cute thing to play with him for a little while that afternoon. That’s the lovely thing about an island as quiet as Lombok, these opportunities are still around and as a guest here you are still warmly welcomed.''Pantai Semeti and Telawas''Amazing for sunset!''I absolutely love these two beaches for the sunsets and the incredible volcanic stone. I climbed all over it hand over foot like a monkey, finding something stunning and new around every corner and bend.''This beach is not easy to get to like the others mentioned in this post. The road is truly horrible and I would only recommend it if you’re very confident on a motorbike or have asked a local to drive you. That said, it was one of the coolest features in the area and I highly recommend it! Give it at least a few hours to explore the caves and coves. You can''find it here.''Pantai Selong Belanak''This one is well-loved''This beach is popular with surfers and you will find there are a lot more places to eat and hang out here than the other beaches. There are lounges with umbrellas that you can rent as well.''I ended up there on an Indonesian holiday and found it to be particularly busy, but I’ve heard that it is a lot more laid-back on other days. Given this, I didn’t get to really enjoy the beauty but I was told that’s a shame because it is apparently a nice beach after all. It’s also pretty easy to reach, unlike Semeti. Navigate to it''here''.''Those are just a few of probably hundreds of beaches along the southern coastline of Lombok. With so many hills and peninsulas, little coves and side roads, you could spend weeks just discovering the beaches in and around Kuta. I had about 4 days though I wish I’d had more!''Day Trip to Sumbawa''Day Trip to Sumbawa''The first time I came to Lombok years ago, I passed through its neighboring island, Surabaya, by bus. I remember thinking it was more beautiful than Bali. This time around I wanted to return for a chance to hang on an island that doesn’t get many tourists at all. If you’re into snorkeling, want to surf a wave that almost nobody else is on, or just want to have a beach almost entirely to yourself,''Ozone Adventures''does an amazing day trip from Kuta. Bonus: You get to see the entire southern coastline of Lombok with Rinjani behind it on the way, and a stunning sunset upon your return.''Yoga''Surfing and yoga tend to follow each other – maybe it’s the balance required for both? Kuta is no exception, with two yoga studios to choose from (or alternate between) that offer surfer’s yoga, vinyasa or gentle flow. I tried''Mana''and enjoyed the class. A drop in class costs 100k RP or you can buy a package for a discount. Mana also has accommodation on offer which looked amazing.''Getting there and around''Another shot of Bukit Merese''The easiest, and often cheapest, way to get to Kuta is to fly into Lombok‘s Praya airport and take a taxi down. The cost should be around 100,000 RP for the 20-minute journey. The Blue Bird Taxis run the meter and are trustworthy.''It’s also possible to take the ferry over from Bali or Sumbawa, depending on the direction you’re traveling from. If coming from Bali, head to Padang Bai harbor and take a fast boat over. Prices vary with the average hovering over $50. There’s also a public ferry which is much cheaper (around $3.50) however it’s much slower at about 5-6 hours depending on delays. If on the Gili islands, there is a public boat that costs 15,000 RP and departs when full, usually every 15 minutes or so. However both of these options will drop you off at the northwest side of Lombok at Lembar Harbor.''From there negotiate a taxi down to Kuta for around 250-300k RP, or take a shuttle bus run by Perama, buying the tickets directly from them for the best price.''Once in Kuta, most people rent a motorbike to get around. Plenty of them have attachments for your surfboard or if you’re not a surfer, you can just get a standard one. I paid 50,000 RP per day for mine and stopped on the side of the road from time to time for a bottle of petrol which runs at 10k to fill up the tank about halfway. It’s a cheap and easy way to get around.''The roads alternate between good with a bit gravelly and sandy in places. However this is mostly due to construction and the roads are becoming more accessible and paved with every passing day.''A few words about renting a motorbike: I’d suggest always wearing a helmet, minimize driving at night, and go slowly. If you’re not comfortable, hire a driver and try to split the cost with other people from your guest house.''Eat''We need to talk about this cool fountain thing at El Bazar!''El Bazar:''This place comes up first on Trip Advisor for the best restaurant in Kuta, but I just stumbled in looking for shelter from the rain, was wowed by the decor, and decided to return. The falafel plate was delicious, as was the Moroccan mint tea. Plus how cool is this flamingo sculpture?!''Kenza Cafe'': In a sea of places only serving up instant coffee, I was so delighted to find Kenza coffee with an espresso machine and green smoothies. The coffee here is seriously good, and this is coming from a friend so you can trust my opinion! I also love their healthy breakfasts like the chia pudding parfait and egg white omelet. The prices are Western but it’s worth the splurge.''Local Warung:''If you want to eat local food for local prices''this warung''next to the mosque packs up perfect little lunches to go consisting of rice and a bunch of other things you can choose to throw in like chicken, bamboo curry, tempeh, black beans, and a whole bunch of other options.''Milk and Espresso:''This place really comes alive with live music on Friday nights. Get the steak sandwich!''Sunset Cafe:''I went to''this cafe''twice since it was across the street from where I was staying (and I can be unbelievably lazy about food sometimes) and ordered fresh seafood twice and twice it was good. I brought a friend along and she loved it too. I was surprised that both times we ate there we were the only ones. I’d put this down to location off of the main drag, which is a blessing since nobody was trying to sell us bracelets and we had a nice and quiet dinner for a reasonable price.''Stay''Heaven''During my time in Kuta I stayed at Same Same Bungalows and to be honest, it was just OK. I think for the price it’s possible to find a better option. I’d suggest scouting options on booking.com (''here’s a discount''), booking one or two nights ahead of time, then adding on once you’ve arrived. The price always goes down once you remove the middleman. There are gorgeous''Airbnb''options as well!''I hope this guide helps you to have a magical Kuta adventure. It was amazing to return and see how much it has grown and thrived since the first time I visited almost 5 years ago.

Covering 50,000sq km, it’s home to 580 kinds of coral and almost 1400 species of fish making it a real spectacle for divers, scientists and photographers alike.''We were drawn to its 12,000 islands with the promise of beautiful beaches, remote islands and an array of unique marine life to gaze at.''For divers, the draw of''Raja Ampat is aboard a\xa0liveaboard'', sailing between the North and South amidst the cobalt blue lagoons and below the watchful eye of the jagged prehistoric-esque mountains. They take guests to all of the best dive spots, but what about afterwards?''We went in search of a cultural experience that wouldn’t break the bank and would give us a chance to get to experience the local culture.''we started deep in the heart of the coral triangle in the village of Arborek. Traditionally a mooring spot for boatmen, this authentic island welcomes guests with open arms and bursting with pride, the islanders are eager to introduce all to the Papuan culture.''Surrounded by plush sago palms and nourished by fish, the island is sparsely populated by a very meager 197 residents. Docking at the jetty we were mesmerized by the azure milky waters that hugged the delicate island. Its beaches a fine powdery sand reflecting the rays that beat down on us as we took our first step onto the jetty.''The sound of the boat had attracted quite a crowd and we were welcomed by echoes of “hello mister!” and a cluster of beaming faces, all eager to meet the islands new visitors. We had only just stepped foot on the island, but we knew that we were in for a melange of natural wonders both above and below the water.''As we reached the village we were shown to our homestay, one of a handful of Insta-worthy wooden huts perched perfectly on stilts in the ocean. Homestays on the island have a fixed price agreement of 350,000IDR per person, per night which includes three delicious traditional meals per day and unlimited tea, coffee and water.''There are various homestays dotted throughout the archipelago with most listed on the''Stay Raja Ampat website''.''Looking out from our verandah, we were beckoned to the water with the promise of extraordinary diving in the epicenter of marine biodiversity, housing over 75% of fish species throughout the world, and we weren’t disappointed!''There is something special that happens before every dive, those ten seconds before you deflate your BCD and slip below the surface when your body is a torrent of excitement and apprehension, wondering what it is you’ll encounter.''Submerged, our eyes were treated to a beautiful underwater kingdom. Frenzies of fish swarmed the hard and soft corals, all of which were in competition for a place on the reef, each as beautiful and bright as the one before.''Fusiliers, angelfish, butterflyfish and damsels congregate on the reef flats, barracuda tornados whip around the jetty whilst the armies of trevally, mackerel and tuna assemble a little further into the deep.''No dive in Arborek or Raja Ampat for that matter would be complete without the sighting of a reef shark or many species of manta that circulate the cleaning stations leaving you gawking in awe at their sheer size and grace.''Surfacing we were desperate to reminisce about the marvels from the past 60 minutes. Clocking up over 150 dives between us, this was truly the most spectacular!''Back at our homestay we were greeted by the delicious aromas of cooked garlic and chili. Settling under the shelter, we were presented with a bowl plentiful with rice, fish, noodles, Tempe and of course a generous helping of sambal to awaken our taste buds. Finishing our last few mouthfuls we watched the sky turn to a fluorescent fuchsia shade as we drank in one of the most beautiful sunsets we have ever experienced, with some of our new found friends of course!''For those looking an authentic Raja Ampat experience, a stay at Arborek Village whose inhabitants have been living worlds apart for an eternity, will enable you a rare glimpse into the authentic world of West Papua.''A pretty village with tremendously charming natives, it is extraordinary to be welcomed by the locals who will look longingly into foreign eyes, play football, blow bubbles and embrace their visitors the only way they know how, with kindness and care.''How To Get There:''The beauty of Arborek is its remoteness, making it a haven for those craving an adventure off the beaten path with not a single tourist in sight. However this remoteness does make the village a little more difficult to get to!

Today, I want you to meet Megan, a national park lover who currently works in one, so that she could spend more time exploring!''Here’s Megan’s story, in her own words:''Tell us about yourself!''It all started on a family trip to Georgia with a pair of little red cowboy boots and a tinfoil swan from a Japanese restaurant. Little 6-year-old me must have gotten hooked because I’ve traveled as much as I could since then. I went on a few more family trips to Seattle,''Hawaii'', Slovenia, and back to Georgia. Then as I got older I started traveling through school including trips to New York,''Germany'', Ecuador and the Galapagos, and''New Zealand''.''The next part of the story starts on a warm evening in Wisconsin, July 4, 2015, to be exact, and I was sitting on my friend’s parent’s couch trying to find hotels for the next week. We were going on our first''road trip to the Southwest US''. We were spending two weeks driving around''Utah'', Arizona, and New Mexico, a classic Great American Roadtrip. Our very first stop was Arches National Park and the rest is history. I fell in love with Utah and ended up back there less than a year later to work and explore.''What motivated you to travel alone for the first time?''In Tikal, Guatemala.''Once I settled on my final major in college, sitting in my Structure of English class, I discovered travel blogs. This kicked the wanderlust into a higher gear than it was already at. My friends and I always talked about all these trips we wanted to go on, but nothing was ever coming from these plans.''Fast Forward a year and a half and I had big plans in mind for winter break. I was going to go to Central America for a couple weeks. I soon found out I could actually graduate in December, so my plans changed and I decided to spend two and a half months in there instead. I decided I can either wait who knows how long to go on trips with friends, or''I can suck it up and go on my own'', I mean I was reading about women doing this all the time. I really just got impatient and decided if I’m ever going to travel, I might just have to do some of it on my own, and hey, I ended up loving it!''Tell us about your job at the national parks!''In San Rafael Swell, Utah''At home, I used to work at a little cheese and sandwich shop. One of the girls that used to work there spent a summer working at Yellowstone. After that summer I promptly forgot about it. A few years later, after falling in love with the scenery in Utah on my road trip, I remembered that summer in Yellowstone. It was probably November when I started looking for jobs. I was going to Taiwan and''the Philippines''for a couple months and leaving in January, so I wanted to have a job lined up for when I came home without any money.''I started doing all kinds of Googling for jobs out west from Yellowstone to the Grand Canyon. I was hoping to find something in Southern Utah, hopefully near Moab, so I just kept looking for resorts near all the national parks. I applied for so many jobs. Every now and then I’ll see a sign for a resort and say “Hey! I applied there! Obviously, it didn’t work out.”''The last job I applied for was as a hostess at Lake Powell in southern Utah. I got the call a few days later and here I am, getting ready to go back for a third summer. I ended up being hired as a front desk agent and loved it. My first winter I went to work at a snowmobile lodge about an hour from Jackson, Wyoming. The whole time I’ve been able to explore all the national parks nearby and do tons of hiking.''The only hard part of this is how much stuff you can (or can’t) have with you. If you have a car and can drive there, you can bring more stuff. If you’re flying in, you have to limit your belongings. Plus, a lot of places you’ll have to have a roommate, so you only have so much space in a shared dorm room. The food could usually be better, too. The benefits far outweigh this though!''What are some unexpected benefits of working a seasonal job?''You get to meet tons of awesome people from around the world working in national parks. You get to see so much more of the parks than if you were just visiting for a day or two. You get to see so much of the US working seasonal jobs and you can learn all kinds of new things. And, if you go back to the same place for another season, you probably get a raise, and who doesn’t like that?''Where have you been that you think is perfect for solo female travelers?''Savoring delicious Xiao Long Bao in Taipei, Taiwan''I’ll have to go with Taiwan. It’s super easy to get around the country on trains. I was there for a month and I felt totally safe the whole time, even walking around on my own at night. I didn’t do that often, but I was never worried when I did have to do it. It’s not super crazy with backpackers, but there are enough that you won’t be all alone. It’s easy enough to get off the beaten path, too. Plus, the locals are super helpful and friendly! I had people walk me to MRT stations I couldn’t find. I had people help me buy train tickets. I had someone help me buy a plane ticket and navigate a tiny airport where pretty much no one spoke English. It’s easy to get around Taipei. The food is delicious. And the east coast is a hikers paradise. Even if you don’t leave Taipei, there is plenty of hiking nearby. I just love Taiwan.''What are some obstacles you’ve had to overcome in order to make traveling a lifestyle?''All is well in Monteverde, Costa Rica''I haven’t run into anything too tough. The biggest thing is just not seeing friends and family all that often. I still manage to see my parents a few times a year, but visits with friends have spread out a lot more as we’ve spread out around the US.

I’d long heard stories about how abundant and beautiful everything under the water was, and though remote, I’d been enchanted by the idea of a''liveaboard in Raja Ampat''for years.''Everything else – the afternoons pretending to be a mermaid in the hidden lagoons, the beach bonfires while the sun lit up the sky with color, and the starry skies, free of light pollution, were just an unexpected bonus.''SO MANY FISH!''Under the water it was a show that even Ariel would find impressive. I often felt a bit overwhelmed trying to figure out what to look at first. There was so much diversity in every direction.''Though I can post photo after photo here, it’s really the video that does it justice. It’s some of my best work, I know you’re going to love it!''There were schools upon schools of reef fish in layers, from tiny glittering flecks in the water to huge schools of Jack fish and Barracuda.

I could have cried''I saw a few other favorites like Cuttle fish, Octopus, and more Pygmy seahorses and nudibranchs than I could count as well.''As if that weren’t enough, the corals were the best I’ve seen too. There were so many colors and varieties, it was like a veritable underwater garden.''Beautiful corals''I left certain that Raja Ampat diving is unparalleled, and this is coming from a girl who dived Sipadan, Mozambique, the Maldives, and Komodo, too.''I’ve never seen so many fish in my life.''The boat, the Mutiara Laut, was gorgeous as well. Before the first day was over the crew already had everyone’s name memorized, and were always all smiles. Many of them, including the captain, have been with the boat since the very beginning – almost a decade.''So tastefully done.''The food was delicious, the room was serviced twice daily, laundry was done on board, and I could have all the cappuccinos I wanted. I never actually finished my water glass before it was being filled again by a smiling Wayan, who patiently taught me some Bahasa and Balinese phrases.''I’ve never sailed in such luxury, with a big bed and personal bathroom just for me, all smartly decorated in caramel-colored wood, mother of pearl, and cream white.''Does it get any more beautiful than this??''I’m ruined for boats and dive destinations now, I’m afraid.''I know I’m gushing but I can’t get over how incredible every aspect of the trip was.''We did three dives per day over an 11-day trip which took us to Misool, Penemu, and Dampier Strait. That’s one of several itineraries in Indonesia that the Mutiara Laut does. You can see the rest''here''.''Still, we barely scratched the surface.

I suppose the difficulty in getting there is what has kept it so wild.''I’m already thinking of how I can work another Raja Ampat diving trip into next February.

It’s hard to narrow it down, to be honest. With thousands of temples, tons of gorgeous scenery from north to south, and glistening beaches with towering karst islets, the unique landscape is what has made Thailand so famous worldwide.''I’ve spent a cumulative 5 months on the move in Thailand now, and after much research, have found some seriously beautiful spots. Most of my suggestions are places that are out of the ordinary and will have fewer tourists. I tend to like places that are farther off the beaten path and provide a bit more breathing room.''With that in mind here are 20 of Thailand’s most beautiful places in order from North to South. I bet there are a few, or maybe a bunch, on this list that you haven’t seen before!''1. Mae Hong Son''Gorgeous views on the drive''The cascading mountains of the province of Mae Hong Son, bordering Myanmar, are like a storybook with their misty mountains. It’s a gorgeous journey here from Pai for those who are comfortable driving a car or motorbike. Once there, visit one of the many caves, hot springs, and nature parks. Even if it’s just for a day, driving through there from Pai is a fantastic way to pass the time.''2. White Temple Chiang Rai''The famed White Temple''Thailand is full of ornate temples, but when it comes to originality, the White Temple wins out.\xa0This contemporary style Buddhist temple is unique with its shape, structures, the dazzling white and silver adorning the outside, and the trippy mural on the inside. The style is unlike anything else you’ll see in Thailand, that’s for sure! More on it''here''.''3. Pai Canyon''Such a cool-looking canyon! I just love Pai''Pai is a hippie paradise where you can find yoga, a circus school, a''land split''serving up all things hibiscus, a couple of lovely waterfalls, one of which you can even slide down, and some lovely countryside. But the most unique aspect of Pai is its canyon, With sharp slopes of orange rock winding like a labyrinth. It’s free to enter and easy to get to on a motorbike, like most of''Pai’s best attractions''.''4. Silver Temple Chiang Mai''Meanwhile in Thailand… got so many awesome adventures planned. Found some hidden gems. Stay tuned!''A post shared by''Kristin Addis''(@bemytravelmuse) on''Jan 17, 2018 at 7:27am PST''The silver temple is a unique temple to visit in Chiang Mai in contrast to the gold featured on most temples in the vicinity. The outside is intricate, with allegories of the Tipitaka and the world capitals displayed on the walls.''I wasn’t a fan of the ‘no women allowed’ policy inside the temple. Women still have to pay full price for admission to the temple grounds but aren’t allowed to go inside the main hall. I also just don’t get it, based on my understanding of Buddhism it doesn’t seem necessary, but it’s not my culture and I had to respect it. Still, it’s so unique I put it on this list. It’s an easy and quick pit stop near the South Gate in Chiang Mai and only cost 50 baht.''5. Doi inthanon''The King and Queen Pagoda at the top''Doi Inthanon National Park has it all – multiple waterfalls, a nature trail, Thailand’s tallest peak, Sakura blossoms in January, and the famous King and Queen pagoda near the top. It’s a 3-ish hour drive from Chiang Mai to the east and a lovely day or overnight trip. More on that and a few of the other day trips listed below''here''.''6. Doi Chiang Dao''The top – wow!''Hiking this mountain was a highlight of Thailand’s north for me. It’s the third tallest peak though it’s easily more beautiful than Doi Inthanon’s peak with its starlike shape. The hike can be done as an overnight or day trip, departing from Chiang Mai in the early morning. Find more on how to climb it''here''.''7. Wat Chaloem''Wow!''Thailand’s floating pagodas are about as dreamy as it gets. Though remote and only easily accessible with a car from Chiang Mai, Wat Chaloem is one that most foreign tourists still don’t know about. Take a truck ride to the top and climb the 500 meters of stairs for a stunning view of the entire surroundings including the white pagodas – all of which were carried up by hand! Find more info on how to get there''here''.''8. Emerald Lake''So blue!''Very few non-Thai tourists know about this jungle sinkhole that filled in with crystal clear, deep blue water and huge catfish. It’s considered sacred by the locals and to my knowledge, is the only one in Thailand. It’s somewhat difficult to get to and only makes sense in a car or on a motorbike with tires that can handle mud and dirt. For those who do make it, you’ll be visiting something that’s still a hidden gem in Thailand. Go before the word gets out! Find more info, and a map,''here''.''9. Sukhothai''A monk in orange in Sukhothai (Later I caught him taking a picture of me then we took one together. Seemed fair.)''Thailand’s ancient capital,''Sukhothai'', is often called Thailand’s''Angkor Wat''. Though nothing can compare to the real thing, the crowds at Sukhothai are much smaller and the ruins are a sight all their own. Rent a bike and cycle around the old ruins for a perfect day activity to break up the journey from Bangkok to Chiang Mai.''10. Red Lotus Sea''Dazzling.''Another remote but good one, the Red Lotus Sea is famous for sunrise during the lotus bloom from November to February. The open lotus flowers are made even more brilliant by the dazzling colors in the sky – a photographer’s dream. You can find it''here''in Udon Thani province. The best way to get there is to drive.''11. Wat Sirintorn Wararam''I want to go!!!''Full disclosure, I’ve never been to this glowing wat but it made the list because''look at it''! The glowing Bodhi tree featured in the image above is only part of the glowing goodness – the ground sometimes lights up as well in swirls of blue. It looks like something out of a movie, especially during the Yi Peng lantern release. It’s\xa0located in Ubonratchathani Province near the border with Laos.''12. Erawan National Park''So pretty''This national park is known for its light-colored baby blue waterfalls which cascade down seven tiers. It’s also famous for its caves, featuring streams and rock paintings. It’s also home to deer and elephants! Find it''here''.''13. Koh Chang''Tranquility at its best''Koh Chang is affectionately called the ‘last cheap island’ by those who frequent Thailand. It’s true, the further you head south the more you’ll have to break your wallet open. For an island that’s closer to Bangkok, not as touristy as many of its southern neighbors, and equally gorgeous, take a look at Koh Chang. Lonely Beach, though not so lonely anymore, is a favorite amongst the backpacker crowd though there are white sand beaches just a songthaew ride away, too!''Read more about Koh Chang here.''14. Surin Islands''Not like the rest of Thailand – perhaps even more amazing than the islands down south?''The Surin islands are a stunning collection of rocky islets with some jungle here and there and spectacularly blue water. The more famous Thai islands are known for their sharp karst rock formations but the Surin islands feature flatter rocks, and better diving, too. Though remote, they’re worth a visit and typically included in most''Similan Islands liveaboard''itineraries.''15. Tonsai''Perfect mountains for climbing.''Located on the mainland a short long tail boat ride over from Krabi,''Tonsai''is popular with rock climbers and slack-liners and those who want a more laid back experience than Tonsai’s neighbor, Railay. For those who don’t want to choose between the two, it’s a short jungle walk between Tonsai and Railay, which is worth it for the adventure to the''Railay Lagoon''as well.''16. Koh Yao Noi''Love!''Koh Yao Noi is my favorite Thai Island to date. It’s not a backpacker haven with thumping music or buckets in bars, but rather an island full of eco resorts and some nice peace and quiet. It’s also popular with climbers and yogis. I love that you can still get a beach more or less to yourself here, and it doesn’t take that long to get to from Krabi or Phuket, two major hubs for flights.''Read more here.''17. Koh Yao Yai''Lam Haed beach''For an island with lots to explore and few other tourists, Koh Yao Yai fits the bill. Unlike its neighbors, Phuket and Krabi, Koh Yao Yai receives far fewer visitors and isn’t set up specifically for tourism, which lends itself well to getting beaches all to yourself, like the one pictured above, Laam Haed beach.''18. Koh Pha-ngan''So much beyond the full moon party''Though known for full moon party madness, Koh Phag-nan is so much more than that. Some parts of the island, like''Bottle beach'', are so remote that they’re usually accessed by boat, or very bumpy dirt road. The island has so many gorgeous beaches and quiet places to relax. If the full moon party isn’t for you, or if it is, you have a reason to go either way!''19. Koh Tao''A lovely viewpoint on Koh Tao''This lovely little island is a diver’s haven and, though not exactly under the tourist radar, still a gorgeous place to hang one’s hat. Rent a quad bike and tour around the island, learn how to SCUBA dive, or just chill on the beach. It’s perfect for all three!''20. Koh Lipe''That white sand? That blue water? Name fairly given.''Koh Lipe’s nickname is the Maldives of Thailand, and given that baby blue water, it’s easy to see why. Located south of Koh Lanta, it’s a bit out of the way of the usual tourist trail which has helped it stay so beautiful and pristine.''Those are some of my favorite beautiful places in Thailand, though my search is ongoing (and probably endless).

This 8-day trek over glaciers, multiple passes, through tundra, marshes, and moraine isn’t for solo hikers or first-timers, as it requires route finding with a map and compass, and a bush flight in and back out.

It’s a tea house trek, meaning that you can leave the tents, cooking equipment, food, and basically everything but clothing and snacks behind.''More of the trek is becoming accessible by road, and what was once a minimum 14-day trek can be shrunk down depending on your time constraints. Though at 5416 meters (17,769\xa0feet) in altitude, the Thorung La Pass is not to be taken lightly. The highest season is in November with April following in popularity.

So amazing''The Huemul Circuit out of El Chalten, Argentinian Patagonia, is one of only four trails in Patagonia that provides a view of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, the third largest frozen body of fresh water in the world.''This hike isn’t easy. You’ll need to carry along all of your gear and provisions for four days, bring along a map with the GPS points routed ahead of time since the trail can be unclear, pull yourself across two rivers with a harness and pulley, and prepare for one of the craziest downhills around. It’s nearly three hours of a steep descent on loose dirt, however the view is unmatched in Patagonia, and that’s saying a lot!''The difficulty is what keeps most visitors away, so if you’re feeling adventurous,''read about how to do it here''.''The O in Torres del Paine, Chile: Moderate (130 km, 80.1 mi)''Las Torres, the park’s most famous feature.''Patagonia’s most loved trek, the circuit in Torres del Paine National Park in Chile, earned its fame for a reason.

You can camp overnight right under the famous Jacob Hamblin Arch, and wander through all day long without seeing more than a few other people along the way.

The hike is steep in the beginning and the end, and flat in the middle. It takes you through a temperate jungle, full of interesting vines growing through rocks, sakura blossoms depending on time of year, and up to a peak with 360-degree views of undulating mountain after mountain.''I expected this to be a sweaty, buggy affair, but found the hike to be pleasant and even a bit cold.

Hiking in with the stars, seeing the amazing blue flames (and trying not to choke from the fumes) and marveling at the local workers who haul sulfur up and down the mountain all day, made this one of my favorite travel experiences to date. It’s a fairly easy morning hike – just make sure to bring a head lamp!''At the time that I did this hike 5 years ago, there was hardly any information about it and there were only a few people who made it to the flames. I understand that the popularity has exploded since (It’s one of my''most popular blog posts''– sorry!), but I still think it must be an incredible experience.

Rinjani, Lombok, Indonesia: Mostly moderate, one Difficult Part (Varies)''So unique and impressive''Mt. Rinjani is quickly becoming one of Indonesia’s most popular treks, but it’s no surprise given how stunning the entire trek is. Most routes last for 3 days, 2 nights, and pass through varied landscape consisting of the volcano within a caldera pictured above, hot springs, and the sunrise peak at the top with views all the way to Bali.''The best way to organize the trek is to show up on Lombok and book in person. It can be about half the price of booking online! Quality of gear varies, but everyone sticks to the same route, though it’s possible to reverse it depending on your preferred starting point.

My personal favorites are all along the''Pacific Coast Highway''.''But for those who want a challenge, there’s the Cactus to Clouds trail. It has one of the greatest elevation increases in any day-hike routes in the United States with a net elevation gain of 10,400 feet (3200 meters) over only 16 miles (26 km). The trail only makes sense to attempt in the fall or spring when there’s no snow and the heat isn’t as intense yet.

It tends to cater to a higher end and sporty crowd and has maintained a peaceful elegance that I hadn’t found yet in Thailand.''Here’s a video of both islands, including drone footage:''If you want an island without thumping reggae, are cool with ditching the hostels, and just want some peace and quiet in the jungle, pick Koh Yao Noi (but keep it a secret, okay?).''Things to do''Rock climb, yoga, swim, chill, repeat''For the most part, people head to Koh Yao Noi to enjoy the beach.

If you have a bit of experience, though, the views while you climb are stunning.''Most visitors also rent motorbikes to explore the island’s waterfalls and many beaches with only a few other tourists, if any at all.''If you want to check out neighboring Koh Yao Yai, it’s also possible to take a longtail boat over from the south side of Koh Yao Noi for 50 baht, and worth it for an afternoon if you’re a fan of sandbar beaches like this one:''Lam Haed beach''Additionally it’s easy to book an island hopping tour or to take out a kayak if you want to explore the islands nearby.''Stay''Loved this swing on the beach at Paradise Koh Yao''Even if you’re not usually a resort person, Koh Yao Noi is the place to splurge. Most of the resorts are smaller in size and designed to be eco-friendly with relaxation in mind. I stayed at''Paradise Koh Yao''for a couple of days on the island and thought it was fantastic. It’s a secluded, relaxed, and gorgeous high-end boutique resort with hillside bungalows in a dreamy setting.''While I’m not as into mega resorts, I love little hideaways like this.

I find that places with a common interest like a sport tend to be good for solo traveling, because whether people are alone or with others, they’re going to go there for the love of their sport.''There are also cooking classes and a few quirky coffee shops and a bar or two, so you’ll have chances to meet others.''Getting there''Koh Yao Noi from above''Koh Yao Noi is easy enough to reach by longtail or speed boat from Phuket and Krabi, both of which have airports.''From Phuket, boats depart from the Bangrong pier almost hourly and cost 200 baht. From Krabi, head to the Ta Len pier and catch either a longtail or speed boat. They also depart almost hourly and cost between 150 and 200 baht depending on the speed. To get to the pier, you can take a Songthaew from Krabi town to the bus station for 30 baht, and a larger songthaew ‘bus’ from the bus station to the pier for 100 baht. Reverse the journey to come back and fly out or onwards to your next destination.''After a week spent between Koh Yao Yai and Koh Yao Noi, with Yao Noi being my favorite by far for the better views, I left feeling relaxed, recharged, and happy.

Blogging is such a new industry that’s always evolving, and if I wasn’t in it, I’d wonder too.''So here’s how I’ve been doing it for so long, and how my budget has evolved over time:''In the Beginning''The early days, so in love with traveling in Cambodia''Early on, I traveled off of $20k in savings on a strict shoestring budget. I moved slowly through Southeast Asia, mostly overland on cheap buses and trains, and spent about 10k on the ground over 10 months, which I consolidated and covered in this post about what''six months of traveling in Southeast Asia cost me''.''I slept in shared dorm rooms that ranged from $2-$5 per night, ate mostly street food (still do when I’m in Southeast Asia), and learned to haggle like a boss.''I always had my budget in mind. I kept meticulous daily records so that I didn’t go over my spending limit, which was $30 per day on average. That meant that every bar of soap, visa fee, and pair of flip flops I bought went into the calculations.''If there was a way to share a taxi, I’d get social and ask around, or if I could possibly avoid the tourist mode of transport, I would find the local way, and was often''the only foreign person''taking that overnight ferry or 50-cent train ride. It resulted in some amazing stories, and some 36-hour journeys. I was rich in time but not in cash, so I took the longer, but often more interesting, road everywhere.''In my second year of traveling, I kept to my strict budget and stuck to Asia. I finished up my Southeast Asia travels in Vietnam and ventured into China, still opting for shared dorms and eating cheaply whenever possible.''Once I got to China, my money started dwindling so''I started hitchhiking.''Sometimes it was dirty, it was almost always sweaty, and each and every time it was simply amazing. I loved it. I cherish those memories so much. I’m so glad that I had that experience, even if it did mean that for almost two years, I didn’t have a room to myself, almost never took the more expensive plane flight, and roughed it every time.''These days, with so many fancy resorts and apparent perfection all over Instagram, I think it often looks like travel is out of reach, but what I did in the early days was anything but glamorous, and in reach for those who are willing to save up and make it happen.''Then, it evolved''Spending a bit more by venturing to South Africa''Once I started earning money by freelancing (''details on how I did that here''), I did dorms less frequently and started exploring other parts of the world outside of Asia. I still had my budget in mind and tried not to spend over $20 per night on accommodation.''I wasn’t getting paid all that much for my work yet, but I was able to break even, roughly doubling my yearly spend on travel to $20,000 per year. You can see the breakdown in my''budgeting South Africa''post for an idea.''It helped that I still kept track of my budget, still looked for ways to split the costs with people, and did not make purchases like coffee at coffee shops, movie tickets, expensive nights out, and costly restaurants. I still traveled and lived like I was on a shoestring, but in more expensive places and minus the dorm rooms. After two years of them, I was done.''Nowadays''Easter Island: Not exactly a budget destination''Now that I work while I travel, it’s okay to spend more money, and I’m getting closer to dropping $30k per year. I’ve stopped picking adventures based on affordability (I spent a pretty penny on my''Southwest American Road Trip'',''Iceland'', and''Patagonia''). I’ll tend to opt for a more remote place that costs more to get to because I want to write about something unique that not everyone has heard of before.''I’m also sometimes paid to go on video and photography projects in which case the travel is paid for. I have also managed to avoid paying for flights for almost a year by travel hacking and racking up mileage points, which is hugely helpful. None of that is reliable or constant, though.''Sometimes I’m able to work out a media discount, but it’s less often than I think many assume. I turn down a lot of opportunities because they don’t feel genuine enough to me, therefore I end up paying more and making less.\xa0Right now in Thailand, for example, I’m paying for the entire trip with the exception of 2 nights in a hotel in Koh Yao Noi. I love this kind of traveling, though, because everything I do is on my terms, and every photo I take is one that I alone own.''So to answer the budget question, it appears that it’s gone up by $10k with each step – the first towards more expensive destinations and fewer dorms, and next to more remote places and no dorms at all. As I get older, I do want more convenience and comfort, which I think is pretty normal!''This blog does fully support all of my travel expenses, though it was a long road to this point. I go into all of the detail on''how it evolved in this post'', and give a lot of''tips on how to start a travel blog''if it’s something you’re interested in trying.''I hope if you have dreams of traveling long term that it feels within reach.

It’s a more environmentally friendly and less inconvenient way of dealing with the monthly visitor we ladies have all come to know and loathe.''Travel Insurance''Though healthcare services in Southeast Asia can be cheap for minor issues, if you have an issue SCUBA diving, break a limb while trekking, or come down with an illness like dengue fever (not uncommon in SE Asia and there is nothing you can take to prevent it) and need to be hospitalized, you’re looking at some hefty bills.''Travel Insurance''is not very expensive and can help you get home or to a country with better medical care if you need to. It can also pay for a loved one to come to you.''Clothing:''Lightweight dresses (you can find the one in the photo''here'') are perfect for temples and religious sites.''Keep in mind that in Southeast Asia in general, people tend to dress conservatively. It’s best to cover your knees and shoulders when possible, and not to show excess booty or cleavage. You’ll also need to be covered up to gain access to temples.

As for Liz, she decided that her daughter can tag along, and together, they trekked through Australia’s Bicentennial National Trail.''Now I realize that this isn’t your typical solo female travel story since Liz was not, in fact, alone, but she was solo in a different way – being fully responsible for her daughter during this journey that she embarked on as a solo parent. I was moved by her bravery and tenacity and I’m betting that you will be, too.''Pin me!''Here’s Liz’s story:''What motivated you to kickstart your adventures on the BNT with your daughter?''The dynamic duo''It had been my dream for quite some time to save up and take a year off work to travel with my young daughter. But where? And how?''Backpacking through Europe''? Volunteering in orphanages in South East Asia? We live in a world full of opportunities and choices, and at times it can be''hard to finally bite the bullet and make a decision''. I knew that I wanted this year to be big – something neither of us would ever forget. I also wanted a challenge; something that would push the both of us out of our comfort zones and force us to learn to draw on our inner strength.''So when I heard about Australia’s Bicentennial National Trail, I was enthralled. Previously known as the National Horse Trail, the BNT stretches an incredible 3311 miles (5330km) between Healesville in the south and Cooktown in far north Queensland. It follows the foothills of the Great Dividing Range and the Eastern Escarpment, revealing some of the most spectacular scenery in the country. The trail provides access through some of Australia’s wildest, most inaccessible country, and is thought to be the longest trail of its type in the world.''After further research, I found that previous trekkers had tackled the trail by donkey, horseback, on foot, by bicycle, and even with camels. However, not many had made it through the whole 3000 some miles. Being a horse-mad woman from way back, I was sold. I had found our big year, our dream trip, our challenge! I decided that over the course of the next 18 months, I would acquire suitable horses and prepare them for the challenges of the trail.''What are some unexpected benefits of long term traveling with your child?''Liz’s awesome daughter!''Since her year on the trail, my daughter has shown a real knack for resourceful- making the best of what she’s got in front of her. She’s also''comfortable with being alone''and not having to reply on anyone or anything else for entertainment, and I think the long days on the trail really helped develop her inner resilience and fortitude.''What are some of the biggest challenges you face traveling with your child as a single parent?''crossing through good and bad times, together.''I always found it a bit disconcerting being the ‘only adult’. After all, if something happened to me, what would happen to my daughter? Now that she is a bit older, I make sure she knows how to use our emergency SPOT tracker if I am unable to for any reason, and we talk about what to do if either of us has an accident.''Where have you been that you think is perfect for female travelers with children?''on the BNT Trail''The whole BNT is great for solo females and in fact it is mostly females trekkers that take it on. Almost everyone we met on the trail was wonderfully enthusiastic.''My daughter and I walked the Camino do Santiago in Spain a few years ago, which I thought was an ideal experience for children. Everyone makes a fuss of the kids on the trail, there are so many things to see, people to meet, and experiences to keep them occupied.''What are some obstacles you’ve had to overcome in order to make traveling a lifestyle?''I try to work a few years while simultaneously planning the next big trip, then take a chunk of time off to go adventuring, then repeat. Ive been working a year now since finishing the BNT, and the next adventure is the Mongol Derby in 2018!''What is your advice to single parents out there who want to have a similar adventure with their children?''Preparation is key- make sure you have considered every scenario and made sure you are prepared for it. Build up to bigger, more challenging trips by taking smaller, bite-sized ones first.

This time, I wanted to go more local and see things that I hadn’t seen all over the internet yet.''Thailand’s north is full of national parks, waterfalls, mountain peaks, and incredible temples. It seems you’d need months to feel like you really saw the best of it, but as it were, I had about a week to road trip around.''After hours of driving Thailand’s lovely roads, seeing things I never knew existed here, these are eight of the best Chiang Mai day trips that you’re not likely to see much info on yet. This is the hidden Thailand that you won’t find all over Instagram yet. Some of these you can take public transport to, and others are much, much easier to drive to either by car or motorbike:''Doi Chiang Dao''An amazing hike!''Doi Luang Chiang Dao is Thailand’s third tallest peak (Doi Inthanon is number one), though the view must be the most beautiful in all of Thailand. Once you get to the top, if it’s a clear day, you’ll see undulating mountain after undulating mountain as far as the eye can see. The rock formations are incredible up there.''Like most of the other spots mentioned in this post, this hike was plenty crowded with Thai people, but hardly any other farangs (foreigners). Each person who passed me would smile, respond warmly, and giggle every time I said ‘sa wat dee ka!’ And those who knew English welcomed me to Thailand and encouraged me as I headed higher up the mountain.''What a contrast to the short hello or curt head nod that’s common in the Alps or Sierras!''This hike is commonly done as a 2 day, one night hike, though it’s possible to leave Chiang Mai very early in the morning to drive the hour and a half up, get to the base, hike up and down in one day, and head back to Chiang Mai for the night, though I’d suggest staying in the area to rest and enjoy the brisk mountain environment afterwards and chill out.''To get there, navigate to the Doi Chiang Dao national park entrance.''More here''on how to climb it.''Stay:''Hot Coffee Guest House''Wat Chaloem''What else is there to say but “WOW!”?''At first glance, it seems like these floating pagodas have to be in Bhutan. Those glowing white and gold structures dotting the sharp mountain peaks look otherworldly, like they could only exist in a movie.''I wondered if it would really be that great in person, and it was! Even better, I saw zero farang there, though it was plenty popular with locals.''The entrance fee is 200 baht and a compulsory 80 baht fee for the truck to bring you up to the steps, which you’ll climb for 500 meters to the top of the mountain. I recommend getting there very early in the morning to see the mist hang in the hills, and to avoid crowds.''To get there, navigate''here''. It’s about a three hour drive away from Chiang Mai, and can also be combined with the next stop on this list if you want to make it a multi-day adventure.''More about the wat here.''Emerald Lake''Dazzlingly blue and clear''This sinkhole in the jungle filled with crystal clear blue water reminded me so much of the''cenotes in Mexico''. It was amazing to see that they exist elsewhere, too.''The pool is yet another attraction that doesn’t seem to be very well known outside of the local visitors, who consider it to be a sacred pool. That means there’s no swimming or fishing allowed, but you are welcome to sit and admire all afternoon, which I did!''It’s a somewhat narrow and in some parts, dirt road to get there. In this case, it’s both the journey and the destination that make this place interesting.''More here''.''Chiang Rai''The famed White Temple''The White Temple in Chiang Rai really is a sight to see. No photo can do it justice – you’ve got to see this in person.''This contemporary style Buddhist temple is unique with its shape, structures, the dazzling white and silver adorning the outside, and the trippy mural on the inside.''If you’re not driving yourself from Chiang Mai, you can take a''green bus''for under 200 baht. Though this can be booked as part of a tour for closer to $60 and done as a day trip from Chiang Mai, I highly recommend going the day before, staying overnight, and arriving early in the morning so that you’re not sharing it with as many people. It will still be crowded, but it won’t be anything like the crowds that descend on it by midday.''More info here.''Pha Chor''Such a cool canyon''Heading west of Chiang Mai towards Doi Inthanon, there are two popular stops – the Grand Canyon which is popular for swimming, and Pha Chor, this orange canyon.''Doi Inthanon''The King and Queen Pagoda at the top''Doi Inthanon National Park is home to several waterfalls, a nice nature trail, and Thailand’s tallest peak. The park’s most famous features are the King and Queen Pagoda, pictured here. The park also has sakura blooms in mid-to-late January, which are lovely.''The stairs officially close at 5pm to the pagodas, as will the gates that grant entry for 60 baht per person, but you can stay a bit later if you’re already up there. Golden hour is a lovely time to watch as the sun reflects on the golden tops of the pagodas!''Watch the video here:''The park entrance costs 300 baht, plus 30 for a car if you drive yourself in. Leave plenty of time to enjoy the park since it’s big with a lot to see, and a steep entry price to boot. It takes about three hours to reach the top from Chiang Mai.''A car rental for the day will set you back 1000 baht, and a private car with a driver is closer to 3000. There are also tours available but those won’t give you the freedom to stay as late as you like or pick and choose your activities.''Mae Ya Waterfall''Doi Inthanon’s tallest waterfall''The Mae Ya waterfall is also located in Doi Inthanon National Park, though it’s an additional hour of driving round trip to reach it. If you love waterfalls, it’s worth it since this is the tallest and most magnificent one in the park, and it’s a lot less crowded than the other ones will be.''The entrance to the waterfall is the same as the Doi Inthanon National Park ticket, so either buy it here if you head to the waterfall first, or retain the one that you buy at the park to show the rangers at the entrance so that you don’t double pay. Navigate to it''here.''Elephant Nature Park''What a cool experience!''It’s hard to visit Thailand without being tempted by an elephant adventure. However the rumors about riding them are true – it’s bad for the elephant due to the orientation of their spine, and the training methods are abhorrent. If you still want the elephant experience without the guilt, I highly recommend Elephant Nature Park, which is full of rescued elephants with a new lease on life.''Trips range from one day to several, giving you an opportunity to feed and bathe the elephants, and to walk with them, or even volunteer on site. The tours will pick you up from your hotel early in the morning and provide transport and lunch.''More on my experience here.''About driving in Thailand''To be honest, I never considered renting a car in Thailand until a friend of mine who recently moved to Chiang Mai did it for a longer road trip up north. At first I thought he was crazy, but once we got out of Chiang Mai the traffic made way for open roads and a relaxed road trip experience. I’d do it again in a heartbeat.''The car was a basic Toyota coupe with 4 seats and a roomy enough trunk. It didn’t have a lot of power to it but it still worked on those winding mountain roads and had great fuel economy. It set me back 1000 baht per day plus gas, but it was worth it for the freedom.''One could also rent a motorbike though it’ll take you much longer to get around, however the flipside is it’s cheaper.''I’d also heard that an international driver’s license is necessary to drive in Thailand. Officially this is true, however the rental companies don’t generally ask for proof of it and if you do get pulled over, you’ll be fined 500 baht and can retain the receipt to show the police if you get pulled over again. Apparently the ticket allows you to drive for the next three days. Sounds ridiculous but it’s true. All that said, we never got pulled over.''Such an amazing experience.''Those were a few of my favorite day trips from Chiang Mai, some of which are loved by foreigners and locals alike, and some of which I had never seen or heard of before.\xa0I only had about five days to explore, but also highly recommend''Pai''and Mae Hong Song if you’ve got more.''Pin me!''Traveling in Thailand’s more ‘local’ places showed me a side of the country that I fell head over heels in love with. It reminded me of why Thailand is called the Land of Smiles, and showed me that yes, it is possible to see a non-farang side quite easily – you just have to head off the beaten track a little bit.''READ NEXT: The Ideal Route for Backpacking in Thailand''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Doi Luang Chiang Dao is Thailand’s third tallest peak, accessible via a fairly easy drive 1.5 hours from Chiang Mai and surrounded by mountain after mountain in every direction. In a word, it’s stunning.''The hike itself is also lovely. It’s steep in parts, though not overly so, weaving through a jungle over mountain saddles and up to a peak that gives you what must be the most beautiful and expansive view in Thailand. After comparing with Doi Inthanon, this one might not be as tall but it’s so much better.''It’s pretty hard to find any concrete information online about this hike. I was left with more questions than answers before attempting it myself: Does one need a guide? Is it necessary to book weeks in advance? Is it possible to do it in one day?''The top – wow!''We arrived at the park area well after dark the night before we aimed to do the hike. Everywhere I might be able to inquire was closed, so all I could really do was just go and see. Thankfully it worked out, but for those who would like to plan ahead a bit more, here’s what I found out about hiking Doi Luang Chiang Dao:''Independently or with a guide?''This is the tricky part. I read online that one needs a guide, and also that one doesn’t need a guide. Which is true? There’s not much in place to enforce the rule of taking a guide, if it is a hard rule, and the trail is easy to navigate, so you’re unlikely to get lost without one. It’s not really possible to book one the day of due to the park office opening late (8:30am) and sometimes availability of guides is limited.''Therefore you must book in advance, at least one day before at the park office, which is in a different location than the park entrance. You’ll need to get there before they close at 4pm. The guide costs 1000 baht and will probably not speak English.''That said it’s a small fee, really, and provides a job for someone.''I had also read that booking several weeks in advance is necessary. Perhaps this is true during the highest season, though in late January didn’t seem to be the case.''It’s also possible to join an organized 2 day, 1 night hike with a guide and porters if you’d like to camp out and see the sunrise and sunset from the top, which must be spectacular. This is by far the most popular option and you’ll mostly be with Thai people, which if the abundant friendliness on the trail is any indication, is probably a pretty cool experience.''The view at the halfway point''If attempting in one day, the earlier you go the better. If driving, you’ll enter the park headquarters where you’ll be asked to pay 200 baht per person plus a vehicle fee if you’re driving yourself. It’s also possible to take a taxi.''The first obvious clearing to your left is where it starts, about 14km up the road from the entrance. Be careful, as there’s a huge dip in the dirt and there’s just one area, at least when I was there, where you can safely pull off the road and into the parking area.''To the left, there’s a ‘do not enter’ sign, which is, ironically enough, exactly where to enter and start the hike. Next you’ll see a pile of walking sticks and a few parked motorbikes.''From there it’s a straightforward hike all the way to the top through a gorgeous forest with tropical plants, tall trees wrapping around rocks, bamboo, and in mid January, even some cherry blossoms.''Such a lovely hike''There will be several forks in the road with signs that are only in Thai. At each one, veer left and you’ll stay on the correct trail.''Towards the end, there will be a large camping area that lasts for several hundred meters. Keep walking through it and up to the top.''Again, I’m not encouraging that you go without a guide, but I did notice during the hike that it would be doable independently with relative ease.''Is it possible in one day?''Sunset on the drive in the day before.''A few posts I saw online insisted that doing the hike in one day would be impossible or incredibly difficult. I disagree. This hike was only moderately difficult (by my standards – everyone is different) and at about 12km roundtrip, which is totally doable if you leave early enough in the morning.''I started at 7am and finished at 4pm, including plenty of time at the top and lots of photo stops.''The beginning and the end are steep, with a bit of rock scrambling at the top. I imagine shortly after it rains the trail is muddy and difficult. However I found it to be pretty manageable just in running shoes.''One big benefit of doing it in one day is the possibility of having the top to yourself. I passed what must have been at least 70 people coming down as I was going up, since most people don’t do it in one day. The sunrise and sunset are undoubtedly incredible, but also crowded, so unfortunately, you will miss that doing it in one day only. Unless you hike in with the stars, which I suppose is possible.''Other Tips''Though you can leave Chiang Mai in the very early morning — like while it’s still dark out — to make it up to the trailhead, I suggest booking a couple of nights in Chiang Dao. It’s a lovely little town and it’s nice to have a laid back and relaxed evening before and after the hike, should you choose to do it in one day. I stayed at''Chiang Dao Story Camp''and thought it was lovely.''Also, bundle up! It gets cold up there, especially if you camp overnight at the top.''Additionally, if you can make this part of a bigger road trip, do! There are so many amazing things in the areas surrounding Chiang Mai, much of which are unknown to other tourists, which to me, makes them all the more special.''Pin me!''Doi Luang Chiang Dao was a highlight of the north for me, and a lovely hike that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Delightfully, the entrance was free as well, in contrast to 300 baht for Doi Inthanon and 200 baht for most of the national parks I visited on the road trip around Chiang Mai, which included this stop.''Getting There''Initially, my road trip buddies and I weren’t sure if it was worth the extra 3 hours of driving that we’d tack on by adding this lake to the itinerary. It’s located in the Ngao district of Lampang in Tham Pha National Park, accessible''here''down a narrow concrete and partially dirt road.''I’m glad we made the choice to go. It was pretty amazing seeing a cenote on the other side of the world from Mexico, the only place I previously thought they existed.''It’s located about 3 and a half hours east of Chiang Mai and over two hours from our previous (mindblowing) stop,''Wat Chaloem''.''Initially we got a little lost on the way, as I came to find that sometimes Google Maps is a bit weird to follow in rural Thailand. To avoid that, stay on route 1013 instead of taking Google Maps’ proposed shortcut, and you’ll see signs with images of the Emerald Lake that will direct you the rest of the way.''Ashley looking at the fish.''We’d rented a cheap Toyota with a tiny engine and were able to make it there, though on a muddy day after rain, I’d recommend a motorbike with tires that can handle mud or a pickup truck. Much of the road is just packed dirt and in places it’s a bit steep.''Once you arrive at the parking lot, it’s a 100-meter, super short and easy walk to the lake.''Other Things to Note''Amazed''Since the lake is considered sacred, swimming, fishing, and feeding the fish are not allowed.''As tempting as it is to go for a swim, especially since it’s so clear and refreshing-looking, resisting keeps it in its pristine state.''Regardless, it’s an enchanting little stop and one that I never expected to see in Thailand.''This was just one of many stops on an incredible road trip around Chiang Mai, and only whetted my appetite to see more of Thailand’s lesser-known provinces.''Pin me!''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Staring out at the glistening white sand bar, watching as the tides and waves played their game on Koh Yao Yai that morning, the only emotion present in me was bliss.''I knew this feeling.

I’ll never forget the thrill of whipping through''Borneo on a motorbike''or eating my first plate of street food, and I’ll always cherish those dharma bum years. I’m not so much a backpacker anymore but those experiences made me who I am.''Thailand will always represent the portal to this side of me that I might not have otherwise discovered.''At the retreat center,''New Life Foundation'', in Chiang Rai.''It has been almost entirely different this time, though. For starters, I think my dorm days are behind me, and have largely stayed in private rooms and hotels this time around.''I also started things off at a silent meditation retreat, almost five years later to the day of my first ever (and only ever) other''Vipassana experience''.''However this meditation retreat was a lot different. I’d never meditated before the previous one, and this time, I’ve had all of the years since then to''become more spiritual''.''It’s kind of funny, before I was searching out the party crowd and this time I sought out silence. Yet it was the perfect way to kick off this Thailand trip – one that took me on a road trip with my new team member, Ashley, and my''adventure tour partner'', Pete, to some of Thailand’s local, hidden places.''That’s something I never could have done before. It’s kind of crazy to think about how this time, we were all on a road trip because we’d met through this blog. Kristin 5 years ago only dreamed of that possibility.''A fantastic discovery in Northern Thailand.''I was a backpacker before through and through. I took pride in every dollar saved, loved staying in dorms in hostels, wanted to head to chilled out places that, while not super built up and busy yet, were undoubtedly there to serve tourists, like''Tonsai''and''Pai''.''I still cherish those places, but this time, I was happy to show up and only see locals, or to head to a beach on Koh Yao Yai and only see a few others there – no reggae music blasting (I''do''still love me some reggae, though!).''So to answer the question I was unsure about previously – yes, Thailand is awesome no matter what age you are.

There aren’t buses that can take you there, and it’s a solid two and a half hour drive from Chiang Mai by car, or longer by motorbike.''However it’s easy to navigate to, and once you get out of Chiang Mai, the drive is quite pleasant along a relaxed highway that winds through the jungle and trees. I rented a car to go there as part of a larger road trip around Chiang Mai and, though I previously would have thought that driving in Thailand would be crazy and terrifying, I found it to be easy and laid back. The car rental set me back about 1000 baht per day which, when you split it with others, isn’t bad.''You can navigate to it''here''.''Alternatively, you can bus into Chae hom or fly into Lampang and take a taxi from there. Though honestly, both will be more annoying and a lot more expensive than just driving yourself.''Another view – it’s astounding in every direction.''Once you get to the entrance of the wat, you’ll need to buy a ticket for 200 baht, and a compulsory songthaew ticket for 80 baht per person. Once the truck is loaded up it takes you most of the way up the mountain until you reach a set of stairs to climb the remaining 500 meters up.''The view along the way is gorgeous, but the most amazing part is, of course, at the top.''Up and up (and up)''When to Go''Wat Chaloem might not be super popular with foreigners yet, but it is well loved by Thais, so plan on sharing it with a lot of other people if you go there on a weekend or during the middle of the day.''Tickets officially start to go on sale at 7:30am and finish at 4:30pm, though you can stay up there until 6pm and when I showed up at 7:15am, they were happy to sell me a ticket and take me up a bit earlier. On holidays, it opens a half hour earlier and closes a half hour later.''The morning is a fantastic time to go to see the mist still hanging in the village below, plus, you won’t have nearly as many people to share it with if you go early.''I can’t get over it!''There are also plenty of food stalls at the bottom if you want to grab breakfast after you go up.''Where to Stay''Gah! So much wow!''I didn’t find any places to stay online before heading out to Wat Chaloem which had me a little worried, but once I arrived I found it’s popular enough to warrant a local guesthouse with rooms for 500 baht each. You can find it''here''. Call\xa006-1997-6988\u202c to check availability – the owner speaks some English.''The guesthouse is about 15 minutes away from the wat,\xa0and it was a nice, clean place to stay.

If you are open to staying in such places, it’s as simple as going to the common room. I found that even as a''sometimes-shy person'', it didn’t matter because people would talk to me.''By contrast, if you go to a big city and stay in a private hotel room, you effectively eliminate the possibility that you will meet people at your accommodation.''I don’t really like staying in dorms anymore, so that means I have to take a more active role in finding activities to do with other people. That brings me to my next point:''Actively participate in things that will help you meet others''With new friends in Mozambique''I don’t stay in dorms anymore, so I meet people by signing up for group activities, like''scuba diving'',''surf school'', or''cooking classes''. You can also take walking tours, look up''meetup''groups, and check out the Facebook groups as well for whatever destination you’re going to.''I also like to put out the call on my Facebook page to see if any friends of mine know people in the place I’m going to. It’s how I met an amazing group in South Africa, realized I already knew people in Chiang Mai, and have found travel buddies from time to time. As you travel more, your network will expand to provide more and more opportunities as well.''Be smart about your safety''The biggest misconception there is about solo travel is that it is inherently dangerous. I completely disagree with this, because bad things can happen whether you are by yourself or with someone else, it just comes down to having your wits about you.''Both men and women tend to run into trouble late at night, and especially while intoxicated.

But with so many options, you might be wondering where to start.''Below are some of my favorites in the USA, plus the advice of several other solo female travelers to get you started:''1. San Francisco, California''At Baker Beach''Whenever people who aren’t from the state visit California almost everyone ends up falling in love with San Francisco. As a native Southern Californian it’s in my DNA to roll my eyes and find this offensive but deep down, I silently agree. The Bay Area in general is beautiful, temperate, and has a unique culture. My European friends often say it has a charm that reminds them of home.''I love it for the ease of getting around on the BART system, how small and contained the city itself is, how picturesque, and how multicultural it is. Try a yoga or meditation class, head there during Pride or Outside Lands music festival, or see some live music. It’s the perfect place to jump off from or end up in when on a''road trip along the Pacific Coast Highway''too!''2. Bayfield, Wisconsin''Apostle Islands sailing – what a dream''Midwesterners are known for being friendly and they lived up to their reputation when I visited Bayfield, Wisconsin. It’s an artsy town with outgoing people, and it is small enough that it feels intimate yet big enough that there is plenty to do. Join a kayaking trip, a boat trip, or take a drive around to the various orchards.''There are plenty of beaches and quirky hangouts as well. If you love camping, there’s plenty of that and if you visit in the winter, the famous caves ice over, which looks incredible. If you’re into photography and the outdoors then you will absolutely love this little town on Lake Superior, the jumping off point for the''Apostle Islands''.''3. Moab, Utah''Dead Horse point''Moab is a mecca for outdoor enthusiasts. For those all about the camper van life, bouldering, hiking, and kayaking, Moab has it all going on. It’s where you’ll find Canyonlands and Arches National Parks as well as Dead Horse State Park. Basically it’s one of the most gorgeous areas on Earth with a high concentration of incredible rock formations and free campsites.''I easily met people just by hanging around the free campsites, the coffee shops, and while watching the sunset over Dead Horse point during my solo''American Southwest road trip''. I tend to find that when a place attracts people because of a common shared interest, especially something outdoorsy, it tends to be social. Moab is a perfect example of that.''4. Big Sur, California''Big Sur’s famous spot for whale watching, just north of Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park''I’ve looked on every continent and I still haven’t found anywhere as beautiful or majestic as Big Sur on the central coast in California. Though it’s had its fair share of disasters lately, when accessible, McWay Falls in Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park is one of the dreamiest waterfalls I’ve seen.''Big Sur is a fantastic place to unwind. If you want to meet others, the campsites can be pretty social. However when I’m out there, I find the best companions are the dolphins and whales jumping out of the water, the squirrels and deer on the trail, and the gorgeous Pacific Ocean. For more on my favorite state and national parks in California, check out my musings on''Alamo’s Scenic Drive.''5. Squaw Valley, California''Beautiful view from KT-22 at Squaw''“My go-to solo trip destination is Squaw Valley. During the winter, Squaw offers amble skiable terrain that is safe to navigate solo, in addition to a wide array of yoga classes and spa services perfect for wrapping up a long day of solo skiing or boarding.''Bailey at Squaw''The variety of restaurants at Squaw also cater to the solo female travel with many offering small intimate booths where you can curl up with a book and hot toddy while waiting for your meal. When the snow has melted, Squaw is still my favorite solo trip destination as it offers dozens of miles of hiking and mountain biking trails. For those who don’t feel comfortable hiking or biking on their own, there are multiple companies who offer guided tours.” – Bailey of''Feng Shui Mommy''6. Las Vegas, Nevada''Vegas, baby!''Las Vegas wouldn’t have been the first place that I would have expected to be awesome alone, but with so much to do, it’s actually perfect!''According to Noni, “I’ve traveled in North America by myself and I’ve never enjoyed anything more than Las Vegas!! I’m not American and didn’t expect much before, but when I arrived I knew it was so much better than any other location in Northern America!''Noni in Vegas''It’s very easy to meet people, everybody’s in a good mood and very open to meeting new people, there’s a bus that’s very popular and goes every couple of minutes which makes traveling easy and there’s so much to do, from cinemas and clubs to bowling and casino’s – Las Vegas is definitely my favorite place to travel as a female solo traveler!” – Noni of''Noni May''7. New Orleans, Louisiana''That iconic New Orleans look!''“I believe New Orleans is a perfect place for solo female travelers to visit. I have traveled there on my own and loved it. The city may be known for Bourbon Street and Mardi Gras, but there is a fascinating and rich cultural history to discover over a long weekend. There’s something for everyone in NOLA. For starters, I suggest staying in a boutique hotel on Royal Street, right near the allegedly haunted LaLaurie Mansion. While you’re there, tour cemeteries in the Garden District and the French Quarter, and sample the town’s famous beignets, po’ boys, and Pimm’s Cup.''Brittany in front of the Buckner Mansion from American Horror Story''Entertainment is plentiful and ranges from low key to raging parties. Learn about the dueling reign and lingering influence of France and Spain, or the city’s centuries-long history of voodoo and witchcraft. Or join the revelers in the Fruit Loop for a round of Hand Grenades. You’re sure to find exactly what you’re in the mood for and stay within your budget, too.''New Orleans is a large city, but easy to navigate on foot or by streetcar and bus. I never felt unsafe as a solo traveler because the streets are always bustling with tourists and locals, although it’s smart to practice precautions appropriate for travel in any big city.”\xa0\xa0– Brittany of''Transformed Thru Travel''8. Maui, Hawaii''Learn to surf!''I forgive you if you don’t think of Hawaii when you think of great places to travel solo, and I wouldn’t have either until I actually''went to Maui alone''last year. It was fantastic! There was so much to do, from a women’s surf school, to driving the''Road to Hana'', and joining snorkeling trips.''I thought I would be surrounded by honeymooners but I actually found that people were very outgoing and friendly, coupled off or not. I highly recommend Maui solo, much to my surprise!''9. The Big Island of Hawaii''Hawaii looking beautiful''“The Big Island of Hawaii is one of the best places for adventurous solo female travelers to visit. With volcanoes, world-class dive sites, interesting beaches, and miles of hiking trails, any girl with a penchant for the unexplored can never get bored.\xa0Solo travelers will love watching lava bubble at the top of Mauna Loa, snorkeling in Honaunau Bay, and visiting Uncle Robert’s night market — an eclectic market that serves fresh food and sells handmade clothing, beauty products, and decor.''Chantae doing her thing!''It’s easy to meet friends through activities, at the beach, and by going on day tours. The island is easy to navigate with a rental car as there is one main road that circles around the entire island. Most people consider going to the more tourist-heavy islands like Oahu, but the Big Island is an underrated spot that is well worth the trek over.” – Chantae of''The Salt Sirens''10. Seattle, Washington''International District Arch in Seattle''“Traveling solo in Seattle is great because it offers such a variety of activities that you can enjoy some solitude or plant yourself in an area teeming with activity (or even do both easily on the same day). Seattle offers neighborhoods with distinct character, food from any culture you can imagine, fantastic museums, and gorgeous public parks.''Robin and Ava canoeing!''A highlight of any trip to Seattle was experiencing the exceptionally talented local musicians that perform throughout the city on most nights. Jazz, experimental, rock, punk, metal, baroque, blues, hip-hop \xad– all there waiting for you. Public transit can get you most places during the day and taxis/ride-shares are readily available for late night adventures. It is very common for people to dine solo or listen to live music by themselves in Seattle, so no need to hesitate or feel awkward. Also, if you have heard of the “Seattle Freeze” don’t worry locals are actually friendly and helpful once you start the conversation. But no umbrellas please!” – Robin of''LETgo: Grab Opportunity''11. Cape Cod, Massachusetts''“Cape Cod is known as the tail of Massachusetts and a family-friendly beach destination in New England, but it’s also very well suited to solo female travelers. Why? Because it’s extremely safe, easy to get around, and downright beautiful. The Cape is just over an hour’s drive from Boston or Providence. You’ll definitely want to have a car so that you can freely explore its beautiful beaches. The ocean beaches are all lined with epic sand dunes, while the bay beaches host the most stunning sunsets (if you’re lucky enough to catch one at low tide, wow – the reflections off the puddles in the sand flats are something else!).''Lindsay in Cape Cod''Outdoor adventurers should tackle the Cape Cod Rail Trail, which runs for 25 miles from Dennis to Wellfleet. There are outposts all along the trail where you can rent a bike and cycle past cranberry bogs, marshes, and lakes. Or for slightly less-active adventures, hit up Wellfleet for the weekend flea market and drive-in movies, gay-friendly Provincetown for shopping and nightlife, and just about any restaurant for the Cape’s legendary clam chowder.” – Lindsay of''Frugal Frolicker''12. Minneapolis, Minnesota''Pretty, pretty Minneapolis''“I call Minneapolis the Stockholm of the Midwest. It’s filled with Swedish-Americans, gets very cold in winter (colder than Stockholm, actually), and has many opportunities to enjoy the fine arts.''Haylay in Minneapolis''“For a solo female traveler, it’s a perfect big city to visit. It’s safe to wander around, has beautiful architecture and natural vistas, provides great bike paths, and features plenty of fun shops like cafes and stationary boutiques.''When it comes to the outdoors, in the summertime it’s wonderful to explore all the green space and the hundreds of lakes nearby. And in the winter you have plenty of opportunities to go ice skating, skiing/snowboarding, and snowshoeing. No matter the time of year, Minneapolis has plenty on the calendar for you to enjoy.” – Hayley of''International Hotdish''13. Sun Valley, Idaho''Idaho really must be one of''the most beautiful states in the winter''time. I celebrated New Year’s there last year and I just loved the welcoming and friendly vibe.''It’s a quaint town with fantastic skiing, snowshoeing, naturally occurring hot springs, and locals who are more than happy to have a conversation with visitors and newcomers. Idaho is so underrated!''Though the USA is huge, and no list could ever do the wealth of places to see and experience justice, these are a few of our favorites.

It’s also a more competitive market. There are ways to jump ahead, though. I discuss them in''this post''if you want to step back, take a read, and come back to see this follow up.''In the video below I talk about the top ten things that you can do to make money from a blog, and this post includes all of the resources and links mentioned in the video. Have a look and by the time we’re done, you’ll be ready to make some scrylla:''As mentioned in the video, these steps are listed in a logical order based on how established you are. Again this is a long game rather than a quick overnight money-maker. However if you do it right, your blog can become a real job, and a resource that helps others at the same time:''1. Use your blog as a resume to get freelance writing work''My biggest source of income during the first couple years of my blog was freelance writing roles. At first they won’t pay all that well but you’ll be establishing yourself and in time you can charge more commensurate with your experience (and influence).''At first I was getting $50-$75 per article, which was enough to keep me going in cheap countries, and eventually I was able to charge more.''It helps a lot when a publication can see that you have some reach yourself to help share the article and get more views, and the more that you grow the easier it will be to get opportunities that pay better.''Writing articles not only helps with your bank account, but it gets you back links as well which is great for SEO! You can find a\xa0listing of resources here:''10 Goldmines for freelance Writing jobs''101 Places to Find Freelance Writing Jobs''20 Ways to Find Freelance Writing Jobs as a Beginner''2. Work as a virtual assistant for other blogs''Work from (almost) anywhere''Working for a more established blogger will help you understand how to become more effective with your own blog. These jobs mostly come from in-person networking.''At first, I think it’s great to attend industry events like''Travel Massive'', and even''TBEX'', if for no other reason than to network with other bloggers, to market your VA services, and to become aware of opportunities.''Or, try to just offer your services to a blogger you love. My full-time assistant reached out several years ago and asked if she could intern for me. Over the years, she’s become an essential part of my team. You would be surprised how many bloggers need help but don’t know where to look. Also consider the Facebook groups and industry events:''The Business of Blogging''Superstar Blogging’s Facebook Group''(''Requires Course purchase'')''Traverse Mingle events''3. Get into affiliate marketing''It’s never too early to start with affiliate marketing. The reason why I suggest getting into this early is because the pages that you put on your blog earlier will have more time to be indexed by Google. This is a long game, and you may not see the results from the fruits of your labor for a year or two, but this can become incredibly worthwhile.''For example, I wrote about''what to pack for Southeast Asia''four months into my blogging career and now it’s one of my most successful affiliate pages. It took a bit of time but it paid off. This is always true for me. I never really know how a post I write will do until much later, so I just keep trying!''You can become an affiliate for almost anything these days, so think outside the box. Here are a few great networks that I use:''Amazon''Ratuken''CJ''Etsy''Groupon''Whichever hotel booking and clothing sites you regularly use.''Whichever travel insurance you use.''The key is to only promote products that you truly love and use yourself. To successfully market products to your audience, their trust always has to come first. Check out''this post''for info on how to write a good affiliate post.''4. Place ads''Diversify!''Ad revenue is based on traffic so in the beginning, there’s not much point. However this will eventually be worthwhile and it’s something I really wish I had done about a year sooner!''At first it was hard to see my site with ads on it. I was so used to it looking the way it had for years, ad-free. However I believe that most readers don’t mind them (I haven’t had any complaints) and that your loyal fans will be happy to see you making money. I personally use''Mediavine''.''5. Sell your photos''A post shared by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Oct 26, 2017 at 9:06am PDT''Photography is a big part of travel blogging. I spent quite a while learning my way around the camera and practicing with editing. These days, photography is a huge priority when I travel. Having a visually appealing website is important, and since Instagram is such a huge marketing tool, it’s a great way to get paid work. Most of my paid work actually comes to me through''my Instagram''!''You can also''sell stock photos online''. Some people make a pretty good passive income this way. The rules are somewhat strict about what you can have in your photo, but if you are traveling and have a backlog anyway, it could be worth it. I can’t personally recommend it as I haven’t tried it, but if you have please let me know in the comments below if it works for you (or if not, tell us why!)''6. Monetize videos''Plenty of bloggers make videos here and there but I don’t see much crossover between blogs and''YouTube''. People seem to be very dedicated to one or the other but not both.''If you make great videos and are consistent, building up an audience on YouTube and putting ads on them is a great way to develop an income stream. This is also a long-game approach, like most of what I suggest on here, but if you build up a strong and consistent audience then you’ll have yet another passive income stream.''For more on how to get started on the right foot,''check out my review of the YouTube course that I used''.''7. Work on paid campaigns''Working hard in Kyrgyzstan''Eventually, when you have built up your audience and social media channels, you may have paid opportunities come your way. It might include product partnerships (like mine with''ZAGG'') or destinations (like mine with''Kyrgyzstan''), wherein you agree to a certain amount of deliverables in exchange for an all expenses paid trip and some cash.''This sounds like the dream, and it is, but it only makes sense if the destination and the campaign really make sense with your brand, and if you are capable of delivering everything that you promise.''As for how to get these opportunities, there’s no secret formula other than to, as Steve Martin famously said, “be so good they can’t ignore you.”''I rarely pitch, and I never really did. These opportunities tend to come directly to me. Once you get to a certain level, you’ll have more opportunities coming to you than you can accept, and if you have to be out cold pitching, it’s probably not quite time to be seeking these types of opportunities yet. Work on building your audience, building historical data to prove that you are worth spending money on, and putting out amazing content, and the work will follow, trust me!''8. Develop your own products''My buddy holding one of the books I wrote in Indonesia (while I took a swim).''The most successful entrepreneurs in this industry have their own products for sale.''It could be''a course'',''a book''or several,''tours'', or a whole host of other options. The more creative you can get the better!''It’s important to have a minimum viable audience before jumping in and creating a product, because otherwise there is the danger that you will spend all this time on product creation and not have any buyers. Your time is better spent building up an audience first, and marketing products to them later. Besides, without really being an authority on any particular subject, which requires time and establishing yourself, it’s kind of hard to sell products anyway!''9. Podcast''There are not many travel bloggers who have a podcast, but this is another great way to make money and contribute something meaningful that is not already incredibly saturated.''I believe this is actually a huge opportunity and if you can come up with something of quality that has not already been thought of, you can strike while the iron is hot. While I haven’t reviewed it, I fully trust Pat Flynn and would''take his course on podcasting''if I were to start one myself.''10. Become a public speaker''Public speaking is a great way to make money while also spreading awareness and establishing yourself as an authority. Like the previous few suggestions, this is something that will make sense to pursue after you have established yourself.''This is something I have not done a lot of, although I would love to get into it more. It’s a great way to add credibility to your brand.''Those are the best ways that I’m aware of to make cash from a travel blog. None of what I listed will get you rich quickly, but it is sustainable, based on providing something to people that is honest and of real value, and can help you build a lasting business that survives the test of time.''Most of all, innovate. Stay on top of the curve, keep working hard, and come up with new and exciting ideas. Put your energy into the things that you can do better than anyone else, and the money will follow.''Pin me!''Happy blogging!''READ NEXT: My Top 10 Tips on How to Start a Successful Travel Blog''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''For some of us, traveling solo, whether it’s the 1st or the 10th time, takes courage and a lot of prep talks to ourselves. For others, being a solo traveler is simply a part of who they are. Heather is one of those solo travelers who seems destined to do just that.''Here’s Heather’s story:''Tell us about yourself.''Heather in Phnom Penh''I am a self professed introvert,''bookworm'', history nerd and writer (Heather is a published author, and you can purchase her book''here'') with a splash of insatiable curiosity thrown in for good measure. Raised in Southern''California'', which feels like the center of the universe when your there, I wanted to get away from the dominate, often ‘shallow’ culture from a young age. At 19 I moved to Denver, Colorado and then Seattle, Washington, expanding my world in larger and larger circles until it came to include Europe, then Central America and Southern Mexico and most recently large swaths of Southeast Asia.''I am endlessly fascinated by the world we live in, and the mind-boggling diversity of it all, from nature to culture to language and religion, it is pure bliss for me to''learn about the world around me, and try to put all the pieces together''. Doing this for each country and region is what I love about travel, not to mention the different foods, celebrations, plant and animal species, and''literature from those places that I am visiting''. Also for me, it is very important to be cognizant of the local customs, to be respectful, and to remember''how lucky we are to be able to travel'', because a lot of the world does not have the opportunity or resources.''What motivated you to travel alone for the first time?''I don’t have the usual story of ‘my friend ditched me and now I am traveling alone’, actually, it feels like''going solo has always been a part of my existence''. I am an only child, so from, well, the beginning, I have had to entertain myself and keep my own company. It was a natural progression out from there.''Solo travel fits my personality type well'', and gives me plenty time to read and write, though I have met awesome people along the way and made a few life-long friends.''In Buddha Park, Laos''That being said, I was utterly terrified of my first trip abroad, to Norway to meet a friend I met while he was traveling in the US. I went around telling everyone how scared I was, and how I didn’t want to get on the plane, and by the time the travel day rolled around I was so tired of being scared of it that I actually got excited about it. I only spent a week with my friend in Norway, and traveled the rest of the time by myself, it didn’t seem like an option not to. I did start off alone in English speaking countries and moved on from there. That is when I feel like''I found my calling''.''Which misconceptions did you have about solo travel that you now realize were untrue?''I’m not sure if I ever thought enough about ‘solo travel’ to have misconceptions about it, since it sort of just happened for me, but I did used to view the world very differently. Before travel the world feels big and scary and unknown, and really, in the US we don’t even seem to think about the rest of the world that much, it’s just like this big, vaguely threatening grey area, something we hear about on the nightly news but don’t give much thought to past that, but I have been shown again and again, the basic humanity that we all share, and''the basic goodness of people'', too. I believe''what you get from the world is what you give to it'', so if you give hostility and fear, that is what is returned to you, but for all my travels, I have had an overwhelmingly positive experience. That’s not to say there aren’t problems or concerns in the world, but on a day to day level, people have shown themselves to be basically good. And that has been a refreshingly constant treat to experience.''Hanging out with the zebras in Brijuni, Croatia''What are some unexpected benefits of traveling alone?''For me, solo travel has been a huge, enormous confidence builder. It brings us to a whole new level of self-knowledge and self-awareness. It puts life into perspective, whatever that looks like; it defines priorities and boundaries, strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes, passions and aversions. And it''shows us what we are truly capable of''.''I used to be a very timid and insecure person, unsure of myself and my place in the world, but travel after travel, trip after trip, I learn more and more about myself, and realized that just because I don’t want the life that most have at home, does not make me broken or an outcast.''There is a place for everyone'', we just have to find it, and it may not be in our hometowns (or even in our home countries). I am fortunate to have the energy and funds to go out and find my strengths and my place in the world.''Where have you been that you think is perfect for solo female travelers?''I really enjoyed Slovenia and Croatia, the people are extremely kind and they are beautiful countries. For more tropical and ‘exotic’ Panama is great, especially as a kind of introduction to solo travel in Latin countries, there is a lot of infrastructure, many people speak English, and there is a solid tourist and ex-pat presence, which can be comforting especially for first-timers. Bali is good also, for many of the same reasons. And Scotland is one of my all-time favorites, and I hope one of my future homes, someday!''In Chiriquí, Panama''What are some obstacles you’ve had to overcome in order to make traveling a lifestyle?''There have not been many ‘social’ obstacles, for me they come more in the form of''feeling guilty about leaving''my (very small) family for extended amounts of time, and I tend to go off the beaten track, and to places that do not have a great reputation in the US (wrongly so) and this causes a lot of stress for them, but with video chatting that space and anxiety has been reduced greatly.''In Ubud, Bali''My own insecurity and lack of self-confidence are my biggest obstacles, though. Feeling like I am not talkative enough, or funny enough, or charming enough to have one of those adventures that show up so often and so beautifully on social media is usually what keeps me from trying. I would love more than anything to have the confidence and charisma to get that travel dream job, but''if I don’t believe I have self-worth, no one else will either'', and that is a theme which is repeated to me over and over. It’s something I am working on, but it takes time to unlearn all the negative and introduce (and really trust) the positive.''How did Be My Travel Muse help you?''Get the Guidebook for Solo Female Travelers!''Well for starters, it’s amazing and utterly inspiring that it even exists. That Kristin could build this whole beautiful little ‘empire’ is beyond amazing, a real dream come true. No doubt it came with a lot of hard work, but seeing what she did (and does) inspires me every day to keep working towards what I want, and that nothing is impossible.''It’s great that BMTM makes travel so accessible to everyone, it is inclusive and thought-provoking, and really takes the ‘scary unknown’ factor out of going places that we have never been. It’s an amazing resource that I wish I had when I first started out, but I am glad to be a part of this inspiring community now.''***''I truly enjoy learning stories of fellow solo female travelers from all walks of life, and I hope you enjoy them too!

I got exposure to their audiences and it also helps with valuable SEO back links. My''column on nomadicmatt.com''has been instrumental to my growth, and writing for others can do the same for you.''In the video, I talk about how to pitch and who to approach but also keep in mind the following:''If you want to know if someone has more traffic than you do, check out''similarweb.com.''To see what Google thinks of them, use''Open Site Explorer''.

Be helpful''When you sit down to write, think about how what you are putting out there is going to be beneficial to someone else. In the beginning, I didn’t have this in mind and I wrote more like a diary with my story. While I think some people found it entertaining, once I switched to an approach that was more helpful, things grew a lot more quickly for me.''I think it’s still very important to humanize your brand and to be relatable, and that is a fine balance between being personal and presenting facts.''Keep in mind that just by being you and by being vulnerable, you can be incredibly helpful.

Why are you doing it?''Always ask why''I was recently talking with a friend about growing his business online and I asked him, so why are you doing this? He was quick to answer that it was because he enjoyed it. That is definitely step one but it’s not the whole story.''Being able to articulate the reasons why the world needs what you’re putting out there is important. If you have a very clear why then you will be able to figure out the how. Here are some must-sees and reads to figure this out:''Simon Sinek’s''TED talk''And his books''Start with Why''and''Find Your Why''5. Don’t be afraid to spend money''TAKE MY MONEY!''I took a university class taught by a very rich, entrepreneur-turned-college professor who would often say, “The poor man spends more money on suits than the rich man.”''He meant that by springing for quality in the first place, you spend a lot less on replacing things that stop working because it was a cheap fix to begin with.''Many people who get into blogging are excited about it because of the low cost of doing business.

Hire People''Team work makes the dream work!''I understand that your blog is your baby and it is very hard to give up any kind of control. However the more I have hired people to help the more time I have to focus on the creative aspects of this blog.''For example, I really don’t need to learn the tech stuff because it would take me forever and I can hire someone to help with that. The same goes for graphic design. Surely there are things that you just don’t want to do that someone else could do better and quicker. If you possibly can, devote some resources to that.''I’ve asked for recommendations in the blogger Facebook groups for this (like the''business of blogging'', or the superstar blogging Facebook group) and my full-time assistant is a reader who reached out, asked if she could intern, and who has been with me for years in various roles.

Pick one or two things and master them''If you focus on just one thing you will do very well at that one thing but if you spread yourself too thin then nothing will get enough attention.''So where should you spend your time?

As soon as possible, stop paying attention to your competition''Focus on yourself''Most bloggers spend all day on Facebook and other social media platforms. They are designed to be addictive and they work! A year ago I deleted the Facebook app from my phone and it was the BEST IDEA EVER. Gone are the days of opening up my phone when I have one moment of downtime that expands to five or 10 minutes or even a half hour of scrolling through the news feed before even realizing it.''If you can break your social media addiction and stop paying attention to what everyone else is doing, you’re going to be so far ahead of the other game you’re going to leave them in the dust because you’re going to create so much extra time for yourself.

Don’t play games''It can be tempting to fake it, but when you do that, you’re not connecting with real people.''One new method is to join comment pods on Instagram where everyone agrees to like and comment on everyone else’s photo in the group. This helps everyone appear to be popular and get more paid work, based on lies. Trust me when I say, eventually these tactics will stop working.''It is really obvious to me when people are in comment pods. And if it is obvious to me, it is obvious to PR as well. Eventually the media side catches up because they hire people who are in the know to consult them. If you are known in the industry for playing games then nobody will hire you. It will be your undoing.''When I first started blogging, there were a lot of black hat techniques that people were using and most of those people are not around anymore or are not doing very well these days. If you have a real audience, even if it is small, that is much better than a fake one that will not pay off in the long run.''Remember, having 1000 true fans is so much better than having 100,000 fake followers.''10. Never stop learning''Don’t ever get too comfortable''There are so many free and cheap resources out there that can help you keep learning and doing well at this business. Here are a few that continuously help me:''The Smart Passive Income podcast''Entrepreneur on Fire podcast''Tools of Titans''by Tim Ferriss''Likeable Social Media''by Dave Kerpin''I realize that this is all a lot of reading, study, and time that I’m suggesting you spend on building this foundation, but this is the formula that worked for me and that worked for the entrepreneurs referenced in this post, all of whom are at the top of their game.''I fully believe that by using all of these tactics, you can reach success in your own unique way that will help you to stand the test of time and build a real business.

However, Malaysia ended up having so much to offer, it baffles me why it’s not as hyped a backpacking destination as its neighbors.''Malaysia is a unique country where you get to see different ethnicities coming together, living in harmony for the most part. The food is amazing and I honestly don’t think I’ve even tried half of what it has to offer during my six-week stay in Malaysia.

However, Kedah has its own charm. More and more locals now operate traditional Malay house style guesthouses that are surrounded by vast paddy fields, so if you want a rustic, authentic Malaysian experience, Kedah is worth stopping in for a night or two before heading over to Langkawi.

The main island is one of the more commercialized islands in Malaysia, but a cheap island hopping trip (which costs less than $15) will take you to the surrounding islands with crystal clear water and beautiful beaches. My tip is to stay on Cenang beach, as it is where all the good food is, but spend your time on the surrounding islands during the day.

The best one is from this roadside stall located at the corner of Siam Road and Anson Road. Expect long queues, mainly from the locals – which is always a good sign!''Delicious Laksa''Laksa''– Another noodle dish but with broth that is sour, spicy, and slightly sweet at the same time. Many would go to the popular stall located next to Kek Lok Si, but a local favorite is Laksa Bisu, located at Annex Market.''Rojak''– Basically a salad, but with crackers, fruits, nuts, and catch this: a thick sauce made of shrimp paste, chili, and lots of sugar.''Cendol''– a local favorite dessert, cendol is a humble bowl of shaved ice, kidney beans, condensed milk, and flavored flour noodles. It may sound strange but it’s perfect on a scorching hot day, though the best one located at the back alley of Lebuh Keng Kwee would require you to stand under the scorching hot sun while savoring it.''When you are stuffed to the point that eating is no longer possible, which I experienced often in Malaysia, take a walk along the streets of George Town and hunt for the Insta-worthy street art curated by Lithuanian artist, Ernest Zacharevic, or check out''the beautiful Kek Lok Si'', as well as the Peranakan mansions.''Stay'': I really liked my stay at Reggae Penang.

It’s vast and filled with various flora and fauna, and a wonderful spot for the adventurous. However, for something that is off the beaten path, check out''Royal Belum State Park''located in Perak, right below George Town. It offers a remote wilderness of about 117,500 hectares, and while getting there could be a challenge, it is worth every effort. You could swim in the lake, trek through the 130 million year old forest, and admire one of the biggest flowers in the world, the Rafflesia (from a distance, because they smell like horse piss, no really). If you are coming from George Town, there are daily buses that depart for Gerik town, and from there, your lodge will pick you up, or you can take a taxi.''Stay:''Belum Rainforest Resort''Cameron Highlands''Green & blue''I remember feeling grateful for the cold temperatures in Cameron Highlands, a great escape from a typically hot and humid Southeast Asia.

Here are some tips: instead of Jalan Alor and Chinatown, fill your tummy at Pudu’s ICC hawker food centre and Connaught garden food market (both accessible by Uber); instead of the mandatory shot in front of the Petronas Towers, check out the many rooftop bars with unblocked views of the entire city; for a fun night out, forget Changkat, go to TREC; to get away from the hustle and bustle, there’s an hour-long trek at Apek Hill, a local favorite. Finally, if you have the time, go watch a movie in any local cinema. After all, where else can you find three language subtitles on one screen?''Stay'': I have''fond memories''of''Reggae Mansion Kuala Lumpur''though it is a party place.''Tuxedo KL''offers a rooftop view of the city AND an infinity pool.''Chemerung Falls, Terengganu''300 meters of beauty!''Just two hours away from Kuala Lumpur, Chemerung is a beautiful, hidden waterfall tucked away in Terengganu.Chemerung waterfall is well over 300 meters tall with foaming waters cascading from the skies above, slipping down the craggy mountainside and pooling in the basins of rock below. That sounds like a good place to be, right?''Check out this guide''for more on how to get there.''Stay'': campsites are available if you are planning on trekking for 9 hours to the top.''The Dusun, Seremban''Here’s another cool spot that’s lesser known to tourists. The Dusun is a tropical rainforest resort located in Seremban, just about an hour away from the international airport. There are a total of 7 houses each with a different theme, surrounded by 4000 acres of virgin forest. Prices start at about $100 per night, which can be shared by 2 people. It’s great for couples or a group of friends. If you are traveling solo, ask around and see if someone would like to come along!''Stay'':''The Dusun''Malacca''Along the Malacca River''Some may compare Malacca to George Town, as both are heavily colonial influenced and offer delicious street food. However Malacca has more of a small-town vibe compared to George Town, and it is worth the visit. Street food wise, it’s famous for Portuguese egg tarts, chicken rice balls, Satay Celup, and coconut shakes. But as always, dig a little bit deeper and you will find some local favorites off the tourist radar:''Putu Piring'': a hemispherical snack made of coconut shreds and filled with coconut sugar. The best one is home made by an old couple at their house – 252, Jalan Tengkera.''Cockles'': Don’t be put off by the humble stall right next to a drain (the stall’s name translates as “drain cockles”). Take a seat and order a plate of fresh cockles and clams and slurp away with the local foodies – Longkang Siham, Jalan Bunga Raya, Madam King.''Durian Cendol'': If you have yet to give the infamously stinky Durian a try, start with a Durian cendol! Then you can decide which side you belong (personally I’m a lover and advocate of it)- 115, Jalan Merdeka.''Taibak'': A traditional Nyonya cold dessert, this is a mixture of shaved ice, pandan infused syrup, rice flour noodles, and black grass jelly cubes – the stall is right next to Wesley Methodist Church.''Stay'':''Nomaps''offers nice and clean dorms.''This spacious suite''costs only about $70 per night!''Tioman Island''The simple life''From Malacca, you can take a bus that departs daily to Mersing Jetty, and take a boat to yet another off the beaten path place on the Peninsula – Tioman Island. Perhaps due to the country’s Islamic culture, Malaysian islands exude a laid back, peaceful atmosphere, as opposed to the party vibe of many Thai islands. On Tioman Island, restaurants open and close as they like, and there are more basic huts with no WiFi or water heaters (A.K.A. perfection) than resorts.''Scuba diving is fantastic'', as you can potentially see sharks, turtles, and colorful corals. It is also a great place to get your diving license, so you can explore deeper in the next stops!''Stay'':''A beachfront, simple chalet''is always a good idea.''Santai Bistro Resort''costs less than $50 per night.''Pemangil Island''Pemangil Island is possibly the Peninsula’s best kept secret (and here I am, letting it out…). It’s an incredible place to snorkel or dive in, the water is amazing, the beach is nice and clean, and the last time I checked, there’s only one resort on the island. Rock cliff climbing is a popular sport here. The locals are also happy to show you around the village, and you will get a glimpse of how the locals live.''Stay'':''Lanting Beach Resort''Mount Kinabalu''An experience of a lifetime''This is one heck of a climb, but oh-so worth it! I did it in one day but unfortunately this is no longer permitted. A minimum of 2D1N is now required to climb to the peak of Mount Kinabalu, however this allows you to arrive at the peak at sunrise, which must be an unforgettable treat.''I wrote about my personal experience'', and updated it with the latest information on how to get there and what to expect.''Stay'': I stayed at''Kinabalu Mountain Lodge'', which is only 2km from the park entrance.''Sipadan Island''The gypsea tribe of Sipadan Island''This is yet another diving paradise of many in Malaysia, but trust me, this one is officially one of the best dive sites in the world, according to multiple sources including''CNN Travel''. I can also attest, given that after completing 150 dives, I still''rank Sipadan right at the top of my best diving experiences''. Sipadan limits daily divers and requires a permit to dive, so book in advance – I’d suggest at least one month ahead, or just as soon as you’ve booked your flight tickets to Sabah. Another tip is to stay on Mabul, where you get to see the sea gypsea tribe.''Stay'': I dived and stayed with''Scuba Junkie'', and loved my experience with them. If you don’t mind staying a bit further away, look for''accommodation options in Semporna''.''Sulug Island''This is the farthest island from Kota Kinabalu, perfect for those in search of an off the beaten path adventure. It is the least visited island of the 5, and offers little to no facilities on the island. Spending a few hours on Sulug should make you wonder if you are made for the Robinson Crusoe life.''Stay'': While most people do day trips to Sulug, you can also camp on the island.''Kinabatangan River''This is a tricky one to get to, but well worth the effort (have you noticed the pattern?). From Kinabalu, you can take a 6-hour long bus to Sandakan, the second largest town in Sabah. As most private cruise companies and lodges offer transfers, there’s virtually no public transport available to Sukau (closest town to the river) other than a minibus that leaves after lunch time daily.''As for the river cruise, there are a few companies offering 1-3 days trips. Most lodges double up as cruise companies, which make things easier.''Stay'': for something more affordable and rustic, check out''Lodge Paganakan Dii Tropical Retreat''(less than $50 per night).''Nature Lodge Kinabatangan''is the most popular accommodation in that area.''Kudat – the Tip of Borneo''Is this what heaven looks like?''I still remember the beaches at the Tip of Borneo fondly, with their white sand, little purple flowers, incredibly clear blue water, and not another soul or a single piece of trash in sight. It’s an underrated beauty without many other tourists, but it’s so worth checking out. You can get yourself there by renting a motorbike in Kota Kinabalu.''Stay'': There were just about 3 or 4 guesthouses around when I was there in 2013, but you can now''pick from a few resorts''as well as''Airbnbs''.''Pin me!''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''A few years ago, I interviewed an Australian girl who was at that time, traveling around the world with her family while getting her education from School of Life. At 13 years old, she exuded a maturity and confidence that blew me away.''Réka back in 2015, when I first interviewed her''Since then I’ve featured many other female travelers from all walks of life, but I thought of her often and wondered how she was doing. Recently, I reached out to her and was once again completely blown away by her achievements, especially at such a young age. Now she’s a published author who has traveled more than I have before even hitting age 17! Whether you’ve heard about her or not, Réka’s story is worth a read:''Update us on everything that’s been going on since we last spoke!''Close to 3 years later, all grown up!''It was just a few weeks after''my first guest post went live on Be My Travel Muse''that along with my parents and twin brother, we embarked on walking the 500 Mile Camino de Santiago del Norte pilgrimage through Spain. It was along this 38 day adventure that saw us hike across some of the most breathtaking countryside in the world that I decided to return to and rework the draft of my novel''Dawn of the Guardian''(DOTG).''After completing the Camino we embarked on a European roadtrip through France, Italy, Monaco and Spain, and as the summer months began to draw to a close, we returned to our travel base on the Mediterranean coast where after three months of reworking''DOTG''’s draft, on the cusp of the Northern Hemisphere’s autumn, we packed up our bags and embarked on an odyssey of adventures through Russia, India and''Malaysia'', finally returning us to Australia (our home country) for the first time in 4 and a half years. And it would be here that we would finally get to publish''Dawn of the Guardian''.''4 months later, I was standing in a little independent book store in my home city of Melbourne, Australia, surrounded by friends and family and complete strangers, self-publishing''Dawn of the Guardian''. It was quite a surreal realisation, knowing that just 5 months after completing the Camino, I was bringing my dream of becoming a published author to life.''From there we returned to our travel base in Spain via an expedition to''China''and embarked on''Dawn of the Guardian''’s International Book Tour, a nine-month journey that saw us travel over 50,000 kilometres to schools, libraries, bookstores and communities of learning all across the UK,''USA'',''Canada''and Mexico.''But it was while we were in New Jersey, on the cusp of beginning the East coast stretch of the North American leg of the tour that I was actually approached by Hungary’s leading Publishing House and Bookstore Chain with an offer to translate, publish and distribute my book in Hungary.''Réka and her family at the Great Wall of China''This brings me to where we have been for the last 4 months, in Budapest, where we now at the end of four months of promotional tours, media appearances and interviews throughout Hungary and Transylvania.''It was a journey getting there too, one of a pretty epic road trip through the breathtaking Highlands of Scotland (one of my favourite places in the world), England, France, Belgium, Luxembourg,''Germany'', the Czech Republic and Slovakia. But it’s been really nice having a base for the last couple months here in Budapest as I’ve been writing''Dawn of the Guardian''’s sequel and it’s really helped''having one place to be able to return to''and call home (if even just temporarily).''Our upcoming travel plans sees us travel to Israel and then Jordan for the holiday and New Year time period before we embark on another road trip back across Europe from Hungary to Spain where we will be spending the months leading up to April, which is when my grandmother, for her 70th birthday, will be walking the 940 kilometre Camino de Frances. We will be joining her!''Wow, you wrote a book! Tell us about it, your inspiration, and how you managed to write it while being a student and traveling.''Dawn of the Guardian''Dawn of the Guardian''is a fantasy adventure fiction novel inspired by our own travels through the heart of Andalusia where I came face to face with my main character in the town of Arcos de la Frontera. Now it’s worth mentioning that my main character is actually a two and half year old Patterdale Terrier dog called Fūko whom I met one adventurous eve when he came into the house with muddy paws and all the mystique of a dog leading a double life. Fūko is chosen to be the Guardian, an ancient and revered role in the universe and he is thrust into the thick of an adventure that spans the vastness of time, the darkness of space and the dimensions of reality.''While this story is great for kids ages 10 and up, I believe this tale has a little bit for everyone, particularly adults who love a good story. Also inspired by our experiences in the sacred red centre of Australia, the culture of the Aboriginal People as well as the esoterica and mysticism of my experiences in Spain,''Dawn of the Guardian''tackles an assortment of different issues including not being afraid of failure, the dualism of good and evil and ultimately the power of forgiveness.''I always loved fantasy adventure stories and sitting on a bus, speeding past the Rock of Gibraltar, reflecting on my experiences over the past couple of days in Spain it was as if everything suddenly clicked.''As for how I was able to write this book as a student and while traveling I’ll start by saying that while it’s not impossible, it can be a bit tough writing on the road and so I took advantage of the fact that we were to be renting a temporary travel base in Budapest for a year and over the course of 9 months of being in one location I was able to complete the first draft of the book just a few weeks before my 13th birthday, June 2014.''I’ll also say that not being confined to a traditional school setting gave me the freedom to be able to pursue my passion without the added stress of having to spend all my extra time on things like homework. Being world-schooled I was able to give all my attention and effort over to my dreams and delve much deeper into the process of bringing a book to life from scratch especially when it came time to publish the book.''After writing to over 50 agents and publishers and being met with “Oh you wrote a book.” “Aw you’re twelve.” “How cute!” it got quite discouraging. But it was soon after that I received some much needed feedback from a prominent UK publishing imprint that restored the confidence in myself to know that this story was worthy of being read and worthy of being published.''We even received an offer from them to publish the book, but due to the fact that we would have to do all the marketing, we decided that we were going to go full steam ahead with self-publishing. Together with my family we became publishers. We created our own imprint. We sourced our own editors, typesetters, illustrators, designers and printers. I learnt what it takes to be a publisher and everything that goes into taking a manuscript and turning it into a hard bound copy ready to read. And I can honestly say that after everything on the long road to publication, I can never look at a book the same way again.''How do you think your life is different from a typical teen back at home?''A path less traveled''Last week, I was privileged to be invited to one of my Hungarian friend’s “Szallag-Avató”, which, translated, was a wonderfully elaborate Prom, where the students all learned a series of dances that varied from ball-room, hip-hop to interpretive dance and they all performed these dances for everyone. It was an experience-and-a-half and traveling doesn’t always necessarily afford us the opportunity to participate in something like this.''However, I feel there are some real advantages to the opportunities of learning by living life through experiences, ones that have played out over six continents, many cultures and the almost countless wonderful and inspirational stories of the many beautiful people we have met. I can deeply respect and appreciate that our kind of life is not for everyone, but I also feel a strong gratitude for the choices my parents had the courage to make, as this underscores some of the key differences between us and perhaps a lot of teens back home.''My classroom is that in-the-moment inspiration that beckons me to dig deeper to understand a concept, or learn a lesson that is essentially and inherently linked to what interests me and what fuels my passion. It is inspired by the location, people and experiences that we are immersed in at that very moment. It doesn’t require a test at the end, but it absolutely compels you to give it your fullest attention, because it is relevant, exciting and has meaning.''Perhaps this is the biggest difference:''I am empowered to make essential choices about my life''that affect me directly, based on what truly inspires me.''Also, I love the fact that we are traveling together as a family. Most teenagers my age cannot wait to get away from their parents. I love the opportunities we have to be together and learn from each other. While traveling, we get so many opportunities to meet and connect with many other teens around the world. This is great as we get to see life from their perspective.''It may be that many teens living at home don’t get the opportunity to see these things upfront, perhaps their parents shelter them from these situations. I can only speak from our perspective, but I can say that these experiences, forged out of travel and all we had learnt so far, have gifted my brother and I the understanding that together as a family, we are the measuring stick of our own lives and as long as we are''investing ourselves in something that has meaning''and creates value to world in which we live, everything will work out just fine.''How do you feel about the world/other cultures/the experience you’ve had? Do you think that traveling from such a young age has totally changed your life path?''Réka in Whistler, Canada''I feel that every single person on this planet has a story and that it’s so very important to be able to share these stories. Stories are how we learn from each other, how we become better human beings and it’s so important to be able to have the patience to listen as well as to share. Getting to know other people and their cultures has been an integral part of my life and learning.''The world is such a big place''and the richness of travel for me lies in taking off my own shoes and stepping into someone else’s and seeing their world through their eyes. It’s these experiences that have shown me the interconnected nature of everyone’s stories and I think one of the most important things I’ve learnt throughout all my travels is that no matter who we are or where we all individually come from, the struggles we face need not be separate because our stories never are.''Anyone who travels is bound to gain a new experience, to''gain a new perspective''and I can say from experience that travel is what has undoubtedly given us as a family the opportunity to learn and grow together everyday while also simultaneously presenting us with the challenges and hurdles that have ultimately made us stronger, more adaptable and open to change in the world around us.''I was 10 when we started traveling the world. Now my twin brother and I are 16. We’ve traveled to 41 countries across 6 continents and we’ve been on this journey together as family for 6 years. I think it’s safe to say I didn’t have a conventional childhood. Nothing about growing up on the road or traveling and learning from the world around us is considered ‘normal’ in everyday society and yet this lifestyle has given me the best experiences of my life. Travel has given me the inspiration to start my travel blog''Dreamtime Traveler''and write my book. My best friendships have been made while traveling and they’re friendships that I never would have made had my parents not had the courage to take that giant leap of faith and sell everything we had and then with all but a few suitcases and backpacks take their family life out onto the road. I’m aware that I’ve been given a very unique chance to live my life in a manner that most people believe could only ever be available to them in a dream and I will be grateful for that chance forever.''Please share an amazing experience you’ve had since we last spoke. The opener to the highlight reel of your past few years.''Reka at Horseshoe Bend''My harness digs into my ribs as the wind whistles like a crazed teapot, about to simmer over. We’re all standing at the top of a creaking wooden launch pad on the edge of an ancient wonder, inside the embrace of Mehrangarh Fort, one of the most majestic works of architecture in all of Rajasthan and a shining amber star amidst Jodhpur’s famed blue buildings. The sun is slowly boiling down to a rich caramel, casting its light across us all as we prepare to take a leap into the golden sky.''All at once the sunset transports me back through the memories of our last 3 weeks in India, the crazy and chaotic ride that has seen us visit 14 cities amidst 12 overnight train rides in what has been a cacophony of sights and smells and sounds. I can see my camel galloping across the desert dunes, the grains of Jaisalmer’s desert sands stinging against my skin. I can see the stars from that night, diamonds glittering against a dark velvet sky. I remember the light reflecting against the emerald green of the sacred Ganga River and the spires of the Taj Mahal rising into the sky like an ivory angel. I can feel the uncertainty I once felt at the beginning of this adventure, standing a mere six hours from Delhi’s tarmac, frozen in Moscow. Now I stand at the edge again, my head slowly eclipsing my heart.''The zip-line cord quivers in the breeze, mimicking my heart beat. My fingers shake in anticipation as I take the final step that lies between solid ground and the wide open air. I realise that this leap means something far more to me than overcoming a simple theme park-esque anxiety. This jump is mirrored in the lack of self confidence I held in myself, as fragile as the delicate amber carvings etched upon Mehrangarh’s walls.''When we first arrived in Delhi it was hard to ignore the hundreds of people whose eyes followed our every shadow. I can honestly say that it was a bit overwhelming at first. After all, to be scrutinised is often part of someone’s greatest fears. For when you look at a stranger a tiny bit closer, when you see them without their disguise, unable to camouflage in a foreign place where they stand out like a sore thumb… you can often see the simple truth.''It made me angry. I didn’t want to be stared at. I didn’t want to share any part of me at all. So I put up a barrier. My own little protective shell to shield me from the dust and dirt and the deluge of looks. But it was in the holy city of Pushkar, where we encountered everything from blessings to ‘bang cookies’, drugs offered to us by the owner of a well-reputed rooftop restaurant, that I realised that the spectrum of the human experience is so vast, that there may not even be enough colours in existence to depict it accurately, even here in India, vibrant, rainbow jewel of the east that it is.''Walking down the streets there in Pushkar we came upon a man whose business was mending shoes. While at first we refused his services out of sheer habit we realised that my brother’s shoes were indeed on their last legs (no pun intended) and fixing them would actually be of great help to us. As the man sewed and glued and hammered we started talking. He shared his story. We shared ours. There in the hot afternoon breeze we all felt a connection that transcended a simple monetary exchange and in that moment I felt it. In my own heart I knew that there was nothing to fear. That there was never anything to fear. For the true richness of India lies in every person’s story. Everyone we met along those three life changing weeks, they all took me by the hand and showed me it was ok to trust. It was ok to be vulnerable. That we are all human. And that when you meet the eyes of someone in a bustling crowd filled with hundreds there is no callousness, but only curiosity, nothing but a shared want of understanding, and that one stare can last a lifetime.''The truth is, nothing can truly prepare you for the moment when you step outside the sliding doors of the airport in India, when the morning breeze grazes your skin, when your lungs inhale the thick smoky air of New Delhi, when the burning sun beats down upon your back and a hundred set of eyes turn to scrutinise you. Because then it’s no longer a far off dream, wrapped in a gauze of breathtaking pictures, awe-inspiring blog posts and expert packing lists.''It’s real.''There is nothing to do but take that first deep, albeit smoky breath, open your tightly clenched eyes and soar!''And so with the twilight rising above the fort and Jodhpur’s blue city beckoning below, I leap off the wooden platform. I start to gather momentum until I am hurtling through the sky like a shooting star. I close my eyes as the word India alights my tongue. I can hear the language. I can see the melting sun. I can feel the adrenaline. Together, in my eyes, it is beauty. A thrill of exhilaration, eclipsed by a crescendo of flower petals, falling to my feet. I realise that everything here is not a cacophony of sights and smells and sounds. It is and always was, a symphony.''What are your aspirations for the future?''Réka at the Isle of Skye''I’d love to see''Dawn of the Guardian''’s trilogy re-published by a major publishing house across the USA, England and Australia. I’d love to see the fan base we have cultivated continue to grow across North America, the UK, Hungary and beyond. I’d love to see''Dawn of the Guardian''made into a film. This is one of the bigger dreams but I like to think it’s growing ever larger on the horizon with every passing day that the story is being read and shared.''But the biggest thing in writing this book was that I wanted to be able to inspire other writers, young and old to tell their stories and follow their passions. To know that their stories are worthy of being read and to not be afraid of taking that first step out into the great unknown. The step that is necessary on the road to bringing our dreams to life. If anyone can find even the tiniest bit of inspiration in my story then I know that one of my biggest dreams will already have been fulfilled.''You gave a Ted Talk! What is it about?''I did! It was really exciting to be able to return to the Tedx Youth Budapest stage after 4 years, this time a full presenter and share my talk on The Power of Stories.''While I also shared what inspired me to start writing, my own experiences of travelling the world and my journey to publishing Dawn of the Guardian, what I wanted to be able to do in essence was encourage people to tell their stories. To be courageous. To be themselves. To not let the words of the media or the words of others be their only opinions of the world. To go out and see what this beautiful planet of ours has to offer for themselves. To go and dream.

I asked a few of my friends who are familiar with the area to make recommendations before I went and ended up visiting five different cenotes:''Gran Cenote''100 pesos, very popular''Photo by''my BFF Paige''This is a very popular one, but by arriving right when it opened at 8 AM I didn’t have to battle the crowds to enjoy this cenote. Later on in the day when I drove by, the parking lot was buzzing with cars and people. I would highly recommend getting to this one first and visiting the others on this list after.''While the cenote does feel very commercial with a big deck built on top, which initially turned me off, after spending some more time there, swimming around, and finding another little hidden area, I decided that it was quite beautiful and I do recommend visiting. Just go there early!''Choo-ha''55 pesos, less popular (but no less amazing)''Out of all of the cenotes, I liked this one the best because it felt the least commercial. The baby blue water is a nice temperature and I just loved looking around the inside of the beautiful cave. In contrast to the Gran Cenote with its open ceiling, this one has a very small opening at the top and a narrow staircase down.''This is one of a trio of cenotes out near Coba,\xa0 so I visited all three because we were there anyway, right?''Tamcach-ha''55 pesos, less popular''I was struck by how deeply blue the water is in this cenote. It also has two platforms that you can jump off of into the water. I only realized mid-fall that the higher of the two really is quite high, so make sure you’ve got your form right before you hit the water!''I give my pencil dive a 7 out of 10 but let me tell you, after nursing a sore neck the next day I wish it had been a 10 out of 10! Keep the good form, people!''Multum-ha''55 pesos, less popular''Out of the three cenotes near Coba, this one was the least amazing but it was also the biggest, so there’s plenty to swim around and to see. The stalactites on the ceiling are also quite impressive.''Bonus: Suytun near Valladolid''70 pesos, very popular''Suytun is quite a drive away from Tulum but out of all of the cenotes I visited, this one was the dreamiest-looking. The platform is partially submerged under the water and walking out to it to be illuminated by a hole in the ceiling feels like you’re walking on nature’s cat walk.''I woke up at 6 AM to get to the cenote right when it opened so that I could get photos without anybody in them. I’m still not clear on whether it opens at 8 or 9 AM. They opened the gate for us at 8:20 and we were the first ones there. I think with even one or two other people in the shot it wouldn’t be nearly as special. Also, if you want to swim in the cenote you are required to wear a life jacket, which takes it off of the swimming list for me! Can’t stand wearing those orange abominations.''There are dozens of other cenotes in the vicinity of Tulum, and if you expand to the entire Yucatán peninsula, surely there are hundreds. However if you only have time to visit the ones I’ve mentioned here you will see a nice variety. Other honorable mentions include Jadin de Eden, Sac Atun, and Casa Cenote.''2. Laguna Kaan Luum''50 pesos (extra 300 to fly a drone), moderately popular''This Laguna looks a bit like the''Blue Hole in Belize''. It’s a sinkhole in the jungle with some very shallow water followed by some incredibly deep water. The deep area is roped off to swimmers but you can scuba dive into it. While it is a nice contrast to all of the cenotes, I find that it’s more interesting from the air than down on the ground.''Not as amazing down here.''It’s a pretty cheap activity at only 50 pesos, however if you want to fly your drone there it will be an extra 300 pesos. It''is''unique, though, and was kind of worth it. This is another one that I visited right when it opened at 9am to get some shots of it without a bunch of people in them. It worked out. The early bird gets the worm in Tulum!''3. Tulum Ruins''70 Pesos, Very Popular''Evidence of the Mayan civilization is all over this peninsula and down into Guatemala and Belize, though the Tulum location was of significant importance to the empire as a religious and ceremonial center. The location is also stunning, set on a backdrop of the beach with dazzling blue water and white sand. While not as impressive as Tikal in Guatemala or Chichen Itza much further west, both of which are astounding due to their respective sizes, it’s certainly more convenient to check out the Tulum ruins.''If you do go, make it early. I deviated from my usual plan of visiting popular attractions first thing in the morning and regretted it! By midday it is unbearably hot and I was sharing the ruins with hoards of other people. Make this one of the activities to prioritize early in the morning if you want to check out the ruins without tons of other people around.''4. Explore the jungle''The beach in Tulum is absolutely gorgeous with its white sands and gorgeous blue, bath temperature water. But the jungle is quite magical as well. Before moving to a beachfront hotel, I stayed in a little hut in the jungle and it was so nice falling asleep to the sounds of all of the animals, and seeing the stars so dazzling and brilliant in the sky.''Plus, if you stay off of the road that goes towards Coba where many of the jungle hideaways are, you will already be on the stretch of road that leads to most of the cenotes. Spend some time in the jungle, even if it’s just wandering around at the cenotes, exploring at your resort, if they have a jungle path, or sleeping in a jungle hut.''5. Get in the water''There are so many things to do in the water in Tulum! You can do standup paddle surfing, scuba diving, snorkeling, kayaking, or hop on a catamaran.''I also really like that this beach is still laid-back and there aren’t tons of high-rise hotels and constant paragliders and speedboats. There is still some peace and tranquility.''6. Eat Some local food''There are two kinds of food on offer in Tulum: food meant for tourists with an English menu and high prices and the little, unassuming local eateries that are more authentic and tastier, tbh.''I was so excited to eat street tacos when I got to Mexico that the first thing we did, straight from the airport, was to pull over on the side of the road outside of the airport when we saw a taco stand. Street tacos are so cheap, delicious, and fresh. If you’re hesitant about the whole affair, go to a stand that has lots of patrons. It wouldn’t be super popular if it made people sick.''There’s also a fantastic fruteria in the town of Tulum called''Huerto del Eden''with fresh juices, hand-ground coffee, plus cooked to order eggs. All of the produce is fresh from local farms, it is locally run, and the guys working there are so nice and accommodating. Plus, it’s authentic and the price matches.''7. Get into the hippie vibe''Tulum is a hippie haven. It must be a combination of the area being sacred to the Mayans, the laid back atmosphere of the beach, the natural beauty, and the jungle vibes. There’s just something about it that calls the type of people who are into the spiritual side of life.''If you’re curious about this kind of thing, the beach area of Tulum is the perfect place to try something new, like a cacao ceremony (''this yoga studio''hosts them from time to time), yoga classes,''holistic health offerings''and meditation classes. Just explore and see where your open mind can take you.''Where to Stay''TRS Yucatan in nearby Akumal''I split my time in Tulum between a luxury hotel on the beach and a little hut in the jungle. It was perfect, and allowed me to get the best of both worlds:''Hotel:''The TRS Yucatan''in Akumal has the dreamiest pool, a gorgeous white-sand beach, and the world’s best breakfast. I did a little tour of the breakfast spread and room in the video above. The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and it’s all inclusive without being cheesy!''Jungle Hut:''The Lumapi Jungle Eco Lodge''is in the perfect spot if you want to visit the cenotes, plus you get a chance to fall asleep to the jungle noises and get a secluded experience – with an outdoor shower! The huts are made from materials that already exist in the jungle and they run on solar power. The owners are so lovely as well, and the vibe is just amazing. I stayed for two days and thought it was perfect. (if you’re new to Airbnb you''can get a discount here'')''How to get around''It’s possible to take collectivos, taxis, or tours, but nothing will give you the flexibility of renting a car and driving yourself. We were able to cover so much ground and to get everywhere first thing in the morning because we drove ourselves.''Driving in Mexico wasn’t scary or all that different from driving in LA, where I grew up. Just go slow, drive defensively, and watch for speed bumps in the towns. Car rentals are dirt cheap (just make sure that insurance is included in your booking or they’ll try to charge you extra for it when you pick up the car!), and if you get a model that’s good on gas, it’s a cheaper alternative to tours or taxis.''Tulum is a laid back paradise in the Riviera Maya. I tend to love places like this because, well, I fit right in. This is much more my speed than the mega resorts of Cancun.''Though I was heartbroken to have had to leave what felt like way too soon, I was pleased to find that there were so many things to do in Tulum. I had no idea before I went how many amazing options would be pulling me in so many directions. It’s a lovely thing to visit a place and immediately start making a list of things to do when you return, but next time with much more time on your hands.''If you’re visiting Mexico, make sure Tulum is on your list.''Pin me!''Love beaches?

I realized I never really answered that question, so I sat down to write out my history – the wins, the struggles, the things that worked and the personal journey as well. Nearly 5000 words later here it is, right from the humble beginning. I hope that if you’re considering blogging too or just looking to connect more, that this is helpful to you:''I was sitting in my cubicle in 2011, three years after I began my job in finance. After years of trying, I’d finally closed a big deal and yet I felt empty instead of excited. I was 25 years old and confused.''I had a prestigious job in mergers and acquisitions – one I was grateful for considering I’d been hired in 2008, shortly after the infamous failure of Bear Stearns.''I worked crazy hours but at least I had money, right? I had a nice car, fancy purses, and a relationship with a man who wanted to marry me, and yet I was miserable. I know, cue the violin playing the world’s saddest song.''But maybe you know what I mean with this dissatisfaction, perfectly summed up by Tyler Durden from Chuck Palahniuk’s''Fight Club:''Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.''That day in my cubicle as I read this quote by him I felt understood.''Growing up, society told me that as long as I got As in school and worked hard and earned a lot of money, I could buy things and that these things would make me happy. At some point, I opened my eyes, bleary from the deep sleep that I had been in, and asked,''how in the world does a purse make a person happy?''How does a car that impresses a perfect stranger for a millisecond while he drives by make me better? There''had''to be something else.''Around that time a friend sent me a link to nomadicmatt.com. I was amazed that he was traveling the world and doing it very cheaply. Up until that point I figured only trust fund babies could do that. I looked at my savings after paying off my remaining student loans and the retirement account contributions and realized that I could probably go for a year or even two in Southeast Asia. Once that seed was planted it grew like a vine, rooting itself in my consciousness, completely taking over my mind. There was another option in life and it was available to me.''But what it would take to make this happen was drastic. I knew that I didn’t want to leave for only a month and then come back to things the way I’d left them. I wanted to be completely free, and that meant getting rid of my job and apartment, and maybe even my relationship, too.''Things were already on their way towards an end for my boyfriend and I.\xa0This was hard for me. I sang sad songs in the car and the shower (Mostly Taylor Swift TBH). I questioned''if anyone would ever love me like that again''. I wondered if I was trading stability and the American Dream for nothing more than a pipe dream. I felt like an island, because I didn’t want to hurt anyone with these thoughts and I didn’t trust anyone with them either, least of all myself.''After about six months of inner turmoil, what ifs, interrogating and fighting with myself, and a burning desire to just know that everything would be OK, in a moment of clarity I realized:''I’m not going to let myself live in a cardboard box. There is always a way to begin again.''So I finally did it. I let everyone in on the secret, quit my job, bought the plane flight, and set the wheels in motion.''Year One: It Begins''Over the next two months, freshly unemployed and with lots of time on my hands, I spent nearly all day every day poring over travel blogs, reading the comments, trying to glean information about how they were doing it. I bought Nomadic Matt’s book,''How to Make Money with Your Travel Blog'', which at the time included two free calls with him.''During one of our calls, Matt, then a stranger to me, told me that the Travel Blog Exchange conference (TBEX) was coming up in Denver a couple weeks later and that it would behoove me to go.''The first Instagram photo I ever posted:''The first Instagram photo I ever posted''A post shared by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''May 3, 2012 at 12:23pm PDT''Networking was and still is an important part of getting ahead in this industry, and this was a chance for me to do that. It was going to cost me since I wouldn’t benefit from any deals or early bird pricing, but I trusted his opinion, and booked the trip.''This was in June, two months after I had bought the domain and put exactly 3 blog posts up on my website. But even though I was green, simply being around people in the industry allowed me to make myself known enough to implement my next strategy: Guest blogging.''In Denver:''A post shared by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Jun 15, 2012 at 9:00am PDT''Following the conference, I spent the next couple of months refining the design of the site and networking more. I commented on other bloggers’ posts in a conversational tone, engaged with them on Twitter, and took note of who accepted guest posts. I think an important part of this was that it didn’t look like I was just fishing for links or eyeballs. My comments came from the heart and showed that I had really read their posts.''My favorite blog to follow was''Bacon Is Magic'', since at the time, Ayngelina’s story of leaving a boyfriend to travel solo was quite similar to mine.''I started to write regularly on my blog about''how I handled my healthcare''and immunizations and''how I sold off everything I owned on craigslist in the span of a week'', and shared my story about''why I had decided to buy a one-way ticket to Bangkok''and take a chance on traveling. It was quite a vulnerable share at the time and I knew that my friends would be reading it. I remember being super nervous to publish it, just as I have been many times since when sharing the more private parts of my life.''In September, I took off with my one-way ticket and a carry-on backpack full of newly purchased items and my trusty old DSLR camera. I was terrified.''A final picture of California before heading to the airport:''A post shared by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Sep 26, 2012 at 4:31pm PDT''But everything ended up being okay. I fell into a rhythm and within days I was on a pink cloud, more blissed out than I’ve ever been. I’d found my happy place and it was in a state of movement.''“Enjoy it,” another blogger cautioned me, “because nothing will ever be this beautiful or wonderful ever again.”''It sounded so pessimistic. I didn’t want to believe it, but in a lot of ways, this became true for me and a battle that I would wage later, as you’ll see in year three.''The early days, so in love with traveling in Cambodia''Once I was on the road, I finally had something to pitch those bloggers who I had been networking with.''Since I didn’t have a lot of other things taking up my time like responding to comments, I did a lot of writing. I posted on my own blog three times per week and often guest wrote with a similar frequency.''This gave me exposure to new audiences but it also gave me valuable back links, which did and still do matter to Google in terms of rankings. Not everyone who I pitched said yes to me, and not every blog got me a bunch of new readers, but without putting in this work early on I’m not sure that I would be where I am now.\xa0I’d spend every third or fourth day working and spent the rest adventuring.''My main focus was backpacking on a shoestring around Southeast Asia, doing everything in''the cheapest way possible'', which led to some amazing adventures. I wrote my blog in a diary format, without much of an understanding of SEO. Monetization was not as common back then, so I didn’t spend my time pitching brands or chasing press trips – few PR firms had any idea about what a blogger was or how we could provide value.''In hindsight I believe this was my saving grace. The site was just about telling my story, and my aim was to use it as a resume to get other paid writing work.''Travel writing had always been my dream'', and in the early days, my goal was to just get freelance writing gigs and maybe a book deal. This did eventually happen, and''the book is a collection of excerpts from my diary and blog'', but that happened years later and I’m getting ahead of myself.''In Indonesia with everything I owned at the time.''In November 2012, a big curve ball came that I didn’t expect. I fell in love with someone in Laos and when he went back home to Australia, I was left conflicted. I had only just broken up with my previous boyfriend of four years in the name of freedom only to immediately fall for someone else. The timing was bad and so was my ability to say no.''Though things were rocky from day one, I made the decision to go to Australia and hang up my dream of traveling for a while. At the time, Australia’s dollar was actually stronger than the US dollar, and in Melbourne, salads are like 20 f-king dollars. Before I knew it I was spending the down payment for a house on avocado toast. I got a job at a high-end shoe shop, got back on the hamster wheel, and as''my relationship evaporated'', I asked myself why I wasn’t back in Southeast Asia.''So I forfeited my working holiday visa and went back to Thailand, desperately trying to hold the fragments that remained of my heart together. In time, I healed with the mountains and waters and volcanoes of Indonesia. I went home after 10 months of traveling and though everything seemed like a big question mark I knew one thing for sure:''I was not done yet''.''Kawah Ijen in Indonesia'', still one of my favorite memories''Year two: The 11th Hour''As I entered year two of blogging and traveling, I wasn’t getting much paid writing yet and I still wasn’t making any money off of my blog. To keep me afloat I sold that nice car from my banking days. With the money I got from that, I figured I could last another year abroad and since I had made the decision not to go back to my old life, keeping a car around seemed silly anyway.''After that, I flew to Europe and attended another TBEX conference, this time in Dublin, followed by the World Travel Market in London. My friend Dylan allowed me to stay in his flat in London for a month for free and after that, I went back to Southeast Asia. In the months that followed I moved slowly through the''Philippines''and''Vietnam''then made my way into China, a country I had fantasized about ever since living in Taiwan for 8 months when I was a student.''However China was not as cheap as Southeast Asia was, and as I started to see my cash dwindle again, I began to worry.''Would this blog ever take off? Would anyone ever want to hire me? Was there a point, really? Who was I kidding?''In order to save money, I began''hitchhiking around China'', which I will always remember with fondness for the incredible adventures it afforded me and for opening up my eyes to a whole new way of traveling. It was the impetus for a more adventurous side of me and a traveling method that I have now used on six out of seven continents.''However at this point, it was very much the 11th hour. I started to think about picking up a job teaching English or getting into marketing on the corporate level.''I don’t think I ever told you this, but through a connection of mine, I got to the interview phase for a marketing role at a fast food company in Australia. I nearly progressed with it and then I had to ask myself,''would I really feel good about running social media for something that is unhealthy for people?''I had spent years working at a job that I didn’t feel made anyone’s life better, and rather only made rich people richer. Did I really want to go back to that?''Around that time I applied for a job writing about festivals for about.com, a company that isn’t around anymore. I still remember the feeling of relief and lightness when I had a Skype interview while sitting in the remote mountain village of''Kangding''in Yunnan province, and was offered the job. I would write eight articles per month for $75 each, and the contract lasted for a year. It might not seem like much but that was the confidence boost I needed to turn the marketing opportunity down.''After securing that job and furiously writing enough articles for two months in two days, I disconnected to hike the''Annapurna Circuit in the Nepalese Himalayas''for two weeks. It was the first time that I hiked for more than one day at a time. In keeping with my habit of jumping into extreme things headfirst, I went from one day to two weeks in one shot, and fell in love with it.''I turned 28 on the day I reached the pass:''At the Thorung La pass in Nepal, the highest point of the circuit.''After that, I went to Berlin for the summer. An acquaintance of mine I’d met by chance''on a dive boat in the Philippines''was out of town and allowed me to stay at his apartment for less than half of the rent that he was paying. It has always been gifts from people like him that kept me going in those early years and I could not have done it without them.''Shortly after coming to Berlin, I was contacted by a study abroad company that needed articles to beef up their website.\xa0 He’d seen a guest blog I’d written on another site, thereby rewarding my past efforts.''It only paid $50 per article, but he told me that I could write as many as I wanted. So I wrote nine within three days and between that and the about.com contract, plus a very small amount of passive income that my blog was generating, I was able to earn between $1000 and $1500 per month.''My first summer in Berlin''That same summer, Matt, whom I had met at the first TBEX conference in Denver and kept in contact with, asked me if I wanted to write a column on his website about solo female travel. He liked my budget-oriented and adventurous travel style and saw a fit with his audience. His was the first travel blog I had ever read and was still a big fan of, so I enthusiastically said yes.''I vividly recall returning to California that summer and, beaming, telling my mom that I was making enough money from my site to keep going. I was so proud that 15,000 people visited it each month. I was going to make it.''Year Three: Taking Shape''At the start of my third year of blogging, an opportunity came my way from a blogger connection that I had made at a conference the year before, going in his place when he was invited on paid campaigns that he didn’t have time for. I was getting paid a fraction of the overall rate but I didn’t care. I was beyond excited to finally be getting paid to travel. That was the dream for me (still is).''Like this Christmas market campaign in Germany.''It was also nice that I was able to do all of this travel under his brand name instead of mine. I was not required to post about it on my channels, which was perfect because I could keep the branded content off of my blog. I also got my first sponsored post partnerships''like this one''and''this one'', and my monthly passive income steadily increased as well. By the fall of 2014, heading into the third year of my blogging career, I was making about $3000 per month on average.''I was staying in Berlin at the time in a room that cost me €300 per month, so I was able to survive quite comfortably on this.\xa0By that winter my blog readership had grown to about 30,000 unique visitors per month and after implementing a new strategy of only posting good DLSR photos instead of the oversaturated, HDR photos I’d been posting before (what was I thinking?) my''Instagram''started to grow more quickly too.''When 2015 arrived with a bang, I flew south like a goose to South Africa, chasing summer. I knew that it would cost more in South Africa than in Southeast Asia and Berlin, but I trusted that it would be alright. And it was! South Africa ended up being one of the''friendliest places''I had ever been to, and people were constantly inviting me to stay with them, so my''accommodation costs went down''considerably.''At Golden Gate National Park in South Africa''Africa changed something in me. I realized while I was there that I just wanted to be helpful, and started thinking about how to make my blog more of a resource than a diary, expanding it from just my story to a set of tips and itineraries. I found it hard to strike a balance — still do — but it seemed to work as my readership grew.''After returning back to Berlin that summer and finding a room for €275/month, I continued to freelance for the other blogger and go in his place on a couple more trips that summer, allowing me to get paid to travel some more, which took me to''Northern Ireland''.''Playing around in Northern Ireland at the Dark Hedges''I decided that this time, I would post about the campaign on my channels too, using the same hashtag. My posts ended up generating more engagement than the person whose place I had gone in. He was upset that we’d ‘overdelivered’ and in hindsight, I kind of understand. This led to the eventual demise of our working relationship.''However it led to bigger and better things, and it’s also where I met''Steve, a YouTuber''who involved me in some of his later projects. I’ll always be grateful to him for how helpful he was, once again demonstrating that success, at least for me, came from partnerships.''That summer I also started writing''Conquering Mountains: How to Solo Travel the World Fearlessly'', one of the most important things that I have ever done with my career. By that time, I had already been writing the solo female travel column on nomadicmatt.com for months and we knew that it was something his audience wanted more of.''I stayed up for days on end writing because I couldn’t think about anything else. I was obsessive. I turned nocturnal, and my stress levels got out of whack. This is my fault, not the book’s, but it consumed my entire summer as we went through five rounds of edits.''The end product was and still is something that I’m really proud of. When we released it the following fall, it was well received, much to my relief.''Year Four: My Big Break''This is when things really hit a turning point for me, and I can trace it all back to releasing that book. I was finally an expert on something, and I had the book to prove it.''Emboldened, I started pitching my story to various news outlets like''Business Insider'', and another opportunity came when''BuzzFeed''published an article about me, thanks to an introduction from Matt. Due to the success of that article, the''Daily Mail''reached out, and then''Inc.''published an article, too. Out of pure luck several of the stories went viral and were translated into several different languages, and practically overnight my blog readership grew to 70k unique viewers per month and my Instagram grew to about 20,000 followers. I was also offered a book deal,''which I accepted.''After the big release of the book I went on a trip to Iceland with my friend Maksim. Iceland would turn out to be one of the most important trips I ever took, resulting in some of my''most popular blog content''.''Simply amazed''That February, Steve and I went to Patagonia for two months, yet another place that would end up being incredibly important for my brand. I remember hitting 50,000 followers on Instagram and 85,000 unique monthly readers by the end of our trip.''At this point I decided to only focus on my own brand. I was making about $3000 per month passively and while not huge, it was enough to take another leap of faith. So I finished out all of my freelance contracts and chose not to renew, except for the''column with Nomadic Matt'', which I still happily write today.''The Southern Patagonian Ice Field. This is one of the best views I saw in Patagonia. So amazing''Everything was going well, at least on the surface. I really should have been happy, still on my pink cloud, but it was quite the opposite. What that other blogger had told me years before had come true.''This might seem incredibly ungrateful, but I just want to be honest – I was miserable again. I was miserable as soon as I started tasting success in year three. When I didn’t have a dime and I was hitchhiking, it felt more carefree, crazy as it sounds.''Yet with each passing year, I started to feel like I was way more ‘in’ the industry, and the back biting and shit talking started to involve me. Even though I genuinely tried to avoid it by refusing to engage in gossip, I still had a target on my back. What’s worse, I compared myself with others all the time. I also drank way too much, picked up a smoking habit for a while, and when I''looked in the mirror I only felt self-loathing.''I also felt like a brat – a self absorbed, ungrateful brat. I was sitting in Patagonia, about to hike for a week in the most gorgeous place on Earth,''having a nervous breakdown.''Things had to change.''The last networking conference I went to was World Travel Market in November 2015, and I haven’t been to any since. I more or less disassociated from the blogger community. I also eventually deleted Facebook from my phone and stopped looking at the newsfeed. I stopped looking at the blogger groups and paying attention to my competition.''It was a really good idea, you guys. The blogging world is worse than junior high.''Learning self care''That summer I got''two more''amazing jobs''through close friends of mine, and was finally offered my very own campaign in''Wisconsin'', all for me. Not through a connection, but just through them finding me online and liking my work. It felt amazing.''Within a matter of months, from a combination of book sales, growing affiliate income, and campaign payments, I wasn’t struggling anymore, and was making anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000 per month. Finally, I was in a financial position that would allow me to sign a lease and have my own apartment. Instead of scrambling to find a new room to stay in every time I came back to Berlin, I upgraded to an entire flat with an office.\xa0At 30 years old, I was a big girl living on her own for the first time, which you can''see a tour of here if you’re curious''.''Year Five: Figuring it Out Again''That summer I disconnected a bit more,''went down a more spiritual path'', and reconnected with someone who I had known in my university days but hadn’t talked to in about 10 years. We fell in love that fall after''Burning Man'', then after returning to a flat I’d just signed a lease for, I packed up and went back to California.''That relationship ultimately fell apart, but it sent me on a journey of exploration that was new to me. I started to question everything I knew and understood about the way that I fit into the fabric of the world. I poured myself into my work and also my own personal development, took another trip down to Africa, came back that summer and spent as much of it in the nature as I could.''By then I’d stopped smoking,''was exercising and being kinder to my body'', and I decided to stop drinking alcohol, too.''In a weird way, that breakup is one of the best things that ever happened to me. Writing this now, I am seeing a trend.''At the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania''At this point I decided to get into video – a huge increase in my work load but one that I love. I also finally hit 100,000 followers on Instagram, as well as breaking 120,000 unique readers per month on the blog. I started earning more each month and brought my assistant, Ashley, on full time, as well as''upgrading all of my camera''and computer equipment and adding a drone to the mix.''In July, I released my''first Facebook video''that I shot and edited completely on my own in''Kyrgyzstan'', and was almost instantly rewarded with over 160,000 views. I’m grateful for that early success and encouragement, and now I''add new YouTube videos weekly''as well. It’s humbling to be building something from scratch again, celebrating when my videos get just one comment or I get another new subscriber, but it’s something!''I also launched my biggest new product this fall after a tour guide named Pete reached out to me the winter prior, asking if I’d like to join him in''Alaska''to discuss the possibility of working together. The trip and his professionalism were fantastic, and we released the first''tour''in October, which sold out in 11 days.''Today: A New Beginning''For the first time this fall, I decided to''spend a full three months in Berlin''without getting on an airplane. In the past five years, there has been no time that I’ve done that.''It has helped me to reevaluate what I want to put out there and given me space to be creative. It has also helped me to see that I am a workaholic, and striking a balance is important.''Hey Berlin!''Today as I write this, I can’t help but feel overwhelmed with gratitude for this journey. Now the blog generates six figures per year, and welcomed 1.5 million readers in the past 12 months.''Pin me!''I hope that by writing this history down in its entirety, it helps to show that it was a labor of love that required a lot of faith and staying power in the beginning. Things came slowly, even if from the outside it appears that it all came very quickly. I owe so much to a few key people, and it wasn’t until the last two years that I was finally getting enough work on my own that I could fully sustain myself.''I want to also acknowledge that I’ve been given a lot of advantages in life. I did not grow up in a wealthy family by glitzy LA standards but when measured against the entire world, I had incredible privilege with access to a US passport, free education, and a family who supported and helped me. I know that there were also forces beyond my control that helped me here and there, many of which I’m unaware of and may never fully understand.''Sometimes I’m so happy that I could cry, and sometimes I worry that this castle could crumble overnight, and then what would I be left with?''Five years of incredible memories, the opportunity to have encouraged women to travel alone, the gift of sharing what I did and am doing and finding that you actually care, and connect with it. Though sometimes it can feel lonely traveling solo and working at home, this community is big, and beautiful, and kind, and supportive, and I love you all so damn much for being here.''Thank you, and I hope we always have a way of traveling this road together.''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Pin me!''It’s tough to think of a more beautiful corner of the world than the Philippines, with white sand beaches, bath-temperature water, and incredibly friendly locals.''These islands, 7,107 of them to be exact, are worth a departure from the typical banana pancake trail in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam! The beaches are regarded as some of the best in the world, as are''the diving opportunities'', and the welcoming nature of the Filipino people is unwavering.''But with so many islets to choose from offering up various culture, adventure and culinary delights, where do you even start to plan an itinerary and figure out where to go in the Philippines? Well luckily enough, Charlotte and I have spent roughly two months in the Philippines and have wrapped up our experiences into one neat little package below. Let’s get to planning your perfect Philippines itinerary:''Manila''It’s likely that you’ll begin your journey in the capital, Manila. A city bustling with people, Spanish colonial architecture, street vendors and Jeepneys.\xa0 Many travellers use Manila simply as a gateway to other destinations in the Philippines but we would recommend spending at least a day there in preparation for the rest of your adventure. It will also give you enough time to purchase your bus ticket to the North of Luzon, acclimatize, and sample street food like quack quack (battered quail egg) and caramelized bananas.''Quick Tip:''Take a Jeepney ride for as little as 10PHP to a random destination in town. Just get off where you feel spontaneous!''Stay:''Book your Manila stay here''.''North Luzon (Banaue / Batad Rice Terraces)''North Luzon is very much overlooked in the Philippines with travelers opting for pristine white beaches and crystal cobalt seas instead. However, we would highly recommend a trip into the mountainous region for a glimpse into the World of the local rice farmers and stunning craggy landscapes. The''UNESCO Banaue rice terraces''are a key highlight of any trip to the North.''Top Tip:''Most travelers visit Banaue due to the UNESCO title stamped across its name, however just an hour up the road (or up the mountain) lie Batad rice terraces which are just as beautiful and have far fewer tourists.''An overnight stay will allow you to live like the locals in a traditional stilt house built into the terrace. A trek to a neighboring waterfall is also on the agenda here and highly recommended! Wear a bathing suit and take a dip!''How To Get There:''Overnight buses such as''Ohayami''run from the Sampoloc area of Manila for $19, which can be purchased a day in advance or on the day of (subject to availability). They leave at 9pm.''Stay:''Batad Transient House''(traditional stilt house) for just $11 with a delicious breakfast!''Sagada''Home to the infamous hanging coffins, the Igoret tribes of the North have long practiced burying their dead in coffins nailed against the side of cliffs, believing they will be closer to heaven.''This tradition is slowly dying out, so this is a rare chance for a deeper glimpse into traditional tribal life. You can hop off at Sagada on a return bus trip to Baguio from Banaue.''Quick Tip:''Sagada has VERY limited ATMs and the one we did find had zero money, resulting in frantic phone calls home to wire money to Western Union Transfer! Take enough cash for your trip to Sagada.''Stay:''Book your Sagada stay here''.''Baguio City (Mount Pulag)''No trip to North Luzon is complete without visiting its highest peak at 2,926m above sea level. If that sounds like too much trekking for some then do not fear! Most of the journey is done by Jeepney to a mountain village where you stay overnight in a local house before taking on the summit in the early hours. In total the trek takes approximately 4-6 hours after reaching the village with a couple of rest breaks before reaching “the sky of clouds”.''Quick Tip:''Most tour operators will drop you back at Manila providing you advise that you want to be dropped off here INSTEAD of returning to Baguio. If you follow this itinerary chronologically, this is ideal as we’ll be flying down south next.''Go With:''Mount Pulag Adventures''Stay:''Book your Baguio City stay here''.''Boracay''A small island in central Philippines, Boracay is the top tourist draw of the Philippines, and for good reason! White beach takes center stage framing a 4km slice of paradise, once voted the best beach in the World (''check out our guide to the best beaches in the Philippines'')! An array of restaurants, resort accommodation and bars feature heavily along the main beach stations, while the back beach offers perfect conditions for water sports. Bar crawls, cliff jumping and ATV tours are all on offer here!''Quick Tip:''We recommend spending 3 or 4 nights in Boracay. Once you have partied your way through the island it will probably be time to move on anyway!''How To Get There:''Fly or ferry. We took the overnight ferry to save on accommodation and boarded from Batangas (reachable by 2 hour air conditioned bus from Manila). Ferries should be''booked a few days in advance with 2GO Travel''and they depart from 9pm and sail overnight to the port of Caticlan for $19 arriving at 7am dependent on sea conditions. From here passengers take a 10 minute boat across to the island.''Stay:''Hostel Avenue''is the only beach front hostel in Boracay opened 2017 for $17, located on White Beach.''Coron''Located in the province of Palawan, Coron is where you will find those''Insta perfect''dragon-esque landscape rock formations that penetrate the skies and inhabit turquoise lagoons below them. THIS is one of the reasons we first put the Philippines on our bucket list and trips to Barracuda Lake (fresh water lake), Kayagan Lake and the small and big lagoons are an absolute must on your visit here and can be booked one day in advance in the main town.''Coron is also dubbed as the shipwreck capital of the World''due to a large number of sunken Japanese vessels all within a 20-minute boat ride of the main town.''Quick Tip:''The town is quaint and buzzing with other travelers. In our experience, we preferred to avoid the crowds and booked a private charter with another couple to take us to the best snorkeling spots when the hundreds of orange lifejackets had already left. This also means you can hand pick your sightseeing spots and all for as little as a $25 increase on the popular tours!''How To Get There:''For approximately $90 we opted to fly from Caticlan (Boracay) to Coron and boy was it worth it! Boarding a small 12 seater''Air Juan''plane from Boracay you can swoop across the archipelago of the Philippines marveling at the tiny, Maldives like islets beneath you. A highly recommended way to see the Philippine landscape in all its glory!''Stay:''If you’re confident in speaking with the locals by now, a cheaper alternative to a''hostel on the main strip''is to walk the quieter streets of the town and find a friendly local who will offer up his spare room for free or for half the cost of a hostel. Still to this day staying in ‘Sheila’s’ room while she was away at University was one of our favourite stays of all our travels!''El Nido''Sticking with Palawan, El Nido is the next obvious destination to go to in the Philippines to get your jaw dropping landscape fix! The town is a traveler’s paradise, housing an array of budget accommodation, charming restaurants and bars and also ample diving opportunities. Take an''island hopping tour,''inclusive of small and big lagoons, 7 Commandos Beach, Snake Island and Cudugnon Cave. Tours start from around $26 inclusive of three or four destinations, oh and lunch is included too. Sold!''Quick Tip:''If your budget allows, we would highly recommend putting some money toward an''island hopping expedition from Coron to El Nido''. Sailing in and around some of the smallest and most remote islets of the Philippines was truly breathtaking. Sandbar slices of paradise, camping on secluded beaches and snorkeling in some of the clearest waters in the World were some of our favourite moments from the whole of our Philippines trip, not to mention singing Karaoke in a locals home with only the local villagers and rum to keep us company! For us, this was THE way to see the real Philippines at its most authentic.''Go With:''Buhay Isla run 3 and 4 night expeditions between Coron and El Nido ports.''Stay:''Book your El Nido stay here''.''Cebu''Our visit to Cebu was mainly focused around one sight in particular, Kawasan Falls. This picturesque waterfall that plummets into the turquoise lagoon below has quickly become an instagram favorite and when you see it, you’ll understand why! We would highly recommend getting there early to avoid the crowds.''The falls can be easily accessed from the main entrance. Take a tricycle from your guesthouse and they will already know where you want to go!''Quick Tip:''For the more adventurous traveler and for an alternative way in to the falls, opt for a canyoneering experience where you will be thrilled with 2-10m cliff jumps into the azure waters below. Taking a dip in such mesmerizing waters is highly recommended in any case, but to do it all with a rush as you jump and jolt from the limestone cliffs above is all the more exhilarating! Your experience ends at Kawasan Falls; the perfect end to such an adventure.''How To Get There:''Vans regularly leave from the town of El Nido to Puerto Princesa every hour directly to the airport. You can choose to either explore Puerto Princesa or fly directly to Cebu.''Go With:''We opted to canyoneer with''Highland Adventures''and found them to be reliable with all safety measures and equipment in place.''Stay:''Book your Cebu stay here''.''Oslob''It has always been a dream of ours to swim with whale sharks in a natural environment. We are so jealous of Kristin’s authentic experience with whale sharks in''Mozambique''and as avid divers we await the day until we get to see such a rare moment!''Although we were not 100% happy to swim with whale sharks while they are being fed, we did in fact get to swim with them in Oslob as part of a tour we were doing. They are some of the most beautiful creatures we have ever laid eyes upon as they graciously swoon in the waters collecting fish that are being served for them. We caved into the experience here as we justified the experienced based on the sharks being allowed to come and go as they please, but we await an authentic experience with much more excitement!''Be My Travel Muse generally does not support animal encounters like this that alter the animal’s natural behavior, but it felt remiss to leave this off of the itinerary since many people do want to have this experience. It is here to provide information rather than encourage you to participate, however. More ethical alternatives where the sharks are not being fed include the Bay of Los Angeles in California,''the Maldives'',''Mozambique'', and many others depending on the season.''Bantayan Island''An off the beaten path island that is often overlooked by many taking the main tourist trail but conveniently located north east of Cebu. Still a hidden gem, locals will welcome you into their guesthouses with open arms for you to explore powdery, undeveloped white sand beaches, local cafes, fish markets and of course skydiving! Yes, you read that correctly, Bantayan island is home to the only place to''skydive in the Philippines''and of course we had to try it!''Quick Tip:''Although we were there largely to skydive, Bantayan ended up one of our favorite destinations in the Philippines due to the untouched landscape, local food, secluded sands, and of course the friendly Filipino people. Take a bike ride between Santa Fe and the neighboring village and stop off at the local cafes (which are essentially villages houses) and take in the local life sipping on cheap, cold beer. You can thank us later!''How To Get There:''Take a taxi to Cebu North bus terminal. Board a bus to Hagnaya (3 and a half hour from Cebu City for $3.62). At the Hagnaya terminal boats to Bantayan island leave every hour up until 4pm and cost $3.85.''Stay:''Book your Batayan Island stay here''.''Visa Requirements''Always check your visa requirements before entering the country but for most, you can enter the Philippines without a visa for up to 30 days, providing you have evidence of onward travel.''Extending your visa is a simple enough procedure however. You can apply to do so at the Bureau of immigration to allow 59 days. We would recommend not doing this in Manila and opt to extend on one of the smaller islands such as Boracay as the procedure is much more simple and a lot quicker.''Getting around:''Luckily, travel in and around the Philippines is relatively inexpensive, though may require some forward planning.''Buses: Many destinations within provinces can be reached by bus, especially in the North and at short notice too should there be availability. All are air conditioned, cheap and some even provide a snack! We recommend an overnight bus as the perfect way to save on accommodation while getting from A to B. What’s not to love!''Jeepneys: Do take a Jeepney when possible! Not only is a good way to sample local transport in a pimped out American armored vehicle but it is also cheap too.''Boats / Ferries: Given the Philippines has some 7,000+ islands, this should be no surprise. Many online agents provide bookings in advance (1 or two days is sufficient) and overnight ferries in particular are comfortable and air conditioned depending on class. You can also buy tickets directly at the port to save on fees, but during holidays expect to have to wait a few days to be able to book!''Flights: Flying between provinces isn’t actually as expensive as it first sounds, should you fly at the right times and between the right destinations. It also allows you to see the archipelago from above too! We think that’s worth the money all by itself.''Taxis: Many city provinces such as Manila and Cebu have taxis, however the cheaper alternative is a tricycle (motorbike with side cart). Tricycles are a great way to zip around and are also considerably cheaper than taxis. Always ask to journey on the meter and it is always worth researching how much they should charge per km to avoid overpricing.''So have you fallen in love with the Philippines yet? These secluded white slices of sand, the clearest waters in the world, the culinary local delights, and the spirit of the Filipino people all make this country one of our favorites in the world. All this, coupled with the relative''cheapness''to many other similarly beachy destinations and ghe ease of getting around makes it an absolute must visit!''We hope this helped you put together an itinerary and figure out where to go in the Philippines, but please feel free to ask any questions you have in the comments below.''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Welcome to another fabulous solo female travel story! With this column it is my aim to show that solo female travelers come from all corners of the earth and from all kinds of backgrounds, so you’re not just hearing from the same white American girl all the time!''Today I want to share the story of See, a solo traveler from Malaysia who, like me, is quite fond of hitchhiking!''Before I started hitchhiking, I believed that it was an unsafe and scary way to get around. But when I finally tried it in China I found that it was exhilarating and it gave me an amazing peek into the culture, plus it taught me so much about human generosity. But no matter how many times I share that opinion, it’s just one girl’s thoughts, so today I’ve invited See to tell us her experience too.''Here’s See in her words:''Tell us about yourself!''See, an adventurous hitchhiker from Malaysia''My name is See Yin. Most friends refer me as See, except for my grandmother because in her Chinese dialect it would mean''death'', literally! I am born and bred in''Malaysia'', a Southeast Asian country blessed with''multi-ethnic, multicultural''and''multilingual influences''. For that, I am a polyglot with the ability to speak five languages: English, Chinese Mandarin, Malay (Malaysia’s official language), and two other Chinese dialects commonly used in different parts of China.''Language has always been an amazing toolkit''to carry around when I travel solo, and sometimes, reminds me of who I am.''Contrary to most people who quit their corporate jobs to backpack the world, I was fortunate enough to have started my little-big solo backpacking journey before I enrolled myself in the life of working adulthood. After moving abroad to Turkey for a student exchange program, I hitchhiked and couchsurfed my way through 7 countries in the span of 7 months.''With a bunch of other Couch-surfers at Sibiu, Romania''What motivated you to travel alone for the first time?''I can never tell my travel story without mentioning my love at first sight with a mosque-like church (or church-like mosque) I stumbled upon in one of the architectural books I’d read years ago. It was Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, an orthodox church turned mosque during the Ottomans’ occupation and now a museum. It’s a rare monument with two worldly influences co-existing with each other harmoniously. I signed up immediately when I knew that Turkey was in one of my college’s student exchange programs, and went crazy with several part time jobs at that time knowing that my parents wouldn’t be able to afford my expenses. Albeit having had''mixed reactions from friends and family''on my decision to study in Turkey, especially the concerns of my personal safety, I knew it was THE chance that I will have to jump onto no matter what it takes – I remember my young heart pounding so hard, so hard that it actually hurt, but''so eager to see the world''at the same time.''I was 19 then. I witnessed Hagia Sophia with my own eyes, shook, awestrucked, emotional, and I fell in love once again with the many possibilities that I could interact with the world. Finishing my studies in Istanbul, I booked a one-way flight to UK. Started with bunking at a few friends’, I then tried Couchsurfing as a way to travel cheap. Couchsurfing turned out to be the most amazing support system I had when I travel to new cities and countries alone – some hosts went all the way to tour me around, prepared local dishes, made sure I felt like home, and we exchanged stories of our worlds. For this reason, I was motivated to travel to see more, and to meet more interesting people as I collect their narratives of the world. I ended up couchsurfing from UK all the way back to Turkey, bunking at more than 10 couches in different parts of Hungary, Austria, Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece in the span of more than half of a year.''With her Couchsurfing host in Salasu de sus, Romania''What are your favorite Couchsurfing and hitchhiking memories?''One of the many favorite encounters on the road was with a Canadian traveler who’d been on the road for years at that time, she taught me hitchhiking. “The tip to hitchhike for a female solo traveler, is to be fearlessly confident – people can feel it when you are fearless and brave”, she said; I followed her tip and had managed to save all my transportation costs by hitchhiking,''crossing borders in huge trucks'', fancy sports car, and a chocolate candy van (was showered with free chocolates!).''Another favorite was my couchsurfing experience in the western Romania, a mountainous village in Salasu de Sus, where my couchsurfing host had built the house himself right next to a river. There were no running water, electricity, and toilet in the house. The toilet as big as a phone-booth was built outside the house in the woods, in a makeshift fashion with four wooden walls around it and a hole dugged a few feet deep to the ground as the ‘toilet bowl’. Using the toilet was an amusing, odd, and not the most pleasant experience for me, and I remember having constipation for the few days staying at this beautiful house (other than the toilet!) in the countryside! Also, brushing my teeth at the river in the freezing winter days was another experience!''Which misconceptions did you have about hitchhiking as a solo female traveler that you now realize were untrue?''Growing up in a typical Asian family, I was taught to never trust strangers. Sleeping in someone else’s couch? That’s insane. Jumping in a stranger’s car? A big no. Of course I was skeptical with what the Canadian traveler told me about hitchhiking, and was actually scared the first few times trying to hitch a ride in the foreign lands. I had a traveler’s knife with me for emergencies (while hitchhiking) but fortunately, never had the chance to use it! The drivers who stopped for me were all amazing humans, who were''purely happy about giving the girl a ride''and some even bought me lunches at the stopovers. I think traveling solo is hard if there were no trust with strangers. My hitchhiking and couchsurfing experiences were all so beautiful because of''this little leap of faith''that I learned to invest in every stranger that I met along the way.''Hiking Santorini, Greece''What are some of your advice to solo female travelers out there who want to give hitchhiking a try?''I won’t say that jumping into a stranger’s car is completely safe and I would think that my experience is subjective to my own plus a little bit of good luck – after all, there were also unfortunate episodes of hitchhiking stories that you should take into account before trying it out. I would give you the advice that was given to me by the Canadian traveler (her name is Alissa by the way!): be fearless, you know how the predators can sense the fear of their preys and they feed on those fears? Secondly, take the most used routes with a lot of traffic, avoid shortcuts and all the off-the-beaten routes! Next, bring a map with you and know where you are going – I relied a lot on my phone’s GPS to know where I was going and that I was on the right path. There are a lot of tips that you can refer to on hitchwiki.org (yes, there’s a wikipedia on hitchhiking!).''What are some unexpected benefits of traveling alone?''Get the Guidebook for Solo Female Travelers!''I realize that the more I travel, the less I know. I never knew traveling could teach me so much about being humble, and I have never felt so small!''Among many other lessons'', traveling alone taught me a lot about tenacity. There were episodes and moments of hesitation, fears, and''loneliness being alone on the road'', but they were also the sources that fueled me through the journey.

This list is by no means exhaustive, but it’s a great place to start:''Luang Prabang, Laos''These waterfalls, though!''This beloved city in Laos’ north is picturesque and full of things to do. The French colonial architecture, the waterfalls outside the city, the sunset cruises on the mighty Mekong River, the bowling alley that somehow stays open far after Laos’ curfew, and the night market all combine to make this one of the best spots in Laos and all of Southeast Asia for solo travelers.''Though''the whole of Laos''is fantastic, Luang Prabang in particular impressed me with its beauty and wealth of activities.''Pai, Thailand''Beautiful Pai''One thing that makes me''love Pai so much''is how many interesting, spiritual, and fun-loving people I meet there.

The best part was that at night, I could swim in the water, confident that there was nothing scary in it, and watch as blue bioluminescence followed my fingers and hair. It was magical.''Otres is much less rowdy than its neighbor, Serendipity Beach. It also tends to cater to far fewer travelers, so the chances of seeing familiar faces day after day is higher there. You can get there by taking a bus to Sihanoukville and then a tuk tuk to Otres.''Gili Air or Gili Trawangan''A lovely Gili Air sunset''I’ve logged some time on both islands, a speed boat away from Bali. Gili Trawangan (‘T’ for short), has become more and more of a party island over the last few years, while Gili Air has awoken from its quiet slumber and risen to the occasion as well, but to a much lesser degree.''Both islands are gorgeous, known for their fantastic diving and snorkeling spots, are affordable, and have a laid back vibe that I love.

So things like jeans don’t make a lot of sense. It is also more on the modest side, so bringing lightweight clothing that covers your shoulders and upper legs is also a good idea, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia.''I tend to like leaving some room in my backpack for purchases in Southeast Asia.

It is as simple as picking a hostel on''Hostelworld''that you like the description of, and sitting in the common room. You almost have to work hard''not''to meet other people.''Even if hostels aren’t your thing, I have also met other people on buses, boats, in restaurants, bars, and''on diving trips''. I generally find that travelers are friendly people and since Southeast Asia has a well-trodden backpacker trail, you can pretty much count on meeting others,''even if you’re the shy type''.''How to Stay Safe''Hanging out at Elephant Falls in DaLat Vietnam''Another reason why I love Southeast Asia for solo female travelers is the safety. Though some of the countries do have a bit of political unrest from time to time, it hardly ever affects tourist safety. For example, I was in Thailand a few years ago during the coup d’état and other than a curfew, it was not all-out mayhem like I would have pictured a coup to be.''Your biggest concerns will be bag snatching thieves. They run rampant in the big cities in Vietnam and Cambodia. Usually they target people who have straps that look easy to cut. I have''a listing here''of bags that are harder to slash and go across the body. It’s also advisable to keep your phone and other valuables hidden until you are in a place where you can safely check them. You can also turn your back towards the buildings and face the street if you absolutely must check your phone, as it makes it harder for thieves on motorbikes, which is their usual method, to drive up behind you snatch your phone without you seeing them coming.''The other thing is poisoned alcohol. It doesn’t happen often, but when it does''it’s usually all over the news''. To avoid this, I would suggest buying beer which is opened right in front of you and is much harder to tamper with. Alcohol also presents a big problem if you drink too much of it, regardless of whether you are at home or abroad. Take it easy, and if you know that you have a problem with limiting your consumption, consider abstaining.''How to Make the Most of it''Hanging out in Pai''Once you arrive in Southeast Asia, it will be easy to see why so many people love going there and spend years traveling around the region. If you can stand it, try to leave your trip as open ended and unplanned as possible.

Going carry-on means never having to pay for a checked bag, or losing it to the airline lottery, it also means being able to walk around with your stuff on without suffering under a heavy load, and it’s much easier to keep track of everything when there’s less to keep track of!''Contrary to what I used to believe, traveling carry-on only does not mean that you have to sacrifice fashion nor does it mean giving up basic necessities. For over half of the time that I’ve been traveling the world, I’ve been able to do it with only a carry-on bag, including in the winter!''It just comes down to getting creative and having the right items to make it easier to go the minimalist route.''This video details how I fit everything into my bag, followed by additional resources and tips to help you manage to travel carry-on only. Are you ready to save your back? Let’s do this!''*I think this is what they call a ‘face for the radio’*''Cut What You Want to Take in Half''This is the hard part – evaluating if what you want to bring is really, honestly necessary. Do you really need a hair straightener (honestly no, embrace your natural hair)? Or that much makeup (same thing)? A few select items you’re likely to use just once, or maybe never?''If anything in your pile is ‘just in case’ then try to eliminate it. That goes double for products. In general all you need on a daily basis is shampoo, deodorant, soap, conditioner, and moisturizer, right? You can buy new toiletries on the road. Pantene seems to be ubiquitous, as does Dove. The things that aren’t as easy to replace are that special moisturizer that you can only get at home, and Venus razors, so bring that with you. Otherwise, refill on the road!''It’s also important to get clear on what prescriptions you can refill on the road and what you should take along with you. This is up to each individual case and isn’t something I can answer for you here, but don’t skimp on must-haves like contacts and prescriptions.''It really comes down to clothing choices, which I have a few tricks for:''Our Secret Weapon: The Packing Cube''This is packing hack for making the carry-on life work. It has two sides – one for dirty clothes and one for clean. I have been using the same packing cube and stuffing it to the brim for the last five years and it barely shows any wear and tear. Though there are plenty of brands out there, I can only wholeheartedly recommend''this one from Eagle Creek''(affiliate link).''The Backpack''REI no longer makes the backpack that I bought five years ago, but their bags are all high-quality. I know because I have abused this one for years on end, so if you have an REI anywhere near you, pop in and try a few on with weight.''Though''I recommend this Osprey bag''on my gear lists because it’s the best alternative, I would much rather that you go and try on a backpack in person than buying through my affiliate link. It’s so important to make sure that it fits your body and that it also feels good when it’s heavy. This thing is going to be your turtle shell, so it’s got to be comfortable!''It should fit around your waist comfortably enough that you almost don’t even need to use the shoulder straps. The weight should be distributed evenly on your entire body, and the straps should all be suited to your height and measurements. This is why trying on in person is so important. You may also find that a bag you like without weight feels much different with weight. In general, I think the ones that rest right on your back distribute the weight better, rather than the ‘breathable’ ones with a layer that pushes the bag off of your back (''like this'', which I would not recommend but am including for reference).''If You’re Worried About Having Clothing Options''Fear not!''Don’t worry about fashion choices. Almost everywhere in the world that I go, I end up wanting to buy clothing while I’m there. It’s generally much better suited to the environment and it’s my favorite kind of souvenir. This isn’t going to be true if you’re going somewhere that is super expensive compared to your home country, but in many cases like in most of Asia, there are really cool local finds to buy. I also periodically exchange clothes with other backpackers I meet on the road so that we can keep our wardrobes fresh. Chances are you’ll meet people who, if you suggest doing a swap, will be happy to because they’ll be equally tired of what they have!''Or you can always donate what you have and then buy new stuff. You’re going to save so much money on checked bag fees that buying a new shirt here or there is not going to matter.''A Word About Hiking Boots''Shoes take up a lot of space, and my biggest question came down to whether or not running shoes would work for hiking. In places with rocky trails like''Alaska''or''Patagonia'', I do think it’s potentially dangerous to wear running shoes. It would also not have been possible for me to go carry-on only there because I needed my bigger pack for hiking the 8-day trails.''However in Southeast Asia, and even on the''Annapurna circuit'', I did my hikes in running shoes and it worked for me, plus allowed me to travel without heavy hiking boots. My daily shoes are flip-flops and they usually do the job just fine!''What About Jackets?''On airplanes and on mountaintops, a jacket is pretty useful. However it can also take up a lot of space. In the case that I really needed something warm, I was usually able to rent it or borrow in Southeast Asia. Otherwise I suggest something small that folds up easily or that you can just clip to the outside of your backpack. A lightweight rain jacket or fleece is perfect.''How to Check in Seamlessly''What about going over the weight for your flights? If you have the possibility of doing an online check-in and getting an electronic boarding pass, it’s possible that no one will ever ask to weigh your bag before you board the flight. Of course, it’s important to make sure that you can lift it up and put it in the overhead compartment on your own and that you keep a reasonable amount of weight in it.''That said, if it is overweight, wear it on your back when you check in so that it doesn’t arouse as much suspicion and if you do have to check it, take out the valuables and make peace with it. That said, I’ve only had my bag weighed thrice out of five years of traveling.''If you want some help on what to pack for wherever it is you plan on going, check out''the packing list for everywhere in the world.''Whenever possible, I opt to go carry on for the ease of it. I haven’t always been able to make it happen depending on the gear load, but when I have, I’m always so much happier to have less to carry.''I can leave the airport when I land without waiting for the baggage carousel to start its dance, I can rest assured that I’ll never arrive anywhere without my stuff, and I know that it’s always with me, safe from thieves.''Pin me!''The smaller the bag, the easier it’ll be, trust me!''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''I still remember the way it felt walking off the plane, leaving my trepidation in the seat, wading into the cacophony of sounds in the arrivals hall of Bangkok airport, weaving through the glass doors, and out into the soft morning sunlight.''The air had an entirely different quality in Southeast Asia, comforting with its heavy sweetness, a rush of warmth like a sauna reaching out and enveloping my body, drawing me in.''This was over five years ago, on September 27, 2012, when I flew to Bangkok\xa0Suvarnabhumi Airport with a''one way ticket''to begin the journey that I’m still on today. I didn’t know back then that leaving a steady job,''selling off almost everything'', leaving a relationship and effectively demolishing bridges behind me would work out.

As''winter approaches in Berlin'', why not go back to where it all started, in the land of smiles?''But what will it be like this time? I’m not in my 20s anymore. I’m not as gung-ho about sharing a room with 5 drunk backpackers anymore (me previously being one of them – no judgement).''But I don’t party like that anymore.

Can I balance my desires with my wallet?''I shan’t be wearing this backpacker uniform this time around.''Most of all I wonder, will everything be different? Will it in many ways still be the same? Can I really hold Thailand to high expectations of remaining unchanged when I’ve changed so much myself?''I think the only reasonable thing to do here is to go into it without expectations, and to just let it be what it will be, just like meeting up with an ex you haven’t seen in years but never really let go of.

Therefore, I got to work.''My first YouTube video of Slab City took me a full two days to edit, just learning the ropes and trying to figure out how to make it all work, but I was rewarded quickly when it started to get several thousand views:''It felt pretty good, (I think?) when a friend asked who I got to edit the Kyrgyzstan video embedded above, knowing that I was brand new to the game.''Each video is a learning experience and I’m getting faster and (I hope, you tell me!) better with each one that I do.''How to Get Views''The modules were also helpful with how to get the videos noticed.

I find that most people are either a big YouTuber, or a big blogger, but not both. However video is a great complement to writing and photography.

What began as one of the busiest airports in Europe soon became a lifeline to West Berlin during the years that the city was divided, and t''hese days it truly embodies the spirit of Berlin – repurposing something old into something quirky and cool.''“Berlin is a pioneer in re-using buildings that were left over after the division of the city,”''Tempelhof Projekt chief Gerhard W. Steindorf says.''I totally agree.''When the weather is fine, Tempelhof is a 300-hectare public space perfect for summer BBQs, kite surfing, and taking a stroll through the past.''The grounds are free to enjoy though the airport itself is also worth checking out, which can only be done on a''guided tour''these days.''It’s a treat for lovers of history. It feels stuck in time.''The Beginning''In the early 1920s, Tempelhofer Feld was a parade ground for troops on weekdays, and a leisure park on the weekends. The gigantic site was also used to test some of the first aircrafts in the world, and in the 1930s, it''welcomed more passengers than any other airport in Europe''.''When the Nazis came into power in 1933, it did not take long for them to take over the airport and turn it into a concentration camp that housed journalists, politicians, prominent Jews, communists, lawmakers, homosexuals and any other “undesirables”.''Hitler commissioned architect Ernst Sagebiel to design the airport in monumental Nazi style. The airport was never completed, but today, you can still see traces of what was installed at the site, including a reinforced concrete skeleton, and red scorch marks from the fire that took place at the end of the war on top of the window frames. Because of its enormous size, it was cited as the “''mother of all modern airports.”''Inside the arrivals hall''It’s also where Lufthansa was founded.''The Berlin Air Lift''The Tempelhof airport played a significant role in Berlin’s separation. During WWII, when bombs fell on Berlin,''people fled to the air-raid shelters in the airport''. The airport was also converted into a combat aircraft and weapon making factory.''Shortly after the war, Germany’s defeat led to a division of Soviet, American, British, and French zones of occupation. This eventually segued into a Western and an Eastern, Soviet-occupied, sector, thereby contributing to the Cold War division of Europe. At that time, much of Berlin was''nothing but rubble''– more than 600,000 apartments were destroyed, and only half of the city’s original population remained.''Failing to come to an agreement on the country’s reunification, the Soviets blocked all road access between West Germany and West Berlin, essentially''cutting off the occupation zone''from the American, British, and French. The United States supplied West Berlin entirely by air over the next year, landing planes at Tempelhof filled with necessities for the people, until the Soviets lifted the blockade and allowed supply overland once again.''While normal contact resumed, the zone was still cut off from its Western counterpart, and basically reduced to a Soviet satellite. Thousands of East Germans began''fleeing to West Germany''to look for better opportunities on a daily basis. At that point, Tempelhofer Airport was the main departure point for the East Germans, until the infamous Berlin Wall was built overnight on 13 August, 1961, and officially separated Western and Eastern Berlin.''Today''What was once Germany’s busiest airport is now one of the largest public spaces in Europe. The airport was closed to air traffic in 2008 and today, visitors fascinated by the airport’s history fill the park, which is now named Tempelhofer Freiheit, or Tempelhofer Freedom, though everyone just calls it Tempelhofer Feld.''For the most part, it’s a hangout now where locals have summer BBQs, and people fly kites, or wind surf on the old tarmac. It’s pretty cool, actually, to be walking through a city, to happen upon an old airport, and to see someone with a kite cruising down the asphalt just like planes did back in the day.''It’s also still possible to go inside the old airport, which appears stuck in time. You can sit on the conveyer belts, step behind the check-in counters, walk down the old staircases and into the various rooms of the airport, all of which is still decorated in the old style.

Today, I am introducing you to Sibéal, an Irish travel photographer and arctic adventurer living in Iceland.''She inspires me with her truly adventurous spirit and dedication to places in this world that aren’t just sunny and comfortable, but rather rugged, cold and inhospitable, yet also beautiful in their wildness.''The arctic is a part of the world I’ve fallen more and more in love with as well, realizing that while tropical beaches are fantastic, there might be something even more special about the far north.''This is Sibéal’s story:''Sibéal at Jökulsárlón glacial lagoon, Iceland''Tell us about yourself!''My name is Sibéal and I suppose one word my friends would use to describe me is adventurous. I am that person who wants to try everything!''I seem to be particularly drawn to cold countries, and I love the Arctic. I’ve spent some time sailing in Greenland,''Canada''and''Alaska''; and I’m the''first Irish woman to sail through the Northwest Passage''along with my aunt. So it was not that strange that I ended up moving to''Iceland''last year after coming on a hiking trip for a few months!''What motivated you to travel alone for the first time?''When I was 21 my mother asked me if I wanted a birthday party or to go to''China''. It was a pretty obvious choice for me! My grandfather always said “He who travels fastest travels alone”. It’s not even so much the speed of travelling for me but''the freedom to do what I want when I want to''. I learned pretty early in life that if you’re waiting for someone else to be ready to take a trip, you’re always going to be waiting. And life is too short to do that.''Sometimes I do travel with friends or family – the Arctic ocean is not usually a place to go solo – but about 85-90% of my travels have been alone. I am really picky about my travel partners too! I think you should be reasonably compatible – there’s no point in someone who loves beach holidays teaming up with someone who loves''off the grid mucky hiking trips'', unless you’re both really open to something new, or you’ll all have a miserable time and that’s no fun for anyone.''Taking photos of an Arctic hare (the gun is for protection against polar bears), Nunavut, Canada''Which misconceptions did you have about solo travel that you now realize were untrue?''That it’s lonely. I’m pretty self-sufficient so I do like having my own space but''you can definitely make friends, even if you’re naturally shy'', which I am. But if I want to talk to someone I have to make that bit of effort that I would have found much harder in the past – it gets easier for sure! And I’ve''made lifelong friends travelling''too. For example one night in Poland I was sharing a train carriage with a young couple who offered me a beer, got chatting and they asked me where I was staying. When I said I hadn’t booked anything but I would surely find something near the train station they insisted on taking me to their friend’s flat where they were staying, their friend’s flatmate being Kasia who I’ve stayed in touch with since, visited, and who even showed my family around Krakow when they visited the city!''One piece of advice I have for fellow travellers is don’t automatically assume the locals are out to get you, or that all fellow travellers are saints.

There are a lot of good people in the world.''Riding her favourite Icelandic horse bareback at Núpshestar, Iceland''What are some unexpected benefits of traveling alone?''You have the freedom of choosing what you want to do, when you want to do it. Maybe that''sounds like I can’t compromise''(?) – I can by the way! But it’s more about getting up in the morning and not having to wait around for someone else, not having to plan too much, or spend ages deciding what to do. There are definitely things I’ve done that I wouldn’t have in a group.''You also learn so much more about yourself''. You have to solve any problems that come up, which makes you much more self-reliant. You learn independence and being able to take care of yourself, push yourself outside of your comfort zone. You do need to be switched on in terms of safety but I don’t think any more than I would be at home either.''I think people are more likely to approach someone on their own, and go out of their way to help them. I’ve been given the use of an apartment in Hungary, had people bring me to where I wanted to go in Morocco, been invited to family dinners in Norway – that’s kinda hard to do if you’re in a group.''The minus, of course, is not sharing fuel costs or accommodation, but that’s a little thing.''On Ireland’s highest mountain – Carrauntoohil, Co Kerry, Ireland''Where have you been that you think is perfect for solo female travelers?''Honestly I don’t think there’s anywhere I’ve been so far that isn’t suitable for solo female travellers, but Iceland, where I’m currently living, is particularly good for someone who is maybe a little nervous of travelling on their own. Nature is the most dangerous thing here – the weather is harsh, but for personal safety it’s probably the safest country in the world.''I’ve''hiked, camped and hitchhiked all over the country''and never felt unsafe. But do be prepared for bad weather, and take weather warnings seriously. You do have to make a bit of effort to get to know the locals – they aren’t in your face friendly like in other countries, which actually suits me; but there are plenty of solo travellers too. And you can always join a day tour to meet more fellow travellers or go to one of the meetup groups. It’s''a stunning country with lots to do''for anyone who likes the outdoors.''In Jardin Majorelle, Marrakech, Morocco''What are some obstacles you’ve had to overcome in order to make traveling a lifestyle?''I suppose you have to prioritise what’s important to you financially.

Though I suppose if I planned well neither of those need be huge stumbling blocks either. Sometimes''I do miss my family and friends''. Though a lot of my friends are scattered around the world too. Really no one is further away than my phone when you think about it. Modern technology does help, there have been times when I only got to call home once a month, and that involved climbing a mountain sometimes to get a signal!''At the Sólheimajökull glacier, Iceland''How did Be My Travel Muse help you?''I think it’s great to see a resource to''encourage people to travel'', whether it’s solo or not. And reading about how other people can do it will definitely encourage someone who wants to but is a little unsure if they can. I’ve met people recently in Iceland who had to get a passport just for that trip, and I think it’s great that they are finally doing it – travel is really the best education.

Thankfully I quickly learned how to streamline the process.''Back on my first solo trip to Southeast Asia in 2012, all that I had along with me was my DSLR and to my laptop.

My computer has its own little area to hang out, each lens has its own well-padded compartment, and there are spaces for SD cards and my batteries as well. Everything has its place and it makes it much easier to organize that way.''This bag also has an RF ID blocker so that if someone tries to scan my passport info, they are out of luck.

If I am going somewhere where I will be filming above and below water, like for my upcoming trip to Mexico for example, then the size of my bag needs to expand to accommodate the dome and the drone.''In that case I actually bring more tech gear than I have clothing and shoes! For this I like to use a 40L backpack. I particularly appreciate that this one has a back panel that opens up. It’s more secure because nobody can unzip my backpack to steal my computer, and it is also way easier at airport security not to have to dig through to get to the bottom and find my computer like I did with my old REI backpack.''This bag also has clipping and locking zippers and a waist strap to help distribute the weight.''For their functionality, locking zippers, the difficulty involved in stealing from me, and the little camera compartments that they come with, those are my favorite bags of the moment for my trips.''I’m sure as my electronics continue to grow (I have to stop at some point, right?!), so will the sizes of my bags, but for now, these are the ones that I love and use the most.''READ NEXT: The Best Anti-Theft Purses for Travel''*This post is brought to you in partnership with Pacsafe, a company I have trusted and loved for the past five years.

This is true for almost all of the hikes in Saxon Switzerland.''And a few ladders as well.''There are a few different starting points that you’ll see indicated by parked cars along the Elbeitenweg to get to the lookout point (''map here''). Some add just a bit more time than others, but in general you’ll need about 45 minutes each way, and be sure to leave yourself ample time at the top!''Bastei Bridge''Lovely at golden hour''The Bastei bridge was constructed in 1851 as a tourist attraction and still serves its purpose with dazzling efficiency to this day. It’s easily the most visited site in the park and is also the easiest to get to – coincidence? It never is with such things.''I do so love that arms up in photos thing''There are several viewpoints around the bridge in addition to the bridge itself, all of which are free to visit with the exception of one part of the bridge that has a 2€ entry fee.

It’s across from the Königstein Fortress so if you climb up to one, you can see the other across the way.''This hike also took a leisurely 30 minutes each way, almost entirely up and back down stairs, pausing at the top for a fantastic view of the Elbe River and beyond.''Malerweg''If you have a week to spare, hike the long-distance''Malerweg\xa0(Painters’ Way) trail''.

There isn’t much around it at all, so it’s a destination in itself, or best visited on your way to somewhere else.''The easiest and fastest way to get to this bridge is to drive there.

And it’s okay too.''I often come across as brave on this blog because I’ve''hitchhiked''solo and''traveled solo in Africa,''which some people think is scary, but I am honestly not the poster child for bravery. I was scared shitless of traveling by myself.''On my very first day in Bangkok, after getting scammed by a tuk tuk driver.''Sometimes I still get scared before going somewhere''I know nothing about'', but I know now''from experience''that in the end that it’s going to be okay.''I do find it motivating to get out of my comfort zone these days, because I’ve done it so many times and now I think it’s exhilarating.

Here are a few ways to combat the fears:''Give Your Fears Names''The more I have practiced mindfulness meditation the more I have learned to observe my thoughts as just what they are – things coming into my mind, usually with the intention of helping me even though they do the opposite. But they are just thoughts and they are not''me''. They do not have to define me.''Sometimes it helps to just say to them, “oh hey, pain!”, “oh hey, fear!” Kind of like acknowledging a little barking dog or a cricket that makes a whole lot of noise for its tiny body.''Fears are just fears – take the plunge''Observing and conceptualizing these fears as little beings that are not you when they come up might help you to stop them from taking over your thoughts entirely.''Have a plan in place''What is it exactly that you’re scared of? Is it money? Is it safety? Is it the fear of loneliness?''I find that having a clear answer to each of these potential problems is really helpful. Am I worried about running out of money? Then I will have a financial plan in place. Am I worried about safety? Then I will learn about the precautions I need to take (''this list from 31 solo female travelers''is a good place to start!).''You can also''check out my book''for a boat load more detail on each of these things.''Going solo can be amazing''Know that most personal safety problems stem from being alone at night or getting too intoxicated – these are things you can avoid!''Unfortunately, there are jerks out there who prey on people who are by themselves at night, or too drunk to defend themselves.''They know no sex or gender.

You already know that you won’t be alone too much because you will meet plenty of other people, you don’t have to worry about planning everything out yourself, and you still get to have a really amazing travel adventure without all of the responsibilities falling to you.''It’s the call that I made when I traveled through Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia on a tour instead of going solo. When I returned to Africa 2 years later, I had more confidence to do the trip independently with our own vehicle. I had a better idea of what I was dealing with.''I think the key is to find a tour that specifically calls to what you want. If you want something adventurous and to be with people who are like-minded, pick one that really feels right to you.''Since I wanted to put something out there that I didn’t feel really existed yet, I created tours that combine adventurous elements as well as authenticity and a small group atmosphere. Our first one is in Peru''you can learn more about that here.''We’ll swim with these guys''Take care of your valuables''Carry a dummy wallet, use''gear that is theft proof'', and insure your belongings so that if someone tries to rob you, you’re not too worried about it.''Usually most unfortunate incidences around traveling just have to do with petty theft. By removing any resistance towards being robbed, you make it a lot easier on yourself to just enjoy your trip and not worry about losing your stuff (''more on my gear here''if you’d like to look at the travel insurance I use).''Remember that most of our greatest fears never come to pass''Here’s the thing – most of what you worry about is statistically unlikely to happen, and/or is something that you have direct control over.''You also have control over whether you end up going or not, but it would be a pity to miss out on something you’re dying to do because of fear.''So I hope that these tips help you to try out a trip, even just a baby one, so that you can see what you’re made of.''You got this.''Pin me!''READ NEXT: Everything you need to know about traveling alone as a woman''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Welcome back to another installment of''Solo Female Travel Stories,''where we share the stories of women who travel alone from all around the world.''While my advice on how to successfully travel solo is universal, there is no denying that I come from a privileged background and I cannot speak to the experience of every woman out there.''Previously, I’ve shared the solo experiences of a''not-so-young woman abroad'', to a''determined single mother'', to the brave ladies from''Kenya''and''India''who break stereotypes and travel fearlessly.''Today, I have decided to do it a little bit differently in order to provide multiple perspectives on one shared experience – what it is like to be a Muslim solo female traveler.''Admittedly, I do not know a lot about Islam, or Muslim culture. The mainstream media has done a splendid job of portraying the religion a certain way, and it has left me with a lot of questions about how life really is on the road for Muslim travelers.''Do other travelers treat them differently, or is it hard to find the right food or even the right place to perform their daily prayers?''So when I stumbled upon an interview of''Muslim solo female traveler from Indonesia'', I had to share it on my''Facebook Page'', and to my pleasant surprise, a number of people commented and shared their views on traveling solo as a Muslim female. I decided to reach out to a few of them to see if they would share more insights with us, and here are Hirni from Singapore, Majdouline from France, and Syifa from Indonesia’s stories:''Tell us about yourselves!''Hirni in Norway''Hirni:''I’m adventurous, unconventional, crazy and\xa0march to\xa0the beat of my own drums.\xa0I’d like to be known as someone who is able to inspire and motivate others. I am a solo female traveler who just happens to be Muslim. I do not feel any different from other solo female travelers I’ve met out there.''Syifa in Ningxia, China''Syifa:''I am a solo female traveler from''Indonesia''who runs a''YouTube channel''. I live in the Northwest of''China''now. When I meet someone new with my hijab on, I do not need to say I am a Muslim, as the hijab kind of speaks for me, though not everyone knows, some may think that it’s a nice fashion statement!''Majdouline in the Swiss Alps''Majdouline:''I am a very positive person, who has a strong interest in people. I am French born Arab, and I grew up at the German border in Strasbourg, studied in''Germany''and worked in London for a decade until a few months ago. I have started to travel around and go trekking a lot to be alone surrounded by nature lately.''What motivated you to travel alone for the first time?''Hirni traveling solo in Sapa, Vietnam''Hirni:''I’ve always been very independent but I would say a sense of adventure and fear of\xa0the unknown. The idea of''surrendering control to a certain extend and letting the universe assist you''are the things that helped to propel me to travel solo in the first place. That, and not having a choice!''My first solo trip was to Kuala Lumpur,''Malaysia'', as a teenager, because my parents were unable to go with me due to work commitments. I was lucky as I have family there, and my cousin hung out with me. I took an overnight train journey, and it was so much fun being on my own, being responsible for my own safety – I felt like a proper adult.''Syifa in Pai checkpoints, Thailand''Syifa:''I used Couchsurfing to meet travelers when I was back home in Indonesia, as I did not have the money to travel, and figured it would be nice to hear stories from travelers from around the world. I went on Couchsurfing’s website and hunted down travelers in Indonesia, and contacted them to meet up for a meal and a nice conversation. I traveled through their stories which helped feed my wanderlust, and meeting them motivated me to save up to travel myself!''The first time I traveled abroad alone was not completely for the purpose of experiencing solo traveling – I went to''Singapore''with 100 SGD with me, to visit my boyfriend at that time, but we broke up before we even met. I went anyway, and had to be creative with the limited amount of money I had. I was scared, but I took it as a challenge and even tried out Couchsurfing. The experience was exciting and empowering, and I have since then started taking more budgeted, longer solo trips.''Have you ever changed someone’s point of view about what it means to be a woman from your culture?''Hirni:''I may have opened up\xa0a couple of debates about it! I’m definitely not meek, subservient and pious. I have met some people in my travels who, when told where I come from (''Singapore''), did a double take. I even had someone said “no, you are not a Muslim. How could you be?”. This was in France, the US, and the Caribbean. I had to explain to them that not all Muslims are Arabs, and not all Arabs are Muslims.''When it comes up hijabs (covering up), it really depends on the individual. It may also be a cultural thing in some cases. If you come from a very conservative Islamic family, then the tendency is to dress modestly, just in case your third uncle from your grandma’s side of the family sees you walking down the street, God forbid, with your hair loose and walking beside your male classmate. However, these days, modern Muslims are mostly more relaxed about it. My cabin mate in Antarctica was Jewish. We realized we probably got along well because we are both not very religious, but we did talk about our religions and cultural differences.''Syifa in Sapa, Vietnam''Syifa:''When I went to Manila, my Couchsurfing host saw me with my hijab from afar, and immediately told me that he would transfer me to another house. When I asked why, he said it’s because his friend’s fiancee was a Muslim and thought that it would be more convenient for me. In Chiang Mai, I stayed with an American-British family, and I took part in their son’s school’s workshop about Islam. Throughout my travels, I have met so many western travelers who showed no hate, only curiosity on my religion, because they had little interaction with a Muslims prior to meeting me.''To be honest, I have been able to learn more about Islam from discussing it with them than back home. I can’t change how the world views Islam, but being able to share what I know is true for sure through traveling makes me very grateful.''Have you had to break down stereotypes and stigmas?''Hirni:''Since I do not really look “Muslim”, most people have no idea I am one, until I tell them so – usually when it comes to dietary requirements, or when they see my full name in my passport. Many people think that Muslims should be Arabic-looking, but most Muslims are from the Asia Pacific region, and not all of us look and dress alike!''When I travel, people who have never met a Muslim before get confused when they meet me, because I dress and speak in a “westernized” manner, and have my own thoughts and opinions about the state of the world, climate change, the uselessness of fidget-spinners, etc. A lot of people were really surprised when I told them I went to a Christian high school.''Syifa in Golden Rock, Myanmar''Syifa:''I definitely stood out in many countries simply because I wore a hijab. But I don’t think that I am breaking stereotypes by traveling solo. If anything, it has become an added value to me. My hijab often works as a conversation starter, and I have received so much kindness and understanding from people I have met. Interestingly, most, if not all of the hateful comments have come from my fellow Muslim brothers and sisters. I try my best to receive them with an open mind, and believe that they are looking out for me.''Majdouline:''People do not realized straight away that I am a Muslim, so sometimes they are surprised because they expect every Muslim to think the same and act the same. But we are individuals who are entitled to think and live our religion as we wish. In Japan, people were very surprised that I did not wear the head scarf so I like to show them pictures of my sisters and my aunty, we all accept each other as we are and no one is judging. 🙂''Majdouline’s sisters and their aunt''What are some obstacles you’ve had to overcome in order to make traveling a lifestyle?''Syifa:''When I first started traveling, I could only afford to go to the neighboring countries, where the currency exchange rates are not too different from Indonesian Rupiah. Money could be a problem if I were to travel to countries in the US or in Europe. However, I now use''workaway.com''to sustain my lifestyle. I have also started a YouTube channel to share my travels with people who are interested. Hopefully, I will be able to visit more countries that seemed impossible soon!''Majdouline:''Dealing with the number of days off that you get from work as I do not live in the same country than my family. My parents live in France\xa0and\xa0my grand parents in Tunisia, so I have to take time to see them while maximising my travels all over the world in a limited time each year.''What do you think the world assumes about women from your culture that is dead wrong?''Majdouline in Norway''Majdouline:''That we are expected to date or marry only muslim guys.\xa0Here\xa0is an example\xa0with the Tunisian\xa0\xa0legislation which has been amended this year:''“Tunisian women\xa0are allowed to married non- Muslim legally for the first time in 44 years, before if a Muslim woman wanted to marry a non-Muslim man, the man would have to convert to Islam and provide a certificate.”''In general, the world assumes that there is only one way to be a Muslim and that is not the case, I think that no one shall be an ambassador of a whole religion , we should only represent ourselves and our own convictions 🙂''Where have you been that you think is perfect for solo female travelers?''Hirni:''I would say in terms of safety,''Iceland''and Norway are way up there. As a female traveling on your own, you do not have to worry about being hassled. Iceland is easy to navigate but expensive for a solo traveler although it was manageable for me. Norway is perfect for the adventurous.''Seeing the Northern lights''should be on everyone’s bucket list!''I also backpacked alone around Brazil for close to a month. I bought an Air Pass and did Sao Paolo, Rio, Salvador, Manaus, Paintins, and Fortaleza. I enjoyed Festa Juninhas, and watching Boi Bumba in the Amazon (a carnival, but Amazonian style). Nobody really bothered me, but I guess I blended in pretty well with the locals. I had to''use my common sense when it came to safety'', of course. I also got tips from fellow travelers about traveling around Brazil.''For Muslims, we are most concerned about Halal food (which would make Denmark a less preferred destination right now). So if there is no Halal food to be found, we would have to stick with vegetarian food. Another important aspect is the ability to pray 5 times a day for most practicing Muslims. In non-Islamic countries, mosques and prayer rooms are rare, but you can always find a quiet corner to perform your prayers.''Majdouline''Majdouline:''I think that big cities are amazing for solo female travelers, I would suggest Seoul, Tokyo, NYC. Lisbon and Milan. I loved trekking and going to the wild but found it more challenges to do it alone whereas New Zealand or Corsica are great for solo female travelers.''What are some unexpected benefits of traveling alone?''Hirni:''You could always change your mind''if need be, should something interesting suddenly come up. For example, when the locals tell you of a party or festival that you could go to, you don’t have to check with your travel companions if they would want to go or not. It also pushes you to be more open and communicate with other people, be it locals or fellow travelers.''Finally, you could also go off-the-grid, off the beaten track if you wish to do so, without having to worry if your travel companions are comfortable with it. Basically,''you come first''!''Strangers are also more willing to help when they realize you are alone and may be a little “helpless”.''What is your advice to Muslim women who want to travel solo like you?''Syifa, motorbiking in Mui Ne, Vietnam''Syifa:''Don’t be afraid''. It’s scary to leave your comfort zone at first, but once you take the plunge to do it, and experience interacting with other travelers, you will realize that it is a lot easier than you thought!''Pin me!''***''I was encouraged and impressed to find that though stereotypes abound, these women have all had wonderful travel experiences that transcend outward differences.''Many thanks to these ladies for being part of this series! It’s so cool to hear from women from all over the world and from all walks of life about what solo traveling means to them, and to see that it can be enjoyed across so many different cultures.''Per usual, I’m amazed, humbled, and impressed by all of the women who are out there conquering the globe, and I’d love to share even more remarkable stories with you.''If you have a unique story to share, please''get in touch''.''READ NEXT: Solo Female Travel Stories: Wangechi from Kenya''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Berlin is one of the coolest cities in the world, hands down.''I’ve been living in Berlin for the past four years, on and off. So I’m biased, yes, but once you come here and experience it for yourself, you’ll surely also come to love the endless layers to this city – the fascinating history, the underbelly, the artistic vibes, and the cosmopolitan nature of it.''Berlin is affordable, gritty, incredibly green, and it seems that no-matter what kind of person you identify yourself as, you can find your tribe here.''During my time in Berlin, I’ve stayed in every neighborhood, sampled all kinds of cuisine, and sought a variety of activities \xa0that I previously could not have imagined existed. Here’s my ultimate, end all, be all guide to Berlin:''Things to do:''There’s so much to do, \xa0like really so incredibly much, that chances are you’ll have to make some tough decisions as far as what to see and what to miss. I tend to like to get off the tourist trail and to focus on things that are unique about a place. So with\xa0that in mind, the following are things that you can only do here:''The free stuff''Being dramatic about the rain at the East Side Gallery''East Side Gallery''Though this is firmly on the tourist trail, you can’t come to Berlin and not see the wall! This still-standing part of the Berlin wall that divided the city has been painted over by talented muralists and is completely free to walk along and gaze at, while trying to figure out what the artists were trying to convey.''Tempelhofer Feld''How many cities have an old repurposed airport where you can go fly a kite, barbecue on, and wind surf on the old tarmac? This is a fairly local experience, especially in the summer when you’ll see Berliners sunning themselves in the grass and having drinks together as the sun goes down.''The old airport is still intact as well, keep reading below to see how you can get inside!''Reischtag dome''The Parliament Building’s dome is Such a cool way to see the city day or night.''This is another touristy thing that is totally worth it. The parliament building’s glass dome gives you a beautiful panoramic view of the city and it’s open at night too. \xa0The walking platform circles around the glass dome while you listen to an audio taping in your preferred language and learn about various landmarks of the city – and it’s all free! I advise getting there for the sunset and watching as the city lights come on.''Register here first''.You’ll need to submit three times online, well ahead of time, that you are available to visit the dome, so plan this one into your schedule because it can get busy, especially in the summer months.''Bearpit karaoke''The Sunday''Mauerpark''flea market can be fun to visit, though in my opinion it’s overpriced. The best part about it is the open air karaoke that is free to attend and invites anyone in the crowd to come sing. \xa0It’s a surprisingly supportive crowd so if you’re itching to do it, give it a try!''Sunset at''Admiralbrücke''This is a pretty local thing to do in the Kreuzberg neighborhood and somewhere you’re likely to see me at sunset in the summertime. Most people grab a drink and sit on the grass, maybe playing cards or guitar, and enjoy the sun with their friends while watching the swans swim by on the canal.''When the weather is nice''Klunker kranisch''This rooftop bar has a three euro entry fee but when the weather is fine, it’s totally worth it. It’s got funky decor, live music most days, and on the deck outside there are plants, a rotation of quirky art pieces, and even a sandbox. I have spent many a summer day-turned-evening watching the sunset from this spot. To get there, take an elevator up to the top floor of the parking garage at the''Neukölln Arcaden''and as you come out of the elevator, bear left and you will start to see the ramp leading up to the bar.''Thai park''I couldn’t believe a Thai street food market existed in Germany until going there myself. If you want to have authentic, street-style Thai food, head to Thai Park in Charlottenburg on a weekend day when the weather is nice and you will see scores of people sitting on the ground serving up everything from Thai iced tea to pad see ew. Most dishes cost a standard five euros, so it’s pretty authentic except for the price! Still, not bad for Europe.''Note: There’s uncertainty at the moment about whether the park can continue due to lack of licensing.''Stay updated here.''Sunday flea markets''European flea markets have so many cool old treasures! \xa0And the ones in Berlin, in particular, are delightfully quirky. I love the ones at Urban Spree and Boxhagenerpltaz in Friedrichshain where I have found everything from a globe of the moon to candelabras to hang on my wall. You can find old books, records, genuine (used) fur coats for dirt cheap, and jewelry as well.''Badeschiff''This floating swimming pool on the river is a fun summertime activity and while touristy, it’s one of those things that is worth it anyways, and full of good looking people! Even if you don’t have a swimsuit, you can pop by the bar for a drink.''Walking tours''I’m usually not a big fan of city tours, but I have done a couple of''Alternative Berlin’s street art walking tours''and I absolutely love them. You get the combo of history and counter culture, plus they tend to attract some interesting tourists worth getting to know, especially if you’re traveling solo.''When it rains''It’ll happen''Vabali''Naked coed spas are a truly Berlin experience! Though this is not the only one in the city, it’s definitely the classiest and the best value for your money. You can pay extra for a massage, or just enjoy alternating between the pools of different temperatures in the saunas. My personal favorite is to go into the 95°C sauna and then jump right into the coolest pool right after and continue alternating. FYI,''Vabali''is a clothing-free joint and everyone is completely naked with no separation based on gender.''I was a bit apprehensive when I first went that people might stare at me, but it’s actually really nice to be in an environment where everyone is naked and it is not sexualized. It was refreshing to see how little it mattered that we were all in our birthday suits. It’s one of my favorite cold-weather activities now!''Tempelhof inside''Tempelhof’s check-in area''On Mondays and Wednesdays there are English''tours of the inside of the Templehof airport''. It feels completely frozen in time with almost everything left exactly as it was. You’re also completely free to walk behind the counters, sit on the conveyor belts, and wander through history while listening to a guide to describe the Berlin airlift and what each room was used for previously. I think it’s a pretty unique experience, and a great way to pass a rainy day in Berlin. Of which there are many.''Museum Island''The list is almost endless of museums to check out in Berlin. As an art buff, \xa0I tend to take to the streets instead and save my museum time for Paris and Amsterdam, but for those who love history, Berlin has a wealth of options on Museum Island.''Check it out here''.''The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe''Hauntingly beautiful to walk through''While I have not personally been to the \xa0museum connected to the memorial, this important part of history recognizes and immortalizes the atrocities that took place here, in an effort to never forget the past while working towards a more peaceful future.''The weird and amazing''Please check out Teufelsberg!''Teufelsberg''I think this is one of the coolest and most unique things to do while in Berlin. The old American spy base, now named Devils mountain, has been covered in art by some of the most prominent street artists around. The old listening domes create a unique aesthetic and it is also one of the best spots in the city to get an awesome view. The only way to see it is to take a tour.''More on that here''.''Urban spree''This urban space is one of my favorites to bring friends to because I love how the street is always changing, plus there is a rock wall, the largest indoor half pipe in Europe, a kung fu gym, and lots of places to see live music. There is also a flea market here on Sundays – \xa0that’s where I bought all of the furniture in my apartment too!''If you want to party''One of the most historic Beer Gardens in Berlin’s Prenzauer berg district.''It’s no secret that most young people come to Berlin because they have heard of the amazing nightlife scene. The party literally never stops. It’s totally normal to wake up at 6 AM on a Sunday morning and head straight to a nightclub and dance all day, or to enter on a Friday and walk out on a Sunday morning. Many of them have food inside so that you really don’t have to leave.''Most of them, intentionally, will cover up your cell phone cameras so that you can’t take pictures while inside, and I also don’t want to spoil the fun or the surprise. This you’ve got to see for yourself!''Berghain''If you are the party type, chances are you have heard of this club. It is notoriously the most difficult club to get into in Europe. It got its start as a gay nightclub and is known for its techno beats. The line is often hours long, especially in the summer.''I have been several times, and my secret is just to wear all black, don’t act too eager, and to go with someone who tends to get in often. They like familiar faces. If you don’t know anyone local, your best bet is dressing very casually, again in all black, and showing up alone. They tend to love it when people go solo. \xa0If you go in a big group, wearing heels, or wearing anything but black, chances are high that you will get turned away.''Live music''I am not a big techno fan, which makes many locals gasp in horror, but luckily there are always options!''so I tend to peruse''Songkick''for tickets for shows that I want to see instead of just going out and trying my luck at nightclubs.''Späti culture''When it is warm enough, you will notice that there are chairs and tables set up outside of the small convenience stores known as spätis.''It’s kind of like chilling at a small bar on the sidewalk, though they usually do not have bathrooms. However it can be a very social way to pass the time and it is not something I have seen elsewhere.''KitKat club''Since we are talking about nightlife, I can’t skip this institution of Berlin. KitKat is a place where people are as naked and sexually free as they please. There is a dress code – one should be wearing latex or nothing at all. If you are open minded and adventurous, KitKat can be a fun club to check out. There is even a swimming pool inside!''What to eat:''Glühwein (mulled wine) in a boot with meat and potatoes at a Christmas market''Cheap eats''Berlin is known for two famous cheap eats: Currywurst and Döner kebab. Both meals are just a few euros and can be found on nearly every street all throughout the city.''For the best ones, plus a few bonus cheap eats, check out''this post on Berlin’s best street food''.''International fare''Since Berlin is such an international city, you can find food from all over the world here and much of it is authentic and delicious. Best of all, food in Berlin is usually a great value for the amount of food that you get as compared to much of the rest of Europe, so eat up!''Rosa Caleta''– Jamaican Fusion''This restaurant has an ever-changing menu of flavorful Jamaican fusion cuisine. The combos are delicious and every time you go in there, you’ll discover something new on the menu. Bonus points since the owner regularly makes the trip over to London so that he can get access to fresh ingredients.''Sigiriya''– Sri Lankan''While you would be much better off getting delicious Indian food in the UK than in Berlin, there is a pretty good restaurant that serves up delicious Sri Lankan food, which has itsf similarities to Indian cuisine but has a lot of its own flavors and dishes as well. Their menu also goes into detail about each spice and how it complements the meal.''Tibet Haus''– Tibetan''This restaurant serves up food that reminded me of what I found in Nepal. For those who are looking for a taste of the Himalayas with warm dumplings (mo mos), delicious dhal soups, and a noodle soup called thukpa, this restaurant will make you feel like you’re high up in the mountains.''Angry Chicken''– Korean Fusion''This place is pretty small, so it’s not great for a relaxed meal out, but if you’re dying for fried chicken or bibimbap, angry chicken has flavorful and delicious fried food for cheap.''Hirsch''– Schnitzel''I’ve searched high and low and this tavern has the best and most affordable schnitzel in town. It’s also served up with a little bit of Spätzle, a soft egg noodle, and potato salad, Swabian style from Germany’s south. It’s not a fancy place but it’s cozy and friendly. Note that they open at 4pm.''Good Morning Vietnam''–\xa0 Vegan Vietnamese''This used to be my absolute favorite Vietnamese restaurant for its authenticity. Recently the restaurant went vegan, which is unfortunate because they used to have an absolutely delicious crispy duck breast, but I lament that it is still a good spot if you have a craving for Vietnamese food. It’s a little hidden so be sure to go through the courtyard to find it.''Al Andalos''– Lebanese''Every time someone visits me, I bring them to this Lebanese joint where you can get a teller plate large enough to serve three people for only €11. It’s a stone’s throw from\xa0Klunkerkranich and I highly recommend combining the two!''Yarok Fine Syrian Food from Damascus''This place is a recent discovery of mine and like Al Andalos, their teller plate is affordable and full of varied and delicious flavors incorporating flavorful spices, sauces, yogurts, and veggies.''The best cake''Germany is known not just for sausages, schnitzel, and beer, but for delicious cake, too. I’ve searched high and low and these are the winners:''Five Elephant''This coffee and cake shop is known for having the best cheesecake in Berlin and after sampling it myself five times I can verify that it is delicious but the next spot gives it a run for its money.''Zuckerbaby''This little unassuming bakery has the best cheesecake I’ve ever had in my life. And it’s vegan! I don’t know how they do it, but it’s mouthwateringly delicious, as are their other cakes and coffee.''Where to stay, broken down by neighborhood:''Where you stay in a city as spread out as Berlin will dictate a lot of your activities – or how long you spend in the train. I have a post with a lot more info on''each neighborhood broken down here'', but here’s a little bit of each one for you below:''Charlottenburg''This classy and quiet neighborhood in the west of the city is close to the main shopping street, Kurfürstendamm, Teufelsberg, and Thai park. \xa0It’s the first neighborhood I ever lived in and well, it is not my favorite, but it has a lot of higher and hotels and nice places to stay in.''Schoenberg''Similar to Charlottenburg, this neighborhood is quiet though it has a few more speakeasy-type bars and nice restaurants. While it is known as the gay area, the whole city is open, accepting, and free. \xa0I personally find it quite boring.''Kreuzberg''This is my favorite neighborhood in Berlin and where I currently make my home. It is a Street Art mecca as well as a melting pot of cultures. It is also one of the grittiest parts of the city with lots of bars, cheap food, and awesome things to do.''Mitte''Mitte literally means center. This is the most central and also one of the most touristy places to stay in the city. It is close to the famous checkpoint Charlie, Brandenburg gate, and Museum Island. Parts of Mitte \xa0are very corporate, like Walstraße (Wall street) and others are a bit more funky and interesting, like the area near Mauer Park. While thanks to its central location this might be a good place to stay while visiting, this is the only neighborhood I have not lived in, by choice. \xa0I find it lacks character.''Freiderichshain''This is my second favorite neighborhood in the city. Located in the former east, it’s where you will find the east side gallery, most of the night clubs, lots of great food, and a ton of other tourists. I love it for the world of things to do and the culture, but watch out for your belongings here!''Neukölln''This up-and-coming neighborhood is a mix of hipsters and rougher areas where cat calling is common. \xa0I lived there for a summer and for that reason absolutely hated it, but I do like to go back for Klunker Kranisch and the delicious Turkish food and vegan cake.''Prenzlauerberg''Also located in the former east, parts of this neighborhood have trendy restaurants and bars and other parts are much more family oriented. This is a nice, upscale neighborhood that has gentrified dramatically from its days under Soviet rule. It’s not my favorite nor least favorite neighborhood.''Wedding''This neighborhood is a bit rough around the edges. However several artists have studios here because the rent is cheap. It’s pretty far from most things a tourist would want to do, so I don’t see much point in staying here unless you want to be very close to Tegel airport.''After almost four years and lots of research, this is the best of Berlin from an (almost) local’s point of view.''Pin me!''The coolest thing about Berlin is, it’s always changing, and whether you’re here in the popular summer months or the cooler and darker winter, there’s a lot to discover and enjoy here.''This post is always being updated with new discoveries, and I’m open to what you find as well, so please leave a comment if you’ve got some favorites here that didn’t make the list!''READ NEXT: Where to Stay in Berlin''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Hello and welcome to my Berlin apartment!''Perhaps you’re thinking to yourself,''Kristin, did you not sign that lease over a year ago?''Indeed I did, but I only finished the final room – the photos in the hallway – last week, a full year and some change later.''Things move a lot more slowly since I’ve been\xa0away so much over the past year, with much of that time''unplanned.''I’ve had an on again, off again love affair with this city for years but I have been honoring my''commitment to stay in Germany''for two and a half months. Which, over the past five years, is longer than I’ve spent anywhere. I’m happy to report it’s been a welcome change. This place is my sanctuary, and it makes me happier than an apartment should make a person.''See the video tour here:''It’s a top-floor apartment in my favorite part of the city, which, if you have been following closely enough, you can probably figure out.''In addition to the skylights and the location, the thing I love most about this place is that apart from the IKEA bed which I only ordered for timeliness, all of the furniture in the apartment is secondhand.''The reasons were threefold: It’s much more friendly to the environment and the economy of Berlin when I buy secondhand and locally, and from small business owners. It makes me feel like slightly less of a jerk for all of those plane flights I take. Also, the place has way more character and personality this way! It suits my boho style so much more.''I could never have imagined until I started shopping how much fun it would be to go vintage to furnish this place. As an American, we do not have furniture this old and cool-looking at the flea markets back home! I was so delighted that I took it pretty far to the quirky end with my decorating style and I have zero regrets about it!''I mean, have you seen how I dress myself?''Exhibit A – Skeleton sweater and criss cross leggings. Dress up never dies.''Without further ado, here’s the place room by room:''The Gryffindor Room''Hats off to home improvement and lifestyle bloggers because how does one photograph and not make a room look crooked? Or is my place just crooked and I’m incapable of seeing it with my naked eye? Or my camera is magical and it makes things crooked that aren’t crooked? So many possibilities.''My friend joked that this room looks like it belongs to an octogenarian from''Charlottenburg''but''whatever'', to me it’s the Gryffindor room/my office/the living room.''In Berlin it’s fairly common for each room in a flat to serve as a bedroom and for the kitchen to be the common room. However I’ve come to realize that I have to have a separation between my office and my bedroom, or I’ll develop an unhealthy codependency with my computer.''This room has my favorite furniture in it, starting with the owl desk, which was the first thing I ever bought for this apartment. The room slowly became more and more Harry Potter-ish from there.''An oak desk! With not one, but TWO owls on it! Only €100 used.''The next thing was this baroque-style red velvet couch. Could you, would you, walk by this without buying it? I, for one, could not!''Additional finds include my globe of the moon from the ’70s, this whatnot from the same time, and a gorgeous map that was custom made by''Blursbyai.''Love this map, this chair, this rug, and my inner octogenarian.

We shall!”''Chamber of sleepings''In contrast to the Gryffindor room, this one has much more of an Asian-inspired vibe.

We all deserve oversized tiger feet.''The pillows in the meditation nook are from Thailand and China, and the furniture is all from the vintage shop where I bought my couches. The cow hide rug is a hand-me-down from a dear friend. The bed is never actually made (because what’s the point?), but I did it for you.''This room is a purple, blue, white, and wooden mix of my travel history.''The chamber of… eatings?''Am I taking the Harry Potter puns too far now?''Is there such thing?''Wait am I holding a coffee cup in like every photo?''Believe it or not, it’s not common for kitchens to come with the apartment in Berlin. Yes, seriously, you usually have to buy cabinets, a fridge, and all of the fixings when you move into a place. I was so happy that mine actually came ready to go, because if the three months I spent waiting just to have internet installed are any indication, a kitchen would have taken forever.''Details – the vase from a flea market, garden furniture I’ve turned into kitchen furniture, and a poster of Desiderata illustrated by Zen Pencils *link below*''I spend a lot of time in here, since I like to cook what I eat when possible. Watching the sunrise, coffee-in-hand and looking up at the stars from this window are favorite pastimes for me.''My morning routine consists of waking up, doing 20 minutes of meditation in the nook, journaling each day to set an intention, and making coffee to watch the sun come up. I don’t stay out late anymore. I don’t party anymore. I got old. It’s cool.''The Chamber of…showers?''The chamber of showers exists as well but it felt weird taking photos of a bathroom, even though my bathroom is glorious. However it is featured in the video embedded above, and it also has a lot of photos of nipples in it. I guess my apartment is all about freeing the nipple.''However I hid them in the video because I don’t want something like nipples to ban me from YouTube even though even cats have nipples and it’s fine to show a cat chest on YouTube, but whatever, right?''I digress.''That’s my place – it’s still a work in progress as I continue to poke around flea markets, a favorite Sunday activity, but for now, I can cross my arms, smile at the walls, and say it’s mostly finished.''Pin me!''Here’s where I got all of the stuff inside:''Liberty by''Anthony Kurtz''.''Boxhagener platz flea market''(only on Sundays).''Furniture is almost entirely from''WMK at Urban Spree''.''Map of the world is on''Etsy''.''The Desiderata poster is by''Zen Pencils''.''Please support these small business owners and artists if you like what you saw!''Thanks for hanging out with me.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Inside Berlin’s Tempelhof Airport''10 Cool Alternative Things to Do in Berlin''Why Teufelsberg in Berlin is a Must-do''Pin me!''I’ve lived in Europe for over four years now and during that time have had the pleasure of exploring lots of it myself, and have hosted several of my solo traveling friends who pass through my home city, Berlin.''Considering our favorites and remembering which places we disliked or wanted to avoid in the future, it usually came down to how safe we felt, how social it was, and how welcoming the locals were.''With that in mind, I’ve put together a list of some of the best places to consider if you’re traveling alone to Europe, and I asked a few of my fellow solo female traveling bloggers to share their favorites as well.

Whether out at a bar or nightclub or while taking one of the free walking tours, I find that meeting people in Berlin is easy. No matter what kind of person you are and what you’re looking for, you can find your tribe here.''Check out my''Germany guide''for more info.''Granada, Spain''Beautiful sunset at the Alhambra lookout point''“I loved wandering around the city centre in Granada, and felt safe even at night. It’s easy to make friends in hostels or even in bars, because everyone goes out for tapas and you don’t feel out of place standing or sitting alone at a bar having a drink and some food, as opposed to needing to have a whole sit down meal alone somewhere else.''Sonja in Alhambra, Spain''You can visit the Alhambra and spend as much time there as you like without having to worry about anyone else! Since it’s a more touristy area of Spain you don’t really need to worry about a language barrier either.” – Sonja of''Migrating Miss''Barcelona, Spain''Casa Batlló, known as the house of bones''“The cosmopolitan capital of Catalonia, Barcelona is the perfect place to visit if you’re a solo female travel.

I found some of Italy’s bigger cities to be stressful with all of the cat calling and the constant vigilance I had to keep over my backpack, but Bologna is different.

I even spent a night couch-surfing with the loveliest family in the mountains surrounding Porto who not only made me feel safe, but very welcome.

I can’t wait to go back and explore more of it someday.''Montenegro, All Over''Nina at Lake Skadar''“As my plane was landing at the Podgorica airport, I was already gobsmacked. Montenegro looked GORGEOUS! I booked tickets here on a whim without much of a plan and within moments, I was patting myself on the back. Montenegro is full of friendly people and I never at any point felt unsafe during my stay.''I traveled up north in the Tara region to adventure down the canyon’s rapids, down to Ulcinj to chill on the beach and hung out in the old city of Kotor. Prices were perfect, I had my own apartment with a sea view in Ulcinj for $23 USD a night (during shoulder season) and I had a two course meal with wine for 11 USD.

Belfast is a great spot to start your explorations from, especially if you are a''Game of Thrones''fan''!''Geneva, Switzerland''Beautiful Geneva''“I was drawn to the French Alps nearby, but thought the city itself was actually the perfect place for an independent trip (especially the first one), because it is a very international city, meaning you won’t feel out of place no matter where you’re from.\xa0Most people in the city speak English so communication is not a problem. While Geneva is known for being an expensive place, public transportation is free (if you stay in a hostel or hotel), and the city is also filled with water pumps you can use.''Victoria, all smiles in Geneva''Finally, there’s plenty to do in Geneva, even for a short break, and you get a city, lake, and mountain break all at once.” – Victoria of''Vic Advisor''Zermatt, Switzerland''Gorgeous Zermatt''For those who love the mountains and hiking, but don’t want to be on a trail all alone, heading to a popular area like Zermatt, Switzerland, can offer a nice combination of solitude in the mountains and people to meet.''On the popular trails, don’t worry, you won’t be the only one.

Avignon is a convenient and culture-filled destination in France’s Provence region.

The nice thing about skiing in Austria is how social it is, and how cheap it is to ski and stay there. I was blown away that a lift ticket for access to over three major ski areas and over 270km of slopes in Skicircus was only €51. The same ticket would’ve probably been pushing $200 in the US.''Austria also has a pretty unique Apres-ski scene, my favorite of which was called Goaßstall in Hinterglemm – a literal goat stall blasting German Schlager songs, which everyone likes to sing and dance to together. You’re going to meet cool people there. It’s almost a guarantee.''Check out my''Austria guide''for more info.''Prague, Czech Republic''Looking good, Prague!''“Prague''is a perfect destination for solo women, even for those just starting out. Of course, you still have to be cautious of your surroundings and not walk around drunk at night (even though I did that at a certain age), but overall, it’s very safe here. The public transport works great and Uber does too, so you don’t have to rely on taxis. Plus, you can easily communicate in English in most places. Prague also offers plenty of cool hostels where you can meet like-minded travellers.

The hill stands at 394 feet tall, and the ruins of Wehrtechnische Fakultät, a Nazi millitary college, still lie beneath the surface.''At one point,''it was a ski resort'', then it was turned into a “listening station”. Later on, David Lynch attempted to turn it into meditation centre, and now, it is the largest graffiti gallery in Europe''.''It’s also considered an area of rest.''In the words of the current lessee, Marvin Schütte, “We don’t want any parties or high life. This should be an area where you slow down.”''How did Teufelsberg evolve into a graffiti park?''In the early 20th century, the area was empty and lifeless. When the Nazis came into power, Hitler decided that it would make a good spot to build an academy on. The building was never completed, and after WWII, as clearance began to take place, the aforementioned debris piled up to be what’s now Berlin’s tallest hill, conveniently covering the college altogether.''Tension between the west and east Berlin during the Cold War saw the United States National Security Agency set up a watchtower called the “listening station”.''It is believed''that the global ECHELON network was developed there, to help the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada eavesdrop on the communist GDR.''An homage to the former residents?''Sounds so''James Bond'', doesn’t it?

However,\xa0Schütte has plans to breathe new life into it (whatever that means!).''The insane amount of''graffiti''is what draws visitors to the Teufelsberg today. Street artists from all around the world flock over to leave an artistic mark everywhere in and around Teufelsberg.

Doesn’t it seem beautiful to plan and save up together, for a common united goal and dream?''If your partner is fully supportive of your dream and you feel down to your core that it’s all good, and that you don’t need to worry about your connection while you’re gone, then give it a try. However I’m guessing you didn’t end up on this post because you feel that way.''What is the honest, real, and true reason why you and your partner are not planning this trip together? Consider the next question:''Is there a fundamental incompatibility?''Again, why isn’t your partner coming? Is she or he not invited?\xa0Is it because he or she is not interested in such things?''There will always be other, easy excuses like, money, school, or obligations. You probably had similar obstacles to overcome as well. We both know those are things you can overcome. But if traveling is not a priority to your partner, but it is such a huge priority for you that you are considering going off to the other side of the world without him or her, is this a fundamental incompatibility? Do you have different life priorities?''Your choices are not limited to, stay home with your current partner or leave and be alone forever and ever. Is there perhaps someone else out there who might share this desire to wander and therefore be more compatible with you?''You’ll be okay''Why are you considering taking off in the first place?''My traveling dreams really didn’t involve anyone else. I wanted to go for the freedom. Why did I crave this freedom so badly? I had to look at the conditions at home that were causing it.''This is not to lay blame or accusations on my former partner, it’s just to say that if I didn’t fully honor my desire to seek freedom, I might still be wondering what it feels like. The relationship would have probably come to an end anyway, but there would’ve been no beaches in Thailand, and no''Thousand New Beginnings''for me, then.''Is the decision based on fear or love?''So many motivations go back to the human desire for connection and to be accepted. However fearing that we will not have love again is in the end, acting out of a place of fear rather than out of a place of love.''Fear-based actions are usually selfish. is the decision to stay or go based on a selfish need to feel secure? It’s pretty hard to see it this way, I know, but be brutally honest with yourself here. If you stayed, who would you be doing it for, really? Do either of you benefit if you deny your strongest desires?''There will be more love''You are wonderful enough on your own''This is more of a statement than a question, but I hope that you know you’re wonderful without anyone having to tell you so. (But I’m telling you so, anyhow).''I didn’t know this at first.''I wrote early on''that I really didn’t like spending time with myself.''To be honest, this feeling persisted years into my travels.''I was sad that I didn’t have a partner'', mostly because I didn’t feel whole on my own.''I had no idea who I actually was – that’s why. I was just a mirror of the people who I was with, drawing my sense of self from their impressions of me. I had to be adored by those around me or I would feel shattered.''It was through traveling alone that I let that go, and I finally discovered who I actually am. My definition changes constantly, by the way.''I’m happy to report that I’m at peace in a way I haven’t felt before. I am deliriously happy to be on the other end of those feelings five years later,''with a business''and a new life that sprung from all of that. I feel so much gratitude to my former self for choosing the path she chose.''I don’t know if I would’ve arrived here without being single and''empowered by my solo adventures''for a good stretch of time.''I’m not saying that I chose the right path and that everyone should do things the way that I did. How can I know, right? The other path is lost to me now and all I can do is imagine how it would have looked. Sometimes I do, with rose-colored glasses, and other times I feel unbelievably relieved that I walked away. What I do know is that I am no longer looking for someone to complete me.''Settling down''is not my end goal. It never was.''And I have had great loves in the years since – ones that were better suited to me than the one I walked away from, crying and terrified.''My best advice is to be gentle and honest with yourself. Because for one of the toughest life decisions, or at least I’m sure it feels like that right now, it’s worth looking at the root of the feelings that come up and being fearless and truthful with your answers.''And though I don’t know you, I feel confident telling you that you will feel love again.''There will be dark moments when you doubt if this can be true. There will be times when you pine over your former love. It’s human nature. It’s what we do. But''you will feel love again.''Pin me!''And don’t forget that the person who deserves the most love in your life is you, and it’s going to be okay.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''The Big Question Girls Who Travel are so Tired of Answering''Why I Prefer Solo Travel (And Probably Always Will)''A Letter to My 21-Year-Old Self on My 31st Birthday''Hey guys!

Well I can think of about 101 reasons but since we both have things to do today I’ll narrow it down:''The coolest hiking on planet earth, along the trail of ancient Incan royalty and culminating with the sunrise over Machu Picchu.''A mountain that looks like a rainbow and has only recently become accessible, so we’re among the first to go (and get gorgeous photos with it).''Swimming with sea lions in their natural habitat.''Walking along salt pools that look like they came out of a pink design magazine.''Seeing tiny monkeys and PINK DOLPHINS and poison dart frogs.''Ceviche''Ceviche and Pisco sours''Ceviche and Pisco sours and saltado.''Staying at the highest rated, and Zika, Malaria, and Yellow Fever-free ecolodge in the Peruvian Amazon''Having tea while looking at this mountain you just climbed (strapped in, safely, and suitable for beginners – no worries!):''Can I just move in?''It will be amazing to discover Peru together, to show you how I approach a place for the first time and to teach you how to ease into travel so that if eventually (or immediately afterwards!) you want to venture off on your own, you have the skills you need to do just that.''I also thought it was imperative to make sure that the organization was taken care of, so that’s why I joined up with Pete Kornmeier of Spark Expeditions to make this happen. He’s led adventure tours on six out of seven continents, including several in Peru.''You can see the detailed itineraries here.''What makes this tour special?''This mountain, for one.''The last thing this world needs is another tour that’s just like the others, shuffling you around from place to place with no soul or purpose.''So I knew that what I created had to be something I was dying to go on myself: something adventurous, with a huge nature element, that involves ethical and local operators, and that I would come out of with amazing pictures – with a lot of emphasis on that last point TBH!''Most tours will take you to Machu Picchu or the Amazon, but they won’t have the extras like Rainbow Mountain or the Salinas de Maras, or a photographer around (me!) who is dedicated to helping you get amazing photos. It’s also all about the dynamic and the people you’ll meet, right?''On this tour you’ll be with other readers of this blog who are also into traveling adventurously, plenty of whom are solo travelers, and who want to connect over this incredible shared travel experience. It’s nice to get all of that on a trip that you don’t have to worry about planning.''More info here.''Swim with these guys''So who is Pete?''I’ve been wanting to do tours for a while. I knew that I had a lot of ideas and an energy that I could bring to the tour business but I also wanted to ensure that I worked with the right local operators and had someone along who is a trained mountain guide. A few companies have reached out over the past year but none felt right until I took one of Pete’s trips and saw what they were all about.''This all goes back to when he reached out about a year ago to see if I wanted to collaborate.''I was wary, who was this Pete guy? I told him, after about two hours of''interrogation''polite phone conversation, that I’d love to come out to Alaska and see what one of his trips was like, and we would go from there.''Alaska was awesome.

The first is focused on hiking and camping along the Inca Trail, Rainbow Mountain, and doing via ferrata (which is like clipped-in rock climbing – sounds scarier than it is – it’s so much fun!) in the Sacred Valley and a few other awesome surprises including an astrophotography workshop with me while we’re out camping. It starts on April 13 of 2018.''Week two will take us to the ocean to swim with sea lions, then deep into the Amazon at the top-rated ecolodge in the reserve with a higher biodiversity than any other in the area. We’ll have the chance to see marmosets, poison dart frogs, pink river dolphins, and a bunch of other animals from the''Amazon Trail''video game (am I really the only one who played that?) starting on April 21, 2018.''Each week is priced at $2300 individually, with a $600 discount if you opt to do both.''Check out the full itineraries at this link''.''Here’s what you get''For each week, we negotiated with companies that are ecologically sound, and have guides who Pete already knows are good, ethical guides.''In other words, we aren’t going bottom-barrel, dirt cheap. We want quality and to be putting our money into the right hands.''For the hiking portion, each person gets an individual porter.''We wanted to make this more accessible for everyone. Most companies charge a big premium for this but we’re including it in the total price.''This price includes absolutely all activities, so there are no surprise fees for participating in all aspects of the tour. We won’t nickle and dime you for every little thing. What you see is what you get!''The ecolodge we are staying with is the best one in the area, and one of the only ones in a Zika, Malaria, and Yellow Fever-free zone.''We got many of these options for huge discounts that aren’t available to the public, passing the savings onto you.''Most tours that include photography help are stupid expensive!

My mother is my biggest hero and taught me what it meant to persevere in the face of adversity. She taught us to be independent and strong.''I also love to have fun. Whether it’s listening to a live band, eating great food, watching a movie, or laughing with my girlfriends, I live for opportunities to surround myself with people and places that make me happy. And of course, where would life be without traveling? Traveling has broadened my horizons and given me so many incredible opportunities.''What motivated you to travel alone for the first time?''Tree swinging in Bali, Indonesia''It was actually heartbreak and sadness that motivated me. I was growing increasingly unhappy with my profession-I was a school counselor in the New York City Department of Education for over 10 years and it really became too much for me. I felt very burnt out, I wasn’t enjoying my work anymore, and didn’t feel like I was helpful anymore to the students with whom I worked.''I was also growing very tired of living in the New York City area. New York City is an amazing place and I had many years of pure fun living there. But I was at a point in my life where I wanted to be surrounded by more peace and quiet. I wanted more space to stretch out. I wanted to start a family and lay down roots.''Right around the same time, I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years. It was due to a very unexpected event and I was completely blindsided. No other word but heartbroken can describe how I felt. While I was trying to make sense of what had just happened, I just kept getting an image in my head of me going to''Thailand''. I couldn’t shake it! Something in me kept saying, “I need to just get away.” It wasn’t a feeling of wanting to run away, but a feeling of truly needing to''get away in order to heal what I felt was broken inside of me''.''At first I treated these ideas as crazy, I couldn’t just take off-I have a big job! But then I started talking about it to others and they thought traveling was a great idea! They said, “go Ruthie, get away, explore, see the world, do it!”\xa0 And that started giving me more confidence that this could actually be a good idea.\xa0 Soon, the idea of Thailand turned into maybe visiting''Vietnam''too. And then it grew to the idea of''visiting Southeast Asia''.''And well, I guess you could just say the rest is history! I don’t regret anything I did.''Quitting my job was the best decision''. I think once a career stops bringing you fulfillment and contentment, it’s time to search for something new. I wish I had done this sooner. Traveling alone gave me the opportunity to be free, truly free for the first time in my life. It helped me heal.''Which misconceptions did you have about solo travel that you now realize were untrue?''Seeing the temple ruins in Angkor Wat, Cambodia''People thought I couldn’t possibly have as much fun [alone] as if I was traveling with someone else. A part of me was definitely apprehensive about traveling alone for so long. I worried about safety, especially after reading other women’s experiences written about on different travel websites/blogs. But then my wise older sister said to me, “you’ve survived living in New York City for the past 15 years and you’ve learned to take care of yourself so you’ll be fine taking care of yourself in Asia.”''She was right, I was tougher than I thought!\xa0That was all I needed to hear to calm my fears! There were 2 other misconceptions that I had about solo traveling: that''it would cost a lot of money''and that I would be the only female doing it! Neither of those misconceptions were true and I quickly found out that I could travel very frugally. Especially in''Southeast Asia''where the cost of traveling/living was very low, it was easy for me to afford food, lodging, transportation, and activities. I also couldn’t believe how many other women I was meeting that were also traveling solo. Sometimes we would join forces and travel together but for the most part, we all enjoyed traveling by ourselves.''What are some unexpected benefits of traveling alone?''So many! I truly wouldn’t travel any other way. I tell people I would rather travel alone than travel with others that I’m not close with. Here are some of the things I loved about it:''Being able to go where I want to or don’t want to without having to consult anyone else!''Being able to change plans at the last second just because I felt like it.''As a solo traveler, you’re often added to larger groups of people for things such as tours or excursions. This gives you''the chance to meet people you may never have had the chance to meet''if you were already in your own group of people. Oh the people I met along the way! So many wonderful faces and interesting people!''People you meet think you’re just simply amazing and incredible for traveling alone. The compliments and kudos I received from others along the way really helped me maintain my confidence for what I was doing. Because at times, I would get lonely and needing reminding that what I was doing was really awesome.''Now that I’m back in “the real world,” whenever I face a challenge or adversity that I doubt my ability to handle, I remind myself of the adventure that I took for 6 months of traveling alone. I remind myself that not only did I survive that experience, but I absolutely loved it! I remind myself that I’m strong enough to have left my entire life behind and traveled alone for 6 months. If I can do that, I truly can do anything!''Nothing gets to scare me anymore after I’ve remembered what I have already done.''What was your favorite moment?''A great day spent with the elephants at an elephant sanctuary in Chiang Mai, Thailand.''There’s a song that I used to listen to a lot while traveling, it was Sia’s “Bird Set Free.” During my travels, I detoured from SE Asia and went to''New Zealand''for a month. In my opinion, New Zealand is one of the most spectacular places I’ve ever seen! One day, I was driving down a deserted road that hugged the rugged coastline. I was overwhelmed by the utter beauty of what I was seeing.''At the same time, this song was blasting on my stereo. I was so taken over by the emotions of this song, the beauty of what I was seeing, and just started crying. I let out this guttural scream because right at that moment, I felt like I was the bird that was set free. It was the most momentous part of my trip for me because it was right then and there that I realized how truly free I was,''how I set myself free'', and I was at my happiest. Until this day, when I hear that song, I cry out of happiness because it truly represents what my trip was all about, being a bird that was set free.''What are some obstacles you’ve had to overcome in order to make traveling a lifestyle?''Christmas Day in Penang, Malaysia''Traveling is not my lifestyle, unfortunately. I eventually had to come home and come back to reality. However, money was definitely an obstacle I had to face. I was lucky that prior to my trip, I had saved money for many years and was able to live off of that. Preparing to leave your life behind also had its own obstacles. My apartment lease was up right before I left and I had to put all my belongings in storage. I also had to find a home for my car while I was gone. There were a lot of details that I had to figure out and plan in advance such as what to do with my mail, how to pay my recurring bills while I was gone (ie car insurance, cell phone, etc.), and how to get access to months of medications.''But none of these were impossible! My biggest support were my family and friends. I had to ask for help and that was difficult for me. Don’t be afraid to ask others to help you. It’s ok to ask for favors.\xa0 My point is that nothing is impossible as long as you take a little time to''do the planning''.''One of the obstacles I did face sometimes while traveling was loneliness. Even though I met people wherever I went, there were still times I would''feel lonely and miss my friends/family back home''. What helped me was to find a few things that made me feel better on these days. I would treat myself to a massage (which in SE Asia is pretty inexpensive!) or go see a movie-you can always find one either in English or with English subtitles. Like magic, it helped me feel better.''How did Be My Travel Muse help you?''Get the Guidebook for Solo Female Travelers!''Be My Travel Muse was a great website for me to use during the research phase of my''trip planning''. I spent about 4 months actively planning my trip and a big portion of that planning consisted of learning all about traveling alone as a female.

I felt it prepared me very well for what I was about to experience.

However I could have gone to greater efforts to cook my own food, and it wouldn’t have hurt if I laid off the ice cream and nightly wine, either.''Eating whole foods – mostly plants: The easiest way for me to drop weight is to stop eating carbs that don’t occur from whole foods. So I allow lentils, beans, and sweet potatoes, but cut out bread, pasta, and sugars that don’t come from fruits and other whole foods.''Allow a cheat day: It’s still important to enjoy myself, so cheat days are allowed! Sampling the local cuisine, even the unhealthy stuff, is part of the travel experience. I just limit it more than I used to.''Finding exercises you really enjoy: Find that thing you look forward to.

It’s empowering and even though I’m sore for almost a week following each class, I can tell I’m getting way stronger with each passing week.''Working exercise into travels: Make your vacations active ones! I love to go paddling,''like in Manitoba'', and swimming, diving, and hiking. In cities in Europe, I walk. I always look for ways to make a trip active, for the nature and for my body. I’m not gonna lie, it helped tremendously that over the summer I had two more or less back-to-back 8-day treks, one in''Kyrgyzstan''and one in''Alaska''.''Alcohol: I probably owe most of my previous weight gain to my drinking habits. Now that I really think about it, I was having at least one drink almost every day when I was traveling, but usually more. I haven’t had any alcohol for over three months now (but that’s another post entirely).''Spent three days canoeing – a good workout in a gorgeous place!''Apart from all of these things, the biggest thing of all was knowing why I was doing it, and why getting healthy was important apart from aesthetics.''I really wanted to be stronger. There are a lot of sports that I love doing – like through multi-day hiking where I am carrying roughly 30% of my body weight, and diving where again, I am carrying pretty heavy gear, and recently, pole dancing.''All of these things have a high potential of injuring me if I am not strong enough to do them.

Luckily when it comes to Berlin, it doesn’t take long to get out of the city and into the middle of nowhere.''The area surrounding Berlin, Brandenburg, is quite rural, heavily forested and gorgeous. Spreewald is a local favorite for its intense greenery, pickles (for real), and little canals to canoe and boat on.''I’d seen images of its incredible greenery and water so calm it looked like a mirror, so when the weather turned nice this October I decided to take a chance and see if it might be even better with fall foliage.''So satisfyingly calm''Is it worth taking a day trip to Spreewald?

This was much better than an organized tour because it gave me ultimate flexibility.''I just wish I had arrived much earlier and spent the whole day out there.

Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but you can get away from most of the people if you just rent your own canoe or kayak.''Get away from it all''Most people also stick to Ledhe, the quaint little village next to Lübbenau where I rented my kayak. They usually disembark and get a coffee or a beer at one of the restaurants on the water and don’t explore beyond that.''Cute Ledhe''When I rented my kayak, the little map suggestion that the guy made was incredibly short so it seems to me that most people are probably not looking to explore very far and would rather just relax. By going beyond Ledhe, you’re pretty much guaranteed much smaller crowds and by going in the off-season and not on the weekend, you absolutely will have plenty of time and space to yourself. It just gets better the farther out you go.''So. Darn. Cute.''The scenery in the quaint little towns – the lakefront houses with wells, little boats, quaint bridges and flowers – is lovely.

After a bit of research, it looked like Lübbenau was my best bet.\xa0I decided against spending the night because the hotels are a bit expensive and I like to sleep in my own bed when I can.''It takes about an hour to get there from Berlin, and my ticket cost me just under €12 one way, which I bought directly at the station before boarding the train. From the train station it was about a 10 minute walk to the town center and another five minutes to where I rented the kayak from''Bootsverleih Richter''. I paid €10 for two hours.''Trains leave the city half hour early, some from Lichtenberg and some from the main central station, Hauptbahnhof, and passing through Alexanderplatz, Friedrichstraße, and Ostbahnhof every hour.''Check timetables here''.''Spreewald is the perfect contrast to Berlin – calm, quiet, quaint, and relaxed. The more I paddled, the more I appreciated it.\xa0In the beginning of my kayak adventure, I was thinking that I didn’t get the hype about Spreewald and that it was bit too touristy for me, but as I progressed I found that I actually really enjoyed the trip and was able to get some solitude. I’m already thinking of going back in the winter just to see it in different seasons, grateful to have an easily accessible nature escape so close to Berlin.''The town of Lübbenau also has cafes, ice cream shops, places to buy pickles (natürlich!), some shops with fashion from, I’d say the early ’00s, and a lovely little church.''Spreewald, I’m glad I discovered you.

You’ve already made an excellent choice by choosing Berlin. This city is so many shades of cool, unique, and fascinating, I’ve been hooked for almost four years now.''During my time here, I’ve lived in almost every neighborhood. I’ve seen it all – the good, the bad, the exciting, and the boring.''While most major cities have their various boroughs that come with their associated personalities, nowhere is that as evident or as heavily contrasted as in Berlin. The vibe and personality can vary wildly just from kiez to keiz (that’s Deutsche for ‘neighborhood’).''In a city as spread out as Berlin, choosing the neighborhood that puts you closer to the things you want to see and the vibe you want to experience is key. This guide will help you figure out which one is for you:''Kreuzberg''I love the parks in this ‘hood in the fall (Photo by''Gareth Leonard'')''For lovers of street art and grit''Kreuzberg is a street art mecca and a cosmopolitan mixture of cultures. You’ll find lots of foreigners here, as well as English-speaking bars and coffee shops. It’s an area rich with counterculture, a vibrant party scene, and some of the coolest things to do in the city. The only time this neighborhood seems to sleep is at 8am on a Sunday morning.''After much firsthand research, I’ve found that this is my favorite neighborhood and it’s where I currently make my home. I love the energy and personality of it!\xa0It’s also on the gritty side –''keep a close eye on your purse!''Kreuzberg Things to Do:''Take a walk:''The''treehouse in the wall''in Kreuzberg''If you love street art, just take a walk, particularly between the Schleisiches Tor and Kottbusser Tor ubahn stops. There is street art and fabulous people watching everywhere. The image above is of the famous treehouse near Mariannenplatz, which was built before the wall fell, right on the border, and still stands today.''Görlitzer Park:''This park is queen of contrasts. I absolutely love it for the relaxed summertime vibe when people chill out and play frisbee on the grass. Yet it’s also nearly impossible to walk through the park without being offered drugs, and what blows my mind is you will also see a petting zoo there, people walking their dogs, and kids running around. It all seems to work in this curious park.''Admiralsbrücke:''This is a favorite local hangout when the weather is fine, and especially during the summer, when the sun goes down. People grab a drink from a nearby shop and play guitar while dangling their legs over the canal.''Neu West''This creative space has cafes, galleries, and pieces of the Berlin wall on display. It is relatively new, hence the name, but worth checking out if you’re passing by for those who love street art. Across the street you’ll also see one of the biggest squatter communities in the neighborhood, but they’re not super keen on visitors.''Oranientstr''This lively street is full of hipster bars and international cuisine generally offered cheaply. Start your weekend night here and migrate over to Friedrichshain as it gets later. Nearby, pop over to\xa0Markthalle Neun for the Thursday night street stall market and monthly breakfast markets.''Stay:''I suggest an''Airbnb''or if on a budget,''JETpak Alternative Hostel''.''Kreuzberg personified: The tattooed hottie with fierce style who writes poetry in your neighborhood coffee shop, freelances for a living, and pole dances for a workout.''Friedrichshain''Being dramatic about the rain at the East Side Gallery (Pic by''Brenna Holeman'')''For action lovers''Just over the bridge from Kreuzberg, this neighborhood in the former east of the city holds most of the night clubs, pretty good food, and a lot of really cool street art. Most young tourists end up staying here since it is so close to where the action is. I like this neighborhood for the cool flea markets, variety of international eats, and nightlife.''Friedrichshain Things to Do:''East Side Gallery:''This still-standing part of the Berlin wall, while\xa0in a super touristy area, is free and absolutely worth seeing. Walk along the re-painted parts of the wall and catch the sunset on the river Spree.''Berghain:''This club is notoriously the toughest to get into in the world. You will regularly see a queue of several hours, most of whom will be turned away at the door. The real secret to getting in is dressing down, mostly in black, and not acting like it matters too much to you whether you get in or not. They tend to like familiar faces and locals, so pulling up on a bicycle might actually help your case, as does going in alone. You’re almost guaranteed to get turned away if in a big group. Is it worth the wait? While I think it is a cool club, it’s not the coolest I’ve ever been to, and you’ve got to love techno!''Boxhagenerplatz:''I decorated my apartment almost entirely from the flea market hauls at Boxhagener platz. Flea markets in Berlin can be an event in themselves with all manner of funky jewelry, secondhand fur coats for cheap, and super old-school finds like candelabras and the globe of the moon from the ’60s currently sitting on my desk.''Urban Spree:''A piece by my favorite street artist, Jimmy C, at Urban Spree''This area has an ever-changing array of cool street art, a free art gallery, the largest indoor half pipe in Europe, a rock wall, various music venues, cafés, and restaurants. Whenever a friend comes to visit me, I bring him or her here. There’s also a flea market here on Sundays!''Stay:''I suggest an''Airbnb''or if on a budget,''Sunflower Hostel''(It’s close-ish to Berghain).''Fshain personified: The friend who you always call to go clubbing, because he knows all the bouncers in the city.''Mitte''THE Berlin landmark – Brandenburg gate (Photo by''Brenna Holeman'')''For museum lovers''Mitte translated literally means center, which is accurate considering the central location of this neighborhood. There’s a ton of interesting history here, as well as some of the more upscale areas and corporate offices. While far from my favorite neighborhood, I can’t deny that the central location is helpful, especially if you’re mostly interested in museums and some of the more typical sites like the Berliner Dom and Brandenburg gate.''Mitte Things to Do:''Checkpoint Charlie:''Confession, I have never actually been here. It’s a bit too touristy for me, but this marker between East and West gives you a peek into the past and an opportunity to take photos with guards who are dressed up and standing at this famous checkpoint.''The Reichstag (Parliament Building):''This is a pretty cool free thing to do in the city and gives you a panoramic view from way up high in the glass dome.''Register for free online''ahead of time. I suggest going at Sunset and watching the City lights come on.''Museum Island:''This is where, you guessed it, many of the museums are! It’s also close to where you’ll find the Berliner Dom and most of the casual tourists in the city. It’s not a place I frequent but on a rainy day, it can be the perfect spot to spend some time indoors marveling at art and history.''Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe:''Hauntingly beautiful to walk through (Photo also by Brenna)''Near the Reichstag, you’ll find Brandenburg gate as well as the\xa0Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, characterized by concrete slabs of varying heights in a grid form, plus the names of 3 million Jewish Holocaust victims. This is one of many memorials in the city, but certainly one of the most striking and haunting.''Haus Schwarzenberg:''Haus Schwarzenberg''This spot has street art pieces from the big names, the Anne Frank Zentrum, and touristy shops nearby. It’s not a secret spot by any means, still, I like bringing friends to visit here so that they can see some of the most prominent street artists in the city.''Stay:''An''Airbnb''or if on a budget, the''Generator Hostel.''Mitte personified: A guy or a girl who wears a suit, is perfectly manicured, and works in an office building.''Neukölln''Tempelhof''For the alternative crowd''Neukölln has a lot of redeeming qualities though parts of it, like Hermannplatz (I know, I lived there), are rowdy, dirty, and better avoided. Part hipster with vegan restaurants and part up-and-coming neighborhood with rough edges, it’s got a charm to it, again, in parts.''Neukölln Things to Do:''Klunkerkranich:''This rooftop bar is covered in plants, quirky art, and even a sandbox. It’s a bit tricky to find since it’s on the rooftop of a parking lot in a shopping mall, but it’s worth it for the live music, awesome view, and perfect summer chill space. Entrance is 3€.''Tempelhofer feld:''Once Europe’s busiest airport, Tempelhof closed its doors in 2008 and became one of the largest public spaces in the world. Join a BBQ, kite surf on the tarmac, or''take a tour of the inside'', which is the only way to get access indoors nowadays.''Berlin spoken word:''This is something only locals know much about, but if you dig poetry head to Du Beast on Thursday nights for''Berlin spoken word''and read or sing something you’ve written. You might see me there! Entrance is 2€.''Stay:''Airbnb''or''hotels''. If on a budget,''hostels''(but seriously, not at Hermannplatz).''Neukölln personified: The hipster in tight pants with a beard he’s put a lot of effort and thought into, who’s picking up free stuff off the sidewalk.''Prenzlauer Berg''One of the most historic Beer Gardens in Berlin''For a cleaner version of the former east''Once a place where artists squatted when the wall came down, this neighborhood has gentrified though it still has a lot going for it in terms of shopping, great restaurants, and cafes. Most of my friends love this neighborhood but I still harbor what is probably an unfair resentment after my bike tire got caught in a tram track and sent me flying.''Prenzlauer Berg Things to Do:''Kastanienallee:''This is the street for bars, cafes, and shopping in this ‘hood and is fairly well-connected to the rest of the city as well. If you’re looking for a place to stay, this street could be a great choice because it’s cleaner than the other neighborhoods we’ve discussed, and less touristy than Mitte, though still very close by.''Mauerpark and Bearpit Karaoke:''On Sundays, check out the flea market at the Mauer (wall) park and the famous bearpit karaoke, which is an open air karaoke that invites anyone and everyone to sing. Truth be told, the flea market is a bit overpriced, but this area of ‘Pberg’ has a lot of character, and plenty of cafés and restaurants nearby.''Stay:''Airbnb''or''EastSeven Berlin Hostel''.''Prenzlauer berg Personified: A once-broke artist who now owns a gallery and has a young family.''Charlottenburg''Not in the ‘hood but close by (Photo by''Mike Corey'')''For higher-end shopping and to be closer to transport hubs''This classy and quiet neighborhood in the west of the city is close to the main shopping street, Kurfürstendamm, Teufelsberg, and Thai park. \xa0It’s the first neighborhood I ever lived in and while not my favorite, it has a lot of higher-end hotels and nice places to stay, plus it’s close to Berlin Tegel Airport and the main bus terminal. If you’d prefer a less touristy area, and without the grit of other places out West, consider Charlottenburg.''Charlottenburg Things to Do:''Thai Park:''This seems so random to me, but when in the summer months when the weather is nice, a bunch of Thai people gather on the weekends and sell street-style Thai food that is delicious and authentic. Almost everything costs about €5, and after you purchase, sit on the grass and enjoy! Check the''Facebook group''to see if it’s on. Unfortunately, at the moment, it has''come under fire''for selling food without licenses, much to the chagrin of Berlin locals. Stay tuned!''Kurfürstendamm:''Shortened to Ku’damm, this street is where you’ll find Rolex, H&M, Desigual, and most of the other major retailers that you can think of. This street is typically full of tourists but if you stay near Wittenbergplatz (which is more in Schöneberg, discussed below), you will be well-connected to the rest of the city and in a pretty classy area.''Teufelsberg:''This is not in Charlottenburg – it’s actually in Grunewald, which you’d never want to stay in. Therefore Charlottenburg is the closest of the core neighborhoods to where you’ll find what I think is the coolest thing in Berlin. This abandoned old American spy base is now full of art by almost all of the major players, and you could spend hours exploring, climbing, and running around this curious place. It’s a must-do!''Stay:''An''Airbnb''or a nice hotel on''Ku’damm''Charlottenburg Personified: An old granny who is hip enough to live the city life, or a younger person who just wants more space in a classy ‘hood for less money.''Schöneberg''Schöneberg is Berlin’s gay district, with lots of history of major musicians, like David Bowie, hanging out there while the wall was still up. These days, the coolness factor has largely moved away from this ‘hood and most of the popular gay bars have moved as well. If you come here expecting a Haight-Ashbury or West Hollywood vibe, I think you’ll be disappointed. That said, it’s a cleaner and nicer version of some of the other hip Berlin neighborhoods.''Schöneberg Highlights:''Nollendorfplatz:''Though most of the city’s''best gay bars''aren’t in this ‘hood anymore, for those looking for''fetish hotels/apartments'', sex shops, and bars, this is still the place to be.''Goltzstraße''This quaint street has lovely cafes and more laid-back, classier bars than you’re likely to find in Kreuzberg and Fshain, and an overall cleaner and quieter atmosphere. Basically, you can walk to a bar without being offered drugs here.''Stay:''An''Airbnb''or one of the classier''hotels near Wittenbergplatz''.''Schöneberg Personified: A stylish 30 or 40-something who lives in a nice building and walks a dog that wears a sweater.''Those are the core Berlin neighborhoods, and some of the best things to do in each. That said, after four years of living in this city, I keep discovering new things, old things disappear, and the city keeps changing at a rapid and exciting pace.''As long as you pick a place to stay that suits your interests, and you commit to coming back again and again, you’ll get a chance to peel back the onion layers of this city and maybe finally say, “I get it” one day.

Now she’s 18 and attending college 3 hours away, so my ability to travel is really picking up. I’m also financially able to quit one of my jobs now and will be doing so at the end of the year.

It’s also really helpful when Kristin writes about tour/guide companies she uses in her travels, for example her''Canada camping trip''. Pretty much all of her articles on her''Mozambique trip''were awesome and super helpful. I knew literally nothing about Mozambique and then I learned I could''stay in a private bungalow for $15 a night in Tofo''thanks to Kristin. Don’t even get me started on''Gorilla trekking in Uganda''! I really don’t think I knew that was something you could do before seeing Kristin do it. Obviously, it’s on my bucket list now. Kristin has helped me feel even more''empowered to travel solo'', follow my dreams, and start living my life more for myself instead of others all the time.''***''Stories like Becky’s are the very reason why I decided to start a column like this.

It’s like suddenly everything else blurs and even though your feet are on the ground, your body seems like it has floated to somewhere else. These ‘aha!’ moments really inspire and motivate me and since we last talked about it, I’ve been searching for more.''I love asking people whom I respect and admire which books have changed their lives. A couple of years ago, I''shared a list that you guys seemed to really connect with''(and I have gone back and reread a few of those, and somehow they were completely different books the second time around!). So here’s another list of books that changed how I think about things, caused me to pause and reflect a bit more often, and helped me approach business in new and exciting ways:''Tiny Beautiful Things: Advice on Love and Life from Dear Sugar''By Cheryl Strayed''Most people know Cheryl Strayed from the book and subsequent movie,''Wild''. Though I haven’t read that book nor watched the movie, I did at least know a bit about her from all of the hype surrounding it when I picked up''Tiny Beautiful Things''.''Strayed was once an advice columnist writing under the pseudonym, Sugar. It was an unpaid gig that she did so brilliantly, drawing from her own difficult experience and being so raw and vulnerable in her responses, I couldn’t put it down. I cried a lot, I laughed a lot, I saw myself in so many of the pages, both in the question askers and in some of her answers. Sugar isn’t your typical advice columnist, she just might change your life with her tough love and no-b.s. answers that so clearly come from a life overflowing with richness in experiencing the tough things, and the tiny, beautiful things.''Powerful quote:''I suppose this is what I mean when I say we cannot possibly know what will manifest in our lives. We live and have experiences and leave people we love and get left by them. People we thought would be with us forever aren’t and people we didn’t know would come into our lives do. Our work here is to keep faith with that, to put it in a box and wait. To trust that someday we will know what it means, so that when the ordinary miraculous is revealed to us we will be there, standing before the baby girl in the pretty dress, grateful for the smallest things.''The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business''by Charles Duhigg''This book came up on my Kindle recommendations list and I knew I had seen the title over and over, and that it had been recommended to me once or twice, so I bought it.''This book is not just eye-opening, it’s incredibly engaging and well-written.''It mostly focuses on individual stories while continuously driving the point home that we are creatures of habit and at some point our habits just take over and become our lives, like something as small as biting our nails or something as damaging as smoking cigarettes or gambling. However by being mindful and identifying said habits, we have the power to change them by replacing certain actions at the right point in the habit loop. I read this in January and every now and then I catch myself in a habit and try to come up with ways to change it. Maybe old dogs can learn new tricks.''Powerful quote:''The way we habitually think of our surroundings and ourselves create the worlds that each of us inhabit. “There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says ‘Morning, boys. How’s the water?’\xa0” the writer David Foster Wallace told a class of graduating college students in 2005. “And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes ‘What the hell is water?’\xa0” The water is habits, the unthinking choices and invisible decisions that surround us every day—and which, just by looking at them, become visible again.''The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life''by Mark Manson''I reference Mark a lot on this blog, and he was the one who led me to''Tiny Beautiful Things''as well.''I don’t agree with absolutely everything he says but I connect with most of it, particularly this book. It’s a much-expanded version of one of his most popular''blog posts by the same title''.''This book reminds us that feeling bad sometimes is part of the human experience, and that by always seeking happiness or pleasure, we are dissatisfied with anything else. Yet life does not exist in the extremes, but rather in the middle. By giving too many fucks about the wrong things, we make ourselves miserable. This book goes through all the ways in which we take ourselves on emotional rollercoasters, incorporating ideas from Buddhism, modern philosophers like Alan Watts, and psychology as well. Mark knows his stuff, and he really shows it in this book while making complex topics relatable and funny at times.''Predictably, it also has the word ‘fuck’ in it constantly.''Powerful quote:''We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change. We have evolved to always live with a certain degree of dissatisfaction and insecurity, because it’s the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that’s going to do the most work to innovate and survive. We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have.''You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life''By Jen Sincero''I saw this book on a friend’s coffee table and when Audible was all, “hey, you’d like this based on the other stuff you read” I was all, cool sounds like the perfect''road trip''companion. And since I was by myself and feeling particularly empowered out in the desert on those backcountry roads, listening to this book narrated by Jen Sincero herself felt particularly poignant.''Her message is clear: Dream so big that it scares your friends and makes people uncomfortable. Then take the actions to make that dream come true. Trust. Trust in the path you’re on, make your relationship with money a good, healthy one, and know that you are, as the title suggests, a badass.''I implore you to listen to rather than read this one. I love when authors narrate their own books and Jen does a fantastic job of really driving the point home. She’s not just an author but a motivational speaker. Listen to it in transit. Make that time work for you.''Powerful Quote:''You are perfect. To think anything less is as pointless as a river thinking that it’s got too many curves or that it moves too slowly or that its rapids are too rapid. Says who? You’re on a journey with no defined beginning, middle or end. There are no wrong twists and turns. There is just being. And your job is to be as you as you can be. This is why you’re here. To shy away from who you truly are would leave the world you-less. You are the only you there is and ever will be. I repeat, you are the only you there is and ever will be. Do not deny the world its one and only chance to bask in your brilliance''The Power of Now''Eckhart Tolle''How did it take me so long to discover this? I was familiar with impermanence and the importance of focusing on the now rather than worrying about the past, which is over, or the future, which has not yet arrived but I didn’t really''get it''. Really, all we have is right now. Easier said than fully followed and believed, right?''If you only pick one book from this list, make it this one. I also highly suggest listening to it as opposed to reading it, as there’s a bit more to this version than in the book version – like some questions and answers. I think it really adds an element to it that helps us to understand Tolle’s point, especially when some of the advice is hard to swallow.''Powerful quote:''Time isn’t precious at all, because it is an illusion. What you perceive as precious is not time but the one point that is out of time: the Now. That is precious indeed. The more you are focused on time—past and future—the more you miss the Now, the most precious thing there is.''Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers''by Timothy Ferriss''Most people would probably fangirl if they saw Tom Hanks, but I would fangirl much harder if I met Tim Ferriss. His writing has changed my life, starting with the''Four Hour Workweek''. Based on his podcast,''Tools of Titans''is an even heavier hitter with the daily habits and most-recommended books and suggestions from professional athletes like Shaun White, spiritual gurus like Tony Robbins, and like everyone else you’ve ever wanted to hear from. Tim manages to get almost everyone to talk to him and spill the beans.''What amazes me is how much of what works for one person is the opposite from another, like people who swear by waking up early and people who admit to being night owls. Yet some tools almost seem universal, like meditation. What will you pick out of it that helps you lead a more impactful and meaningful life? This is one I’ll read again and again.''Powerful quote (from Tony Robbins paraphrasing Warren Buffett):''Investing in yourself is the most important investment you’ll ever make in your life.\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. There’s no financial investment that’ll ever match it, because if you develop more skill, more ability, more insight, more capacity, that’s what’s going to really provide economic freedom.\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. It’s those skill sets that really make that happen.''The War of Art''by Steven Pressfield''The War of Art has been going around the entrepreneur and creative professional circles for some time now and when the same friend who had recommended''Essentialism''(''from the last list'') to me suggested this book, I picked it up without questioning it.''This book is fantastic for those of us who do creative work. How often have you hesitated to do something because you were afraid it wouldn’t be good enough, or wouldn’t be received with the glory we artists tend to crave? It’s a short but powerful read, and helped me to identify areas where I had resistance towards reaching goals. In many cases, I hadn’t realized it was there until I read this.''Powerful quote:''The professional keeps his eye on the doughnut and not on the hole. He reminds himself it’s better to be in the arena, getting stomped by the bull, than to be up in the stands or out in the parking lot.''Conquering Mountains: How to Solo Travel the World Fearlessly''by Kristin Addis''Is it okay if I list my own book? Maybe it seems strange to do so, but this book quite literally has changed my life, and the lives of so many women who have read it. I’m so humbled by how it has taken off and helped women to build up the courage, savings, and skills to get out there and take on the world solo. I love that when nobody in a woman’s immediate circle is supporting her, she can find encouragement in this book.''Powerful quote:''And by the time I finished, I realized that while the formula changes a bit from person to person and region to region, everyone basically has the same fears and comes up against similar opposition before our travels. All we have to do is just muster up the courage and go. That is the most important step.''While I’m still far (far, far, far) from perfect, those are some of the books that have changed me for the better recently. Learning and growing is a lifelong practice, and that’s why it has been so good to go back and re-read some of the books I connected with in the past as well, as the new person I am today.''I hope that somewhere in there, you find something that you connect with. I’d also love to hear from you about what books, podcasts, or websites have changed your life.''We’re on this journey together, after all!''Pin me!''Happy reading.''*By the way, some of these links are affiliate links, and if you purchase through said link, I will get a tiny (like honestly minuscule barely perceptible) small kickback at no extra cost to you.

Many of them only travel a few times per year now, and for much shorter periods.''I have burned out from time to time and just wanted a little bit of time in one place, but for the most part I cannot sit still. Even when I am at home, I need to be doing something, whether it’s working, going for a walk, doing the dishes, or drinking water.''Any kind of downtime is torturous to me. I don’t have the capacity to be lazy. I never did.''If you have been with me for a while, you will notice that I have announced that''I moved to Berlin''. And then I was almost never here. I signed a lease for an apartment I am almost never in.''Oh yes, I am most definitely running.''Over the past couple of months, I stopped to ask myself why. Like any addiction, it is a form of escape, and movement has become mine. But why?''What am I trying to escape from?''Many wonderful things, when consumed in moderation, can be healthy. Like a glass of wine, chocolate, exercise, and healthy fats.''Travel is, too.''It can be incredibly empowering.''But I also don’t want to abuse it. I don’t want to sink into an addiction without asking myself hard questions about why.''And so from now until December I am doing something I have never done before: staying in one place.''If we were to have had a conversation about it in the past, I would have told you that’s what I was doing around this time last year''when I was in California''. But I was still going on little trips all the time: to''Northern California'',''Canada'', and''Idaho''.''My then-boyfriend was taking me to the airport constantly. I wasn’t really sitting still.''I don’t fear forming deep connections with people. In fact I long for it.''Plus,''I love the city of Berlin,''and I’ve gone through''a lot of effort''to be here.''It’s time to sit still for a little while. It’s time to ask myself why everyone else burns out, but I don’t.''It’s time to ask: What am I running towards? What am I running away from?''And until I have a clear answer, it’s time to stay put. Even though everything in me is fighting this decision, I’m doing it so that I have a clear enough ‘why’.''Because there’s nothing wrong with running, but it is only healthy in moderation – something I’ve always been spectacularly bad at.''Berlin, I’m stoked to hang out with you for a while. It’s long overdue.''What do you think? Is traveling a form of escapism? If so, is there anything wrong with that?''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Sober in Southeast Asia: An Impossible Mission?''I Gazed Into A Stranger’s Eyes for 45 Minutes and This is What Happened''Ladies, Take Back Your Power''Backpacking in the Alaskan backcountry has been one of my favorite outdoor adventures to date.''I saw moose, a wolverine, a bear, and almost no other people with the exception of another group far in the distance and the occasional bush plane.''Alaska also came with its own set of challenges and special equipment that I needed in order to remain comfortable. I experienced all kinds of weather while on''my 8-day hike''in Wrangell St. Elias National Park, from snow to days so sunny that I stripped down to my tank top.''I thought the equipment I’d already used in''Patagonia''would suffice, but I’m so glad that I listened to my guide and upgraded to waterproof and colder weather gear.''Here’s what’s on my list (Scroll to the bottom for the bulleted list):''Errythang''A legit sleeping bag''I’m sorry, I know that a lightweight sleeping bag that keeps you comfortable in super cold temps is crazy expensive. Chalk it up to absolutely every sport getting expensive once you get more into it.''That said, a warm sleeping bag is by far the most important item, and every single ounce matters when you are carrying everything you’re going to use, plus a bear can and crampons.\xa0Seriously, if you can’t get warm, you’ll just be miserable and it could even be dangerous! I bought the''REI Coop magma sleeping bag in long''(I’m 5’8 so the regular is too short) and I’m in love with it.''A legit sleeping pad''Oh man, this makes such a big difference too! I had a crappy one in Patagonia and not only did I feel every tiny rock and tree root, it did nothing to keep me warmer.''The''Therm-a-rest sleeping pad''I used in Alaska is super lightweight and it will keep you nice and warm. I would suggest getting the long version if you’re tall, as I got the regular and my feet hang off of mine a little.''The right backpack''Get a backpack that’s meant for hiking. It’ll have the right straps for putting on axes, if you need them, as well as crampon straps and a fit that’s meant for constant wear. It’ll be lightweight as well.''This is super important to try on in person, with weight in it. If you’re doing a longer hike like my 8-day backcountry experience, you’ll need a pretty big pack. Remember, you want to be able to fit everything inside so that nothing gets wet considering the varied weather you’re likely to encounter.''This is the closest bag to mine'', since REI doesn’t make what I had anymore, but again, please try this on in person if you can.''Also make sure that your bag has a rain cover! You’ll be using it plenty in Alaska.''Hiking boots with real tread''Get you some good boots!''The first pair hiking boots I bought — to replace my old pair that had holes — were off of Amazon. All of the reviews were stellar but I realized these were from people who had never hiked before, and certainly weren’t taking on terrain like one encounters in Alaska.''There wasn’t a trail in Wrangell St. Elias where I went, and if you’re truly in the backcountry, there won’t be for you either. You’ll be walking mostly on rocks, through rivers, and over wet, marshy ground. Get boots that can handle that! I tested and recommend''these by Ahnu''.''Close-toed camp shoes''Not flip flops''I’m from Southern California and flip flops are my religion. Shoes are foot prison, am I right?''I previously brought along flip flops to put on when in camp, but in Alaska, that’s a very poor choice.''The ‘campsites’ are just where you end up parking for the night, and usually you’ll encounter lots of rocks, wet ground, and a multitude of opportunities to slip right out of flip flops and stub your much-needed toes. My''KEEN whisper camp shoes''are lightweight, mostly waterproof, and as dorky as I used to think they looked, they are completely necessary in Alaska.''A light but resilient tent''My humble abode''I used to think that my''two-person MSR tent''was the shit. This tent offers a good amount of space, but it also acts a bit like a sail when the wind is strong. Make sure that you use the ropes on the sides and secure it to rocks in case you encounter a strong storm, like the snow I encountered.''I’m still going to use this tent, but there is probably a better option out there with a different shape (think lower and flatter).''Waterproof gloves''For the love of God, get waterproof gloves for hiking in Alaska! My hands would have been freezing constantly if I didn’t have gloves that were waterproof. They still were wet quite a bit since my gloves weren’t the best, but my hiking buddy said his hands stayed dry with his''Sealskinz gloves''.

So it was goodbye Berlin, and hello again, California.''It was beautiful at first. I hadn’t felt that magical high since my very first love, before I knew what heartbreak felt like.

I slipped into meditation and back out of it, all the while keeping my gaze on her eye, switching from left to right when it felt right to.''I felt cradled each time she smiled, and safe each time she shifted slightly but still maintained my gaze.

And why not? With their beautiful beaches, paradisiacal infinity pools and lush green rice paddies its clear to see why they are at the top of most Indonesian travellers bucket lists. But those looking to escape the tourist haunts, you only have to look a little further to the island of Flores.''Nestled to the East of Lombok, Flores is still somewhat of a hidden gem! The Komodo National Park, which lays just off the shore is awash with enchanting''Instaworthy''landscapes and is home to the infamous Komodo Dragon, but its not just the landscape above the surface that is worth checking out. With an abundance of manta ray, diverse species of shark, turtles, untouched corals, drift dive opportunities\xa0and unimaginable\xa0underwater landscapes complete with a dive site with more species of fish than the entire Caribbean, its easy to see why the Komodo National Park is believed to have some of the best dive sites in the world!''For those looking to explore the island, there are several direct flights each day from Bali to Labuan Bajo. Labuan Bajo is the main hub for tourists and the once sleepy harbour town has been transformed into a bustling haven for dive fanatics and adventurers.''The accommodation in the town is very basic compared to other parts of Indonesia and is largely made up of guest houses run by the friendly locals, but we’d caught wind of a new dive school that had opened and with the underwater world on our mind, we checked in!''Coming for the airport our driver took us on the ten minute journey down the winding narrows roads until we saw our home for the next 10 nights perched at the side of the road.''Dragon Dive Komodo''. The dive resort is somewhat more modern and stylish than any other in the area and it’s facilities blew all of our expectations out of the water. We were shown to our room, one of the decadently designed six bedroom dorms sat on the edge of the 12m pool. Its trendy poolside bar, cosy chillout areas, harbour views,\xa0pool tables and not to mention the amazing\xa0home made pizza oven\xa0make the hostel a haven for those looking for a place to relax, socialise\xa0and enjoy the many wonders of the Komodo Islands.''Although only open for a few weeks, there were plenty of dive enthusiasts eagerly anticipating their next dive fix along with backpackers keen to explore the craggy hills of Padar Island.''We’ve first started diving last summer in Gili Trawangan where we were first introduced and mesmerised by the underwater world. Just over a year later, our one off experience has now turned into a passion and we have accrued more than eighty dives between us in some of the best dive sites of the world. But no matter where we drop our fins, there is always one location on any divers lips, Komodo!''Renowned for its natural wonders, untouched coral,\xa0teeming wildlife and\xa0adrenaline fueled\xa0currents we were excited to experience one of the top dive sites in the world for ourselves, however, no one could have prepared us for what we were about to experience.''Setting sail we cascaded through the dragonesque landscape and snaked through the backdrop of jagged peaks\xa0and razor sharp crags. With the dive sites located\xa0an hour away from the town, we made ourselves comfortable on the plush top deck lounge\xa0as we tucked into a breakfast of donuts and pastries, while drinking in the view of the National Park.''With over 30 known dive sites we were spoilt for choice, but after much discussion we decided on Mawun, a site renowned for its manta “cleaning station” and having never seen manta before, we were hoping to get lucky and have our first encounter.''Sinking below the surface, we admired the effervescent\xa0corals and bright fish that danced past us. But just a few more meters below the water, we saw the signal we had been hoping for, manta! In every direction! We watched in awe as these beautiful giants of the ocean gracefully\xa0flew past us, elated, as they swooped and pirouetted. We savoured their elegant movements as they soared through the water.''We resurfaced with wide eyes and high fives. Euphoria!''With the first dive site seemingly hard to beat, we descended our second dive site Batu Balong, a reef home to more fish than the entire Caribbean put together, a real life underwater aquarium! Countless\xa0fish, flooded the waters in every direction!\xa0After an exhilarating forty-five minutes under water, the oxygen in our tanks was almost at an end and we were beckoned to the surface in a flurry of excitement. We could have stayed down forever!''The following day we rose early, making our way to the local pier where our boat men waited. As the sky turned to a perfect shade of pink, we tucked into donuts and coffee on the roof of our vessel, watching several other small boats come into view, all seemingly heading in the same direction as us. Two hours into our journey, the craggy rocks of Padar Island came into view. We jumped off the boat and made the for the top of the hill. Our early start was generously rewarded with views over the entire island, including its three distinctive beaches, one pink, one black and one white. We marvelled at the view from the top, drinking in this natural phenomenon that so few have experienced.''Whilst travel always has a habit of leaving us speechless, no place we have visited has done so like the Komodo National Park.

Julia and I travel because we crave the personal growth that comes from discovering places and cultures that are new to us., and backpacking on the Via Dinarica Trail allowed us to do exactly that.''From playfully hurdling language barriers via impromptu games of charades, to navigating grocery stores and shops filled with unfamiliar foods, to absorbing spontaneous mountainside cheesemaking lessons (and drinking sessions), we found Balkan culture in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro to be an outpouring of warmth, hospitality and kindness.''The geography of these countries is also breathtaking. After trekking to guesthouses that served fresh, homegrown, farm-to-table organic meals, to homes of complete strangers who generously allowed us to camp in their back yards, and meeting a dog who adopted us, we were already talking about when we’d be back to hike more of this spectacular trail.''Mt. Maglic''Our 10-day route on the VDT took us through 138 km (86 miles) of the Dinaric Alps, totling an elevation gain of about 8,000 meters (26,200 feet). We started in Bosnia-Herzegovina at''Sutjeska National Park''and ended in Montenegro just shy of''Biogradska Gora National Park''. A few of our days were quite flat, but most had steep ascents yet moderate descents. The breathtaking terrain ranged from dense pine forests, to flower carpeted mountain pastures, to alpine zones dotted with emerald lakes, to forest-ponds teeming with fish.''We didn’t hire a guide, as we love the thrill of navigating trails on our own, even if it means getting into some minor pickles. Given the fact that the trail is occasionally difficult to follow, we did indeed get into a few tough spots, but with both our GPS and paper maps, we ended up just fine.''In a sentence, we highly recommend this stretch of the Via Dinarica Trail. This wellspring of cultural experiences as well as sheer natural beauty is still largely undiscovered by mainstream tourists, so go as soon as you can.''Here is our itinerary:''Day 1:''Suha''to''Prijevor Huts''on Mt. Maglić (in Sutjeska National Park) – 5 km (sleeping elevation: 1692 m) (''VDT Stage 37'')''Valley up to Prijevor Huts in Sutjeska National Park''We started trekking in Sutjeska National Park via the Suha entrance. We spent the majority of the day picking our way up the left side of this valley, and we didn’t have to worry about protecting ourselves from the sun, as the old growth forest provided us with ample shade. Had we not been in the cool shade of the trees, the steepness of this section of trail would have been significantly more challenging than it already was.''First Glimpse of Maglic''In the blink of an eye, the trees ended, and towering before us at 2386 meters (7828 feet) was Mt. Maglić, Bosnia-Herzegovina’s highest peak. Standing at it’s base, I was acutely aware of how small I am in relation to our beautiful world and universe. Simultaneously however, I was peaceful, calm and completely clear in my mind. The medicinal power of mountains is miraculous.''Pano of Prijevor Huts''By early afternoon, we arrived at the Prijevor Huts. Each hut sleeps 6 people, has a toilet, running water and best of all, a wood burning stove. For me, there are few things more enjoyable than slowly drifting off to sleep in a cozy mountain top cabin while being gently warmed by a wood burning stove. And that night, that’s exactly what we experienced!''Cheese making with Randovan''The next morning, Randovan gave us a cheese making lesson. We met Randovan the previous afternoon and learned that he is a herder who seasonally lives and pastures his flocks near the huts in his katun (a summer cottage in the mountains used by shepherds in the Balkans). During the lesson he milked his 8 cows, boiled the milk (letting us taste the hot milk at the various stages along the way) and then showed us how to make about half a dozen different kinds of cheeses.''All the while, he fed us fresh soft chunks of freshly finished cheese, and he gave me shots of plum brandy, loza. Although I wasn’t particularly keen to take shots at 9:30AM, I didn’t want to be rude, so I did my best to refuse as politely as possible, but I must admit, by the time we started hiking about an hour later, I was a little bit buzzed and and most certainly full with cheese. Radovan’s hospitality was second to none.''Day 2: Prijevor Huts to''Mratinje''-13 km (sleeping elevation: 1200 m) (''VDT Stage 37'')''Bluberries at the roadside''The next day we hiked down to the road, and we found some locals selling fresh picked mountain blueberries! For a little more than US$1, we snacked on a couple of pints!''Reservoir Near Martinje''To make a LONG story short, we had to take a bus to Martinje where we hiked along this aqua marine beauty of a reservoir. The moral of this story is make sure to get mountain border crossing permits''before''you head into the hills.''To find out why we were not able to cross the border from Bosnia-Herzegovina into Montenegro through the mountains, how to get those mountain border crossing permits as well as a number of other essential planning and logistical tips (such as how to get the GPS coordinates for the trail, the essential gear you’ll need, and how to navigate the locals) make sure to check out''12 Things to Consider Before Hiking the VDT''.''Entry to Martinje''Naturally, the town Martinje is near the Mratinje dam. It’s a quaint farming town nestled in this mountain valley.''Although we planned to camp by a mountain lake this night, we ended up camping in this person’s yard! On our way to the lake, one of the local men communicated to us that the lake was too far off to reach before dark. We didn’t want to risk losing the trail (some sections were not well marked), so we asked the man where we might be able to spend the night. In an instant, he gestured to this driveway, so we set up camp. Then a moment after we had finished, he left! A few minutes later other people arrived at the house, and we realized that the man must have told us we could sleep in his neighbor’s yard! We found this hilarious in retrospect, but a little awkward at the time. Oh well.''Day 3: Mratinje to''Farm House''– 12 km (sleeping elevation: 1250 m) (''VDT Stage 38'')''Mratinje Dam''Hiking out of Mratinje, we had to cross the Mratinje Dam through the Piva Canyon. If you’re scared of heights, close your eyes on this part, as you’ll be 220 metres (720 ft) above the river! But if you’re not, you’re in for a scenic treat.''Getting from the base of the dam, up to the Piva Plateau, we had to complete a MASSIVE climb. Much of the time we scrambled up rock slides and extremely overgrown sections of trail. Make sure you have GPS capabilities for this section.''Super lost in Piva Canyon''And when we say ‘massive’, we really mean it. From the dam to the plateau, we''would''have climbed 650 meters (2,100 feet) in 1.6 km (1 mile), if we hadn’t gotten terribly lost. But, we did get terribly lost, and we ran out of water. Our GPS was a savior in this situation (we weren’t quite yet at point of needing to use our paper maps and compass). So again, we really recommend you have GPS capabilities for at least this section of the trail and better yet, for the entire thing.''Arriving at the Farmhouse in the Nick of Time''By this point, we were quite dehydrated, and there were dark clouds quickly moving towards us, but we made it to this farmhouse just before it started to rain. This home is listed on the VDT website as a place to get water, but the elderly couple living here were kind enough to let us camp in their yard. Thankfully we were able to rehydrate and set up camp before the storm. While we were setting up our tent, they even brought us hot coffees and a beer! Trail magic like this is always the best.''Day 4: Farm House to''Guest House Nedajno''– 18 km (sleeping elevation: 1400 m) (''VDT Stage 39'')''The Piva Plateau – Heading into Nedajno''The Piva Plateau is STUNNING! Its rolling hills are dotted with fresh green farms and fade into distant mountains, forming a seemingly endless carpet of pastoral beauty.''Guesthouse Nedajno was one of our favorite stops along the trail. This family owned and operated guest house has a capacity of ~15 guests, so it’s a small and intimate place as well as a great one for getting a real taste of Montenegrin culture. It’s also very affordable. For one person’s meals (which were massive, we probably could have shared) and accommodations we paid just under €20 (US$23).''Organic food at Guest House Nedajno''Guest house Nedajno serves scrumptious organic food. From meat dishes, to cheeses, to vegetable ones too, they can accommodate just about any dietary needs.''Guest House Nedajno’s home cooking''And again, their portions are MASSIVE. This plate of''Ćevapi'', a type of skinless minced meat sausage, potatoes, homemade cheese and lamb soup (not pictured) was for one person. By the end of our meal here we were not only stuffed, but infinitely satisfied.''To top the sheer deliciousness and size of the meal was the fact that everything they serve is organic and sourced from either their own backyard or from within 1.5 km (1 mile) of their guesthouse. We only spent one night here, but we wish we had planned to spend a few more.''Day 5: Guest House Nedajno to''Planinarski Dom Mountain Hut''(Škrčko Jezero – Durmitor National Park) – 13 km (sleeping elevation: 1800 m) (''VDT Stage 39'')''Although we descended quite a bit while trekking to the bottom of Sušica canyon, the entire hike down was via a mountain road, so it was quite gentle on our knees.''Durmitor National Park''At the bottom, we reached the entrance to Durmitor National Park. The entry fee was €3/person, so it was a good thing we had some money with us.''Within Durmitor, we headed to Škrčko Jezero (lake). The climb up to the lake was pretty grueling, but it switch backed enough to keep us from having to take too many breaks. Indeed, slow but steady pacing worked perfectly for us here.''Nearing Škrčko Jezero''As we continued to gain elevation, the scenery became increasingly breathtaking. Little did we know at this point that the next day we’d be going nearly straight up the wall you can see on the left.''Škrčko Jezero''And then finally, we made it! Refreshing, cool and crystal clear, Škrčko Jezero is quite possibly one of the most beautiful alpine lakes I’ve ever seen. We went for a swim, lounged in the sun, and savored the accomplishment of hiking all the way up there.''Planinarski Dom Mountain Hut''To our surprise and delight, Planinarski Dom Mountain Hut had room for us to stay that night! We had planned to camp out, but we wanted to get an early start for a big climb we had the next morning, so we decided to sleep in the hut and thus save the time of breaking camp in the morning.''Day 6: Planinarski Dom Mountain Hut (Škrčko Jezero – Durmitor National Park) to''Žabljak''– 13 km (sleeping elevation: 1300 m) (''VDT Stage 39'')''Škrčko Jezero in the Morning''As planned, we got up early, passed by Škrčko for one final goodbye, and then we started to climb, straight up.''Ascending Mt. Planinica''While Julia looks quite happy at this resting spot, I must admit that we were both pushed nearly to our limit on this ascent up Mt. Planinica. We climbed 610 meters (2,000 feet) in 1.4 km (0.9 mile). This was by far the most challenging stretch of trail on our trek. Later on, we found out there are more gentle routes up Mt. Planinica. Oh well.''However, the hardcore climb up Mt. Planinica was well worth the views at the top. They. Were. Stunning! And the weather could not have been more perfect. Off in the distance, we could see Žabljak, the town in which we’d take a zero day (a rest day), so with a bit of extra pep in our step, we made the 7 mile descent into town. This one was markedly harder on our knees though, and by the time we arrived, we were ready for an extended rest.''Day 7: Zero Day in Žabljak – 0 km (sleeping elevation: 1300 m)''Black Lake in Žabljak''On our zero day in Žabljak, we slept in late, ate lots of good food and took a gentle stroll around Black Lake. Flitting around without our packs was luxurious, and the lake was gorgeous! I sure love hiking, but zero days are fantastic too.''Day 8: Žabljak to''Zminica Jezero''– 14 km (sleeping elevation: 1300 m) (''VDT''Stage 40'')''A Dog Adopted Us''After a zero day in Žabljak, we were resupplied and nicely rested, so we hiked onward. On our way, this dog started following us. We didn’t think much of it, as there were a good number of other farm dogs we’d seen along the trail.''Picking Berries on the Via Dinarica Trail''While we only took one picture of these wild mountain strawberries, we could have taken''dozens''more. The section we hiked on the Via Dinarica Trail was thickly lined with strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries. No wonder this is Grizzly country.''Zminičko Jezero''After a relatively effortless 16km (10 miles) on flat terrain, we arrived at Zminičko Jezero. The picture above is indeed of the lake, but it was taken the next morning. The night we arrived, we were quite abruptly greeted by an intense thunder and lightning storm. Think ‘discotech’ to understand how much lightning we experienced. Frankly, it was terrifying, but there was nothing we could do other than stay low in our tent and hope for the best. Clearly and thankfully, we made it out unscathed, albeit a little wet.''Day 9: Zminičko Jezero to''Guesthouse Zabojsko Jezero''– 18 km (sleeping elevation: 1500 m) (''VDT Stage 40'')''Open fields on the Via Dinarica Trail''After our restless night in the thunder and lightning storm, we were glad to experience blue skies again.''Guesthouse Zabojsko Jezero''We were surprised to arrive at Guesthouse Zabojsko Jezero, as we hadn’t noticed it on the maps when we had been researching our route. We were planning to camp this night, but since we did not sleep much the night before, and since we were still a bit shell shocked from all the thunder and lightning, we opted for this cute little A-frame instead. For €10/person we not only got to sleep in the little cabin, but we also got another organic, locally sourced and homemade meal. We were on cloud 9!''A Frog Hatch on the Via Dinarica Trail''We not only felt thrilled to be a guesthouse, but we also felt quite lucky to see this tremendous frog hatch! There were tens if not a few hundred thousand newly born teeny-tiny frogs hopping just about anywhere we looked. We had to delicately pick our way back to the guesthouse to avoid squashing any of them.''Day 10: Guesthouse Zabojsko Jezero to''Mojkovac''– 32 km (sleeping elevation: 1000 m) (''VDT Stage 40'')''Big Blue Sky on the Via Dinarica Trail''After we left Guesthouse Zabojsko Jezero, we encountered a lot of wide open fields. We were really glad we had GPS capabilities on this stretch of trail because many of the trail markers were painted on rocks, and many of those rocks were hidden in the tall grass.''This stretch of trail was stunningly beautiful, but it would have been nearly impossible to follow without GPS. We highly recommend you bring GPS when hiking on the VDT. As an aside, can you see our friend hiding in the picture?''A Natural Herder''If you couldn’t see it in the last photo, our canine friend was still following us! In fact, she followed us for 3 days and nearly 50 km (30 miles)! Although she nearly got us charged by a few bulls, we grew to love her and even considered taking her back to Hong Kong with us. When we eventually had to say goodbye to her, it was tear jerkingly tough.''As we reached the final few miles of our journey we realized the Via Dinarica Trail is unrelentingly beautiful.''Unrelentingly''. Although we thought hiking nearly 100 miles of of the VDT would satisfy our desire to explore it, our hike only served to intensify it. We are certainly planning to hike more, if not all, of this spectacular trail, and we highly recommend it to anyone who loves the great outdoors.''If you’re ready for the Via Dinarica Trail to be your newest obsession too, go on and get out there!''About the Author:''Seth and Julia are a happily married American couple living and working in Hong Kong.

They usually won’t contribute a lot to the economy because they’re on a tight budget. Maybe they will interact with locals positively, but aren’t they receiving a lot more knowledge/hospitality than they are giving back? How are they contributing to society?”''If the answer is yes, it is selfish, \xa0I guess a follow up question would be – what’s wrong with being selfish? 😛 It probably depends on the person!”''It was such a good question that it had me thinking of all kinds of arguments and angles because while I believe that yes, it is selfish, I think there’s so much more to it than that. If done right, traveling is actually an incredibly generous act. Let’s deep-dive:''Are we travelers hedonists?''A little R&R is fine!''A hedonist is, by definition, a pleasure-seeker.''I think it’s part of the human experience to be hedonistic now and then. I believe that life is supposed to be fun, like a dance, a concept I learned from Philosopher,''Alan Watts''.''Part of the joy of traveling is following your bliss. I think playing and relaxing is important and that we are taught to repress it too much in the name of productivity and purchasing power.''Taking a break is important. Doing something for yourself is important. We can be better sisters, brothers, mothers, children, friends, and partners when we take all-important time for ourselves.''However there is a delicate line we tread between being a traveler who contributes meaningfully and a raucous backpacker who disrespects locals and their environment. If someone is only traveling for a cheap party, then it seems to me there isn’t much point in leaving home.''It’s a choice – will you be a good guest or a bad tourist?''Are thrifty backpackers failing to contribute at a high enough level?''Does being on a budget mean you’re not helping? No!''Does being on a tight budget mean contributing less to the local economy? Not necessarily.''On the surface it might seem like a cheap backpacker isn’t helping the local economy much by trying to save every dollar and haggling like a pro, but in a lot of ways he/she still does.''I was''super thrifty''during the first couple years of my travels/this blog. I was hunting for a good deal, often spending only $2-5 per night on accommodation, but that also meant that I was more likely to be spending it locally. Most of the basic backpacker accommodation I stayed in during my two years in Southeast Asia was locally-owned, putting money directly into the pockets of small business owners, not Hilton’s.''The same goes for food. Street food goes directly to the smallest business owners, who also shop locally at the markets, buying directly from farmers, and so on. I \xa0see a lot of good in that –''it’s fresh, it’s local'', it’s good for the people and good for the planet.''I’ve also found that I can often go cheaper by talking directly to the source, like a''private hike through the jungle searching for Orangutans for 25€ in Indonesia'', or a boat trip in Mozambique because we talked directly to the person who owned the boat, or buying jewelry directly from the woman who made it on the street in China rather than in a shop.''When you start getting smart on how to save money, it often brings you closer to the small business owners and when spent right, a little money is way better than no money, or money that only gets remitted back to big businesses overseas.''Are we receiving more than we give?''My trusty backpack and I – we’ve been doing this for half a decade.''This one is hard to answer because it’s so subjective. Maybe the guesthouse owner in''Mozambique''is happy to have my $15 for her bungalow, which allows her to employ more local people, though maybe she’d prefer that the beach never saw tourists and remained the same as it was before we arrived.''Each situation will be different. In some cases, tourism bolsters the economy and keeps the place alive,''like in Churchill'', and in some it ruins the tranquil vibe that locals once enjoyed.''All we can do as travelers is approach everything with respect. Respect the people, their environment, their way of life, and their need to earn a living as much as we can without being taken advantage of.''How does long-term travel contribute positively to society?''Yas!''Learning about the world helps you become a better citizen of it, I believe. It’s the best education you can find, because you learn a little something from everyone if you remain open and curious. It’s also a reminder of just how lucky those of us who travel are.''I believe these perspectives lead us closer to ourselves and our desires. It makes us see how small we are in the world and how interconnected too. People generally have a better idea of who they are and what they want after traveling long-term. It’s often a catalyst for growth.''For me, traveling led me to my dream. I became a writer, a published author, a photographer, and learned how to build my own business using the world as my classroom and in many cases, a cheap way of paying rent while I was building.''If more of the people who voted in powerful countries were out living to their true potential, having more fun, and truly appreciating their privilege, I think we’d have more understanding and appreciation for each other. That would not only make time spent with one’s family more enriched and meaningful, but it would help everyone on a grander scale if we were happier as a whole.''As author Marianne Williamson so brilliantly said, “As we let our light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence actually liberates others.”''It took me years after reading that to fully, deeply understand it, and I couldn’t have without traveling.''So no, I don’t think that backpacking is inherently selfish.

I never realized when I uploaded my first photo- a giant fortune cookie my friend Sunny sent for my birthday – to Instagram that a fun hobby would eventually be such a big part of my life and business.''I’ve talked about my gear plenty on here before, but when Googling recently I saw that ‘bemytravelmuse camera’ comes up in the top five search terms for my site, so I guess I haven’t adequately answered the question!''So here it is – everything I use and the methods I employ to capture my photos:''Main Camera: Sony A7 S''Shooting the night sky in Kyrgyzstan''I upgraded from a''Sony a6000''to a''Sony A7 S''in January when I decided that I wanted to shoot more low-light photos and that creating videos would be a big part of my life going forward. I still think that the Sony a6000 is a fantastic travel camera and if you’re not ready to shell out the big bucks for the Sony A7 S, I highly recommend the a6000.''What I love about this upgraded camera is that it’s full-frame, plus it has a microphone jack and it does just what I hoped it would – shoots absolutely gorgeous lowlight photos and video. Check out my''YouTube channel''to see some of the video I’ve been shooting with this new baby!''Zeiss 35-16 mm wide-angle lens''Wide angle lenses let you capture things like this''I use this lens the most''. I love that it catches so much of what I’m looking at due to the wide angle. This lens might seem expensive but as with any hobby, the more you get into it the more you opt for gear that’s better quality which helps you perform better. I get a much crisper image with this lens than I do with the cheaper ones, plus it is a great companion for night photos.''Telephoto Lens''I was able to photograph this gorilla with the lens in Uganda''I still use the''telephoto lens''that came with my Sony a6000 bundle, and while it works, I would like to have a nicer lens than this one sometime soon.''DJI Mavic Pro''The lavender fields in Provence from above''Since so much of my photography is selfies, getting a drone really upped my game. It has also made my videos so much better. It’s not even fair, really, how much easier this makes getting great shots:''Sadly, more and more regulations are coming out that make it harder to fly everywhere, simply because they’re getting more popular and accessible to the masses. That’s okay, I’m willing to go more remote in order to get the shots that nobody has yet, like in Kyrgyzstan.''GoPro and dome''Taken in the Maldives with the dome''I only use my''GoPro''these days for underwater photos and videos since the Sony is so good above water. One toy I really like pairing with it is''the dome''to get those shots that are simultaneously above and below water.''I do think that for those who want great photos without having to know about camera settings, and who want versatility, that the GoPro is a great choice in the absence of a larger camera. However it’s not the best camera for night photography and it’s pretty much useless for wildlife photography.''Tripod''Shot this of myself in Hawaii with a tripod''I alternate between a''gorilla pod''when I’m trekking, since it’s light and I need to reduce the weight whenever possible, to a heavier metal one.''I used to use a plastic''Amazon brand tripod''and while I still think it’s a great choice, I had to switch because in extremely cold temperatures the plastic clasps broke right off. Since I am doing a lot more in the winter and the arctic, I need something metal that can withstand temperatures under -20 degrees C.''iPhone''So much easier than a big camera''While It’s rare that I use an iPhone for photos, I use it all the time for my Instagram stories and I wrote a post about''how to get great iPhone photos''as well for those who aren’t ready to put the cash into photo equipment. With a lens and a little tripod there’s a lot you can do with a phone. It is, however, very limited in low light and not great if you really want to zoom in.''Lightroom''Make those colors pop''I do my editing in''Lightroom''and love how user-friendly it is.

The next day, we were on a glass-bottom snorkeling boat, just the five of us plus Hero and a captain, and we spent the whole day snorkeling and sailing for $20 each. Not bad.''So that’s what we did.''I was in this part of the world three years ago as well, but that time, I visited Gili Trawangan, or ‘Gili T’ for short.''It’s''where my memoir''from my first year of travels comes to an end, where I finished up my first ten months of solo gallivanting around Asia\xa0and where I made a promise to myself that I would keep going. In short, that place holds a very dear spot in my heart and I was dying to go back.''Then I heard it had become a party island and, though it was that before, it sounded like it had become a lot more popular than the more or less sleepy island I had visited so long ago on a little public boat over from Lombok after''climbing Rinjani''.''Sunset on Gili Air''Coincidentally, I was on both islands during Ramadan, so I feared that things might be too quiet or shut down completely on what are otherwise social islands.''During Ramadan, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset. Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam, and Muslims past the age of puberty are required to fast except for the elderly and ill. Muslims also refrain from impure thoughts and behavior and practice self-reflection during this time.''In Indonesia, they observed the fasting but the bars and restaurants remained open for tourists and locals who don’t observe. Though perhaps a bit quieter than they would normally be, both islands were more or less business as usual.''So which should you pick if deciding between Gili Air or Gili Trawangan?''Pin me!''My theory is that Gili Air is today what Gili T was for me three years ago. Things change so quickly in Indonesia that when one spot becomes popular, word spreads quickly and tourism increases rapidly.''If you want to party hard, Gili T could be a better spot. If you want to party and chill, Gili Air might be best, and if all you want to do is chill with no partying at all, check out Gili Meno. Even better, all of these islands, including Lombok, are easy to reach via public ferry within a few minutes and for super cheap (go local rather than tourist transport).''So it seems that you can’t go wrong no matter what you choose.''Have you been to both?

I was just walking down the street, minding my own business, when suddenly – splat! It was my first solo trip and of all the things that could have gone wrong this weekend, cancelled flights/missed buses/hostel robberies etc., this was really the only causality. Maybe solo traveling wasn’t so bad after all.''A little poop ain’t got nothing on me!''I’m Rachel, a current junior at Harvard College, originally from Hong Kong. I grew up in Asia and have always loved to travel. Now that I’m in college, I’ve started to dabble in solo travel as well and I’m loving it so far. This summer, I worked at a women’s rights organization in Buenos Aires. It was an incredible experience and it also allowed me to travel all over Argentina. That’s how I ended up doing my first solo trip to Salta and Jujuy in the north of the country. It truly was an amazing trip but it certainly wasn’t without incident…''I couldn’t help but laugh after the pigeon incident. I cackled like a crazy person and hunched down on the sidewalk until my sides hurt. I was nearing the end of my first solo trip and I wasn’t going to let a little airborne feces get in the way of my female empowerment. Once I finally stopped laughing, I walked over to the nearby fountain in the square, cleaned myself up, and continued to explore the city.''As I walked around Salta la Linda (Salta the Lovely, as the locals call it), I reflected on the past four days of my life. I came to Salta with the following goals: explore the amazing landscape of Northern Argentina, see llamas, eat empanadas salteñas, and do it all solo – just me, myself, and I. Well, I came, I saw, and I ate. I have always been inspired by solo female travelers. And though my trip was short, I think I can now say that I have joined their ranks. Here’s a little bit more about being solo in Salta!''Getting around''Pretty in pink''The city of Salta is the capital of Salta province in northwest Argentina. It is located in the Lerma Valley right at the foothills of the Andes. It is a small but beautiful city full of a unique mix of colonial architecture and Incan influence. Many people use Salta as the jumping off point to explore the stunning landscape of the neighboring province of Jujuy (pronounced “hoo-hoo-ee”). Jujuy is right on the border of Chile and Bolivia and is the llama and cactus capital of Argentina. The beautiful canyons, giant salt flats, and rainbow mountains are absolute must-sees.''I’m currently living in Buenos Aires working a summer internship at an Argentine women’s rights organization. For my penultimate weekend, I decided to fly up to Salta to explore all that the city and Jujuy has to offer. There are daily flights from Buenos Aires to Salta on various airlines. I recommend using despegar.com to find cheap flights. Taking a 17 hour or so bus from Buenos is also an option. Given my limited amount of time, I did a lot of research beforehand and decided that I wanted to see the following things: the Jujuy town of Purmamarca, at the foothills of the Hill of Seven Colors, the Pucará de Tilcara (ancient fortress of Tilcara), the Quebradra de Humahuaca (Humahuaca Canyon), and the Salinas Grandes (the giant salt flats).''I’m a total city girl so I don’t know how to drive, let alone drive stick which is virtually the only sort of rental car available up north. Because of this, I ended up booking bus tours online before getting here. Of course, there are pros and cons to being on a bus tour. If you speak Spanish, the guides are a great way to learn more about the region and you don’t have to worry about navigation whatsoever. On the other hand, they can sometimes feel a bit rushed and you can’t stop whenever you want. That being said, I was really happy with both of the tours that I went on via Viator. However, you definitely don’t have to book beforehand as most hostels offer excursions and as there are hundreds of tour agencies around the Plaza de 9 de Julio (the main square) once you get to Salta. As of writing, prices range from 700-1400 pesos ($40-80 USD) for day-trips so you can definitely find something within your price range.''Purmamarca, one of the little towns amongst the mountains of Jujuy is two to three hours north of Salta. From there, you can also visit the Salinas Grandes. If you keep heading north from there, you’ll hit the towns of Tilcara and Humahuaca. If I were to do this trip again, I would have chosen to stay in Purmamarca or Tilcara for one night instead of returning back to Salta. If I had more time, I also would have tried to hit up the towns of Cachi and Cafayate which are to the south of Salta. Definitely check these out as options if you’re planning on heading up there!''My experience''But enough of the logistics. Here’s a bit more about my experience. My weekend trip was a whirlwind of folclórico (traditional folk music), stunning views, hostel quirks, and kind strangers. It was also one of many intense mental highs and lows.''I have stayed in many hostels before but none quite as cheap as the Sol Huasi which cost me about 160 pesos ($9USD) a night. I remember lying awake in my little bunk bed on my first night feeling super on edge, what with the smelly bathroom right next door and the freezing temperatures. I was part thrilled that I was out here all by myself, but also part terrified that I was out here all by myself. Being surrounded by snoring men also did not help the nerves. Neither did the fact that one of them thought it was totally ok to 1) sleep through an alarm no less than five times at 4:00 frickin’ AM and 2) proceed to turn on the lights at 4:30 AM when he finally decided to wake the fuck up (come on man, that’s just rude). And so, I went into my first full-day of my trip rather sleep-deprived and still a little nervous.''Perhaps a much better roommate choice''Fortunately, the nerves faded as I boarded my bus for a tour of the''Salinas Grandes''. We left Salta at 7:00am and were treated to a beautiful sunrise across the Andes. The views only got more stunning as we drove further into Jujuy. The landscape here is known for incredible cerros (hills) of rich colors produced by years of sedimentation. The dry land is perfect for cactuses of every size which pop up everywhere. We first drove through the''Quebrada del Toro''(Bull Gorge) and along the same route as the famous''Tren a las Nubes''(Train to the Clouds – another option in Jujuy although I’ve heard it’s a tourist trap).''I happened to be on a bus full of mostly old couples. They were all very surprised at the presence of me, a random Chinese girl (I was literally the only Asian I saw my entire trip), and even more surprised that I could speak Spanish. I in turn, was very surprised by how kind they all were to me. As we drove amongst the jagged hills, we kept gaining altitude which was hard on some of the older folk in our group. One of the abuelas offered me hojas de coca, a type of leaf that locals leave in their mouths to deal with altitude sickness – something I was unaware of before leading to a funny “lost in translation” moment.''“¿Qué es esto? (What is this?)” I asked the lady.''I misheard her response and thought she said “Es cocaina para su cabeza” – it’s cocaine for your head. Perdon? Did an old lady just offer me hard drugs on a bus in the middle of the Argentine desert? Seeing my confused look, she then showed me the leaves and explained that they were coca leaves that alleviated headaches. Haha! Luckily, I didn’t need them, even as we climbed to 3000-4000 meters (9,800-13,000 feet) above sea level.''After navigating some rickety roads, we finally arrived at the Salinas Grandes. They took my breath away. They were a giant expanse of white as far as the eyes can see – almost like a field of snow but hard and with textured ridges that crisscrossed the ground in a geometric grid. They pure white contrasted against the beautiful blue sky looked infinite. It was here that I perfected the art of shamelessly asking strangers to take photos of me. Pro-tip, always ask young people who are taking tons of photos with many different poses. Other millennials will know how to capture your perfect shot!''Thank you, stranger, for this (and 10 other) photo!''On the way home, our driver blasted traditional Argentine music and the bus turned into an impromptu geriatric choir as everyone sang along. Now this is a road trip! I returned to Salta at around 8:00 and made some friends at the hostel. We went out for dinner where I had the world’s best sangria which also helped my sleep through the night despite the arrival of more snoring men at the hostel.''The next day, I headed out at 7:00am again to tour the pueblos hidden amongst the canyons of Jujuy. At''Purmamarca'', I marveled at the Cerro de Siete Colores (Hill of Seven Colors), a rainbow hill next to an equally rainbow town filled with artisanal crafts and local vendors. In''Tilcara'', I climbed a pre-Incan fortress that might as well have been a shrine to the mighty cactus. And in''Humahuaca'', I feasted on locro, a classic Northern Argentine stew of corn and beans, and also shopped at the local market.''Not a single cloud in the sky in Tilcara''Again, I was so surprised by the kindness of strangers. One of the women on my bus was traveling with her seven-year-old son. I think her mom instincts kicked in when she saw that I was by myself because she insisted that I use her sun screen to protect my skin. Mothers, even when they’re not your own, really do know best! The brilliant sun shone relentless on all the beautiful canyons that we drove through really highlighting the rusty red hues. In Humahuaca, I ran into some of the people from my tour from the day before. They all greeted me with besos (kisses) and hugs as though I was a long-lost grandchild. It reminded me that sure, I was alone, but I was certainly not lonely. In fact, I also made a bunch of four-legged friends (insert llama photos). I was thoroughly exhausted but also content by the time I got back to the hostel.''it’s so fluffy I’m gonna die!''I spent my last day wandering around Salta by myself. I climbed up the hill of''San Bernado''and tried to convince myself that I was out of breath because of the altitude and not because of the amount of empanadas I had consumed. I also walked around the city’s many squares and plazas just taking it all in. Of course, that’s when the treacherous pigeon decided to take a dump on me.''When I finally got back home to Buenos Aires and told my host-mom about my experience, pigeon poop and all, she laughed.''“¡La gente dice que eso es buena suerte! (People say that that’s good luck!)” she told me. And while I’m not looking to get shit on again any time soon, I can’t disagree with the fact that yeah, I am one lucky girl. Lucky to have experienced the beauty of Northern Argentina, and lucky to be a young solo female traveller.''I am one blessed girl''About The Author:''Rachel is a current Junior at Harvard University studying Women and Gender Studies and Romance Languages.

Seriously, it’s just not possible. Some are well-known and well-loved, while others you’ve never heard of.''But I have to admit, there’s something special about the more untouched locations. I mean, I’ll have a vino in a crowded wine bar any day, but an afternoon in the mountains with nothing but the wind and a kea for company is the best. Keas are native New Zealand mountain parrots, and they are SO NAUGHTY.''Naughty naughty!''A question I’m often asked is what places in New Zealand should we visit outside the main areas? And to be honest, it’s a tough one! Because there are just so many, and frankly, some of them are local secrets where I would be murdered if I blogged about them. Sorry!''But luckily there’s a happy medium. From high glacial lakes to isolated beaches to secluded bubbling springs to geological formations that you can’t quite believe are real, Kiwiland is brimming with the extraordinary and often still untouched.''So, here’s ten of my favourite off-the-beaten-track locations to visit, if you want to escape the world for little while.''Away from it all''Crucible Lake, Mt Aspiring National Park''Okay, I’m not going to lie, the hike up here is an absolute bitch. Located in the Siberia Valley, a remote corner within Mt Aspiring National Park on the west coast side and less visited than its neighbor in west Wanaka, Lake Crucible certainly meets my ‘off the beaten track’ criteria.''The best way to visit Lake Crucible is by the''Siberia Experience'', a local tourism activity (that is still super underrated guys), where you fly into the Siberia hut, drop your overnight bags, then hike up to the lake as a day trip, return and overnight in the hut, then hike a few hours out the next day and get picked up by a jetboat to zoom your way back to Makarora.''Otherwise you can do it all hiking but you’ll have two days of a very long boring walk in and out. Best to do in summer, with lots of icebergs in early summer.''You’ll arrive in a field in a little yellow plane, and spend the next few hours walking in the shadow of Mt Awful and Mt Dreadful wishing you were on a beach, preferably with a cocktail. I think there’s about 10 river crossings, most of which are mellow but freezing. It’s not a hike for beginners – you need river crossing and route finding experience and to be pretty fit. But seriously, all that negativity comes to a screaming halt when you summit that final moraine and this truly outstanding lake comes into view.''I mean, it has icebergs. I can’t even. What more could you want from a humble alpine pond?''Worth the hike!''New Chums Beach, Coromandel''I first came across this beach when I was road-tripping from the North Island down to Wanaka to live on the South Island. It seemed magical then, and it’s still magical now! Part of the Coromandel Peninsula, New Chums is a secluded white stretch of sand that you have to hike to get to.''And like most walks in NZ ‘hike’ is an understatement. This beach is not easy to get to! I spent the entire time trying not to break an ankle as I scrambled over slippery seaweed covered boulders that stank to high heaven.''Luckily, my perseverance paid off and I emerged out onto its pristine, deserted shores. Winning!''So beautiful''Cape Kidnappers Gannet Reserve, Hawkes Bay''This one combines two of my favourite things – birds and rocks (cue, eye roll – yes I’m aware I’m a nerd). Located in the Hawke’s Bay region of New Zealand, most people visit here for the Art Deco scene, or the wine.''Though, you should rethink your priorities though because bird and rocks is where it’s at! Set on 13 hectares of private land including several spectacular geological cliff formations, this Department of Conservation managed colony is the largest mainland gannet population in the world.''Visit via a gentle walking track, or take a safari beach tour-by-tractor. Definitely do the latter. Why walk when you can tractor?''Te Waikoropupū Springs, Golden Bay''Ok, so these springs aren’t''quite''so off-the-beaten-track as the other locations. Golden Bay has always been a classic summer kiwi holiday spot, but hasn’t become part of the more recent tourist boom. But I’m adding it in anyway because the Te Waikoropupū Springs are often overlooked at least by foreign tourists. And, well – they shouldn’t be.''The largest freshwater spring in the Southern Hemisphere, the ‘Pupu Springs’ are also the clearest in the world, bested only by the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Boom! They discharge 14,000 litres of water per second. Thats 40 bathtubs by the way. Per second!''An easy, breezy stroll – you’ll arrive in your childhood dream of a fairytale glen complete with lily pads, frogs and every shade of green there ever was. Ladies, you’re welcome.''But remember you can’t touch the water and you DEFINITELY can’t swim in them (anymore). Sacred to local Māori, the Pupu Springs are considered''taonga''(treasure) and''wāhi tapu'', a place held in high cultural and spiritual regard, so hands off.''Must… Resist… Touching…''Waipara Valley, North Canterbury''This one’s all about the wine which makes it a''real favorite''of mine (ok, an extra special fave, considering this is already a list of favorites). Only an hour north of Christchurch, the Waipara Valley wine region is often bypassed in favour of the more prominent Central Otago, famous for its Pinot Noirs.''And while it’s no secret I love the autumnal hues of my adopted home turf, Waipara is really something special. It produces internationally award-winning Pinot Noir, Riesling and Chardonnay and, guys, it has TRUFFLES. Seriously. You can go truffle foraging!''It’s a magical dry valley with some of the friendliest locals you’ll meet, a great diverse landscape with the sea right nearby, and its own boutique hub of wineries and foodie spots waiting to be discovered.''It’s also home to to a ton of fossils, including the world’s oldest penguin fossil and a 10 km oyster bed. Put this one on your list, pronto!''Too beautiful for words''Curio Bay, The Catlins''Before I moved to Wanaka, I’d never heard of Curio Bay, or''The Catlins'', where its located. Chances are, you won’t have either. And also I’m going to be in trouble for sharing this one, sorry!''One of the country’s best, ‘best kept’ secrets, tucked away at the bottom of the South Island, Curio Bay is wild and desolate, but at the same time full of life. Wildlife that is. Which is just the way I like it! You’ll see a petrified forest, seals, native birds (love me some birds) and if you’re lucky – dolphins and Yellow-Eyed Penguins.''Check out the waterfalls, the local surf school and the historic lighthouses. Oh, and you’ll likely have the place to yourself. Ticks all the boxes.''Beautiful evening hues at Curio Bay''Putangirua Pinnacles, Wellington''The Dimholt Road and the Paths of the Dead (nerd alert!), I mean the Putangirua Pinnacles, are a series of spooky pillar formations in the Wairarapa region just two hours from Wellington.''Most tourists come for the wine, but I say come for the wine with a side of geology. And obvs, I’m a little biased because it was the setting for some major Lord of The Rings scenes. But Despite the Tolkien fanfare, it’s still mostly passed over due to its isolation and the fact you have to hike to get there.''A couple hours drive from Wellington, this corner of the North Island is still very local in feel and very much off the beaten tourist trail.''But unlike Crucible and New Chums, this one is a fairly straightforward 4 hour round trip and not too challenging. So getcha fantasy on people! Middle Earth awaits!''“This is no place for a hobbit!”''Street Art, Dunedin''Ok, so this one’s not technically off the beaten track. Buuuuut it definitely fits the brief for hidden in plain sight.''I mean, I’ve only just heard of it myself!''Situated in and around the central city is the most incredible Street Art trail. Like, incredible.''Dunedin has always been sort of a grungy, university art town in the South Island, but recently it’s really been up and coming with a growing foodie scene, some of the best coffee in New Zealand, and the most kickass street art scene around.''With some of the most prominent street artists in the world commissioned including Belgium’s ROA, this epic cultural trail takes Dunedin to a whole other level.''I did a tour with Victoria of Street Kiwi, and you should probs do the same. You’ll get all the back-stories and see all the artwork – including pieces you just wouldn’t find alone. It’s a win/win I say.''With one of my favorite pieces''Jackson Bay, West Coast''When I say Jackson Bay is remote, I mean it’s end-of-the-line remote. I think there’s like less than 30 people that actually live here. Which is why it’s awesome, obviously!''On the West Coast of the South Island just past Haast, Jackson Bay is surrounded by rainforest, and is one of only places in New Zealand regularly used as a wild nursery for the rare Hector’s dolphin. Because you have to drive well off the main highway to get here, it’s often overlooked by road-trippers.

In 1915, he created the first-ever Singapore Sling, which was a gin-based concoction of D.O.M. Bénédictine, cherry brandy, Cointreau, pineapple juice, lime juice and angostura bitters.

Which is a shame, because Myanmar is one of the most culturally preserved and exciting destinations in Asia.''Why isn’t Myanmar on everyone’s “must do” lists?''It honestly wasn’t on my list until I was invited by a friend. Before traveling to Myanmar, I didn’t know anything about the country except about how it was closed off from the world up until about a couple decades ago.''After backpacking through a large portion of Myanmar during their annual Thingyan Festival, I can without a doubt declare Myanmar as''my favorite country in Southeast Asia''.''Myanmar is captivating and exciting country for many reasons. From floating villages, to valleys of ancient temples that beat out Angkor Wat, to multi-day jungle treks into mountain tea picking villages.''Ready to go yet? Awesome. Here’s my itinerary\xa0on the best of Myanmar, from\xa0where to go and what to do from my own personal experiences, and a few key tips and tricks to know before you go.''Yangon''Yangon (''former capital city of''Rangoon'') is the highest populated city in Myanmar, and most likely where you will arrive. It’s the country’s bustling economic capital filled with colonial-era buildings mashed up against the modern high-rises and buddhist temples.''The first thing you’ll notice is that there aren’t constant horns, and no motorbikes in the city. That’s because they aren’t allowed in downtown Yangon. Ahhh, peace and quiet! TO some extent.''On arrival, it can be just as overwhelming as a place like Bangkok or Jakarta, but take a deep breath, settle into a hostel, and go for a wander. Here in Yangon you’ll get to experience everyday life of Myanmar people who are usually too busy to try and surround you to sell goods, but are happy to flash a smile. Explore the old and new of a fast growing city, and Yangon will have endless opportunity for street photographers.''Stay:''This hostel''is well maintained, clean, and provides unique breakfast every morning.''Chinatown''Most of the accommodation will be centered around the market streets and Chinatown area, and this is a great place to eat for your first night as you take everything in. 19th and 20th streets are the hotspots, and though it can be crowded and a bit funky smelling, there are plenty of restaurants to have a big meal, large cold beer, and ample people watching.''Shwedagon Pagoda (Golden Pagoda)''Personally, I’m a bit “''templed out''”''in southeast Asia, but this one is worth a visit.''Shwedagon Pagoda''is the most sacred temple in all of Myanmar, and a popular pilgrimage for Buddhists. Legend has it that this golden pagoda and complex was built more than 2,500 years ago, making it the oldest Buddhist temple in the world.''Colonial Markets''I love walking through markets, you can get a real sense of life in the countries there. Especially when nobody bothers you! These sprawling ornate ironwork markets date back to British rule almost 100 years ago and will be a good escape from the heat and best place to buy clothes, bags, and other trinkets if you need anything. Bonus, the vendors don’t chase you down like many other markets.''Quick Tips:''Eat eat eat! Yangon will have the most diverse selection of food in Myanmar.''Book accommodation ahead of arrival'', hostels and hotels fill up fast, especially during holidays. Yangon will be the best place to get toiletries and supplies so stock up. Get a sim card here (they are easy to find, and the airport has reasonable prices.)''Kyaiktiyo Pagoda and Golden Rock''East of Yangon is one of the top three most important Buddhist pilgrimage sites in Myanmar.''Kyaiktiyo Pagoda''is a massive golden rock barley balancing on the edge of an 1,100 meter tall mountain with breathtaking panoramic views of the jungle valley (''and a heart-pounding ride to the top''). To get to the pagoda, you’ll need to take a bus to Kinpun village and head up early morning packed into the back of a truck with monks and Myanmar people.''If you feel up for the challenge, you can hike the entire way to the top from the village which will be a 5+ hour trek through jungle and mountainous terrain, but it’ll be the ultimate way to experience the pilgrimage. Once at the top, buy a golden leaf and stick it onto the boulder (only men are allowed to do that)…just don’t be the one who finally pushes it over the edge!''Stay:''This hotel''is 30 minutes away from the Kyaiktiyo Pagoda. There are also a few hotels located at the foot of the Pagoda that are a lot more expensive.''Inle Lake''Inle was one of the most beautiful town I visited in Myanmar, which is hard to choose because many are. But, let’s just say, it was the most lush. About 9-10 hours north by bus is Inle Lake, a sprawling and beautiful natural contrast to Yangon tucked into a valley surrounded by green hills is a network of canals, irrigation waterways, farms, and a giant fresh water lake. It’s a perfect escape after experiencing the bustling city life of Yangon.''Boat ride through the Floating Village''Once in Inle Lake, the most known attraction is the floating villages. It is essentially a neighborhood on stilts, where locals live in huts built above a network of marsh and grass waterways. Take a boat and see what life is like living on the water and relying off of food farmed in the grassland or fished. The scenery itself is beautiful, and it’s relaxing sitting in the canoe cruising through the maze of houses watching children climb from one house to the next to wave you along.''Trekking to Inle Lake''If you’re trekking and outdoor inclined like myself,''hit Kalaw first and do the 3-day trek to Inle Lake''that takes you through valleys and small villages where you’ll stay each night, experiencing rural Myanmar life. The cost cheap, the views are spectacular, and the trek is life-changing. No hot showers, no electricity, not internet, just pure experiences with the nicest people on earth.''Quick Tips:''Inle Lake is one of the more popular destinations so it’s good to book accommodation ahead. Just outside of the town limits, there is a vineyard and winery that’s worth a visit after a bicycle ride around the country roads.''Stay:''Ostello Bello''is the most popular hostel in that area, and it is awesome for solo travelers who want to meet others.''Hotel Brilliant''offers more privacy – make sure to check out the restaurant right opposite the hotel!''Bagan''Bagan was one of my favorite experiences during my time exploring the county. Whether you hit Bagan before or after Inle Lake, it is still a must see when visiting Myanmar. Considered the Angkor Wat of Myanmar (''but I think it’s better''), Bagan is a UNESCO Heritage site and valley of more than 2,000+ ancient temples built during a golden era of Burma in the 12th century. During the summer months while I was there, the valley is arid and covered in rust-colored red sand, but in the monsoon season becomes a vibrant green jungle climate.''Temple Raiding''At times, we were surrounded by hundreds at the largest temples, and at other times, completely alone to crouch and crawl through narrow passages of empty temples. Rent a scooter and cruise around to some of the 2000+ temples around Bagan, but there’s no way you’ll see them all. Get adventurous and go down some of the dirt roads to the smaller temples where you’ll find yourself alone to explore, living out your Indiana Jones or Lara Croft fantasies. Scooters can be rented for $5-$10 a day and will make it much easier than bicycles to explore.''Quick Tips:''Bring U.S. dollars for the entrance fee, it ends up being cheaper. Rent a motorbike to explore the temples, it’s the fastest way to see them. Wear sunscreen, hat, and sunglasses. Also, bring something to cover yourself if you want to enter the temples.''Hot air balloons over Bagan''Though we never got to ride the hot air balloons because they stop it during the summer months, everyone tells me it’s an awesome way to experience Bagan. Just before sunset you can take a ride up in a hot air balloon and see the entire valley change from gold to purple with ancient temples as far as the eye can see silhouetted against the horizon.''Stay:''Everyone in Bagan seems to be staying at''Ostello Bello''.''Mandalay''We were in Mandalay during the Thingyan celebrations, so my experience of the city my differ from many others. In central Myanmar, Mandalay is the second largest city in the country, and a good place to launch from for almost all activities and destinations. From Mandalay, you’ll be able to reach Inle Lake, Bagan, and Hsipaw in the far north, which might make it a better choice to base yourself out of. Being another large metropolis of the country, Mandalay will have plenty of delicious places to eat and a decent nightlife scene, with a couple swanky bars overlooking the river.''U Bein Bridge''I’m sure you’ve seen the photos of silhouetted monks walking across a long bridge with a fiery orange sunrise. That my friends it U Bein bridge. By far''one of the best sunrises I’ve ever experienced''(''and I think it will be for you as well''), U Bein Bridge is the world’s oldest and longest teak wood bridge. I would have stayed there all day, but by 9am, it was swarmed with people, so make sure to arrive early! Just before sunrise, the monks follow the call to prayer and all walk across in their crimson robes to the temple across the river.''Mandalay Hill and Mandalay Fort''Get ready to break a sweat. I was panting by the time we reach the top but it’s worth the long walk up to Mandalay Hill to the temple perched at the top for an incredible view at sunset (''and one helluva stair climb''). In the city center, Mandalay Fort is worth checking out surrounded by a large moat.''Stay:''Ostello Bello''(more social) or''Downtown Mandalay''(more local).''Hsipaw''Oh Hsipaw, how I miss those days. Mountains all around, trees that grow out of temples, lush farmland, waterfalls, and the best tea you’ll ever have — sound good? Hsipaw is the main township of the Shan State, located 200km northeast of Mandalay and perfect for anyone needing an escape into the outdoors.This will be the main destination for anyone wanting to do some serious multi-day trekking and to explore more untouched Myanmar in remote mountain villages.''We rented bicycles while in Hsipaw and explored for a couple of days. Though it can become quite hilly and rugged outside of town, every road you go down will have something fascinating to see. Don’t miss the ancient temple complex and check out the stupa that has a tree growing out of it. Watch young monks play games, wander the vibrant fruit and vegetable markets, and relax by the river.''Goteik Viaduct and Train to Hsipaw''For someone who is obsessed with train travel, I had to do what is said to be one of the greatest train journeys in the world. This, above most else, should be on your list of must-do’s in Myanmar. Along the 12 hour journey, you’ll also cross the Goteik Viaduct, considered a world masterpiece in engineering and at one time the world’s longest viaduct bridge at 2,260 ft long.''The old train to Hsipaw is a clunking and captivating journey that leaves Mandalay before dawn and takes you up mountains by zig-zagging it’s way forward and backwards, then down into lush valleys of rice and soy fields. Over 100 years old, it’s a technological marvel of it’s time period and the coolest mode of transport to get to Hsipaw.''Quick Tips:''Purchase tickets at the train station days before, and try to get first class seats for 2,000 Kyats ($2.00). We could only get second class seats and 12 hours on wooden benches is doable but brutal''Hiking to Mountain Tea Villages''Hiking in the countryside was one of the best excursions we did in Myanmar. On the 2-3 day trek you’ll meet rural farmers, tea pickers, and even rebel soldiers who are happy that you are experiencing their small world and sharing their every day life. Don’t worry, even the soldiers were nicest people I’ve ever met. Plus, the tea leaves there are said to help with longevity in life, so drink away!''We stayed in a small traditional hut and ate home cooked meals with a local family, and I drank some rice wine with soldiers (''shhhh''). Our guide, Ax Sai, was extremely knowledgable and spoke English very well, and even took us to some secret waterfalls after a scorching day of trekking.''Quick Tips:''Wear a hat, sunscreen, and bring extra bottles of water and snacks. And proper shoes! Pack things like peanuts or apples that won’t go bad in the heat. Look for Ax Sai, he’s awesome.''BONUS: Thingyan Festival''Thingyan Festival, or the New Year celebration for Myanmar, will most likely be one of the craziest experiences of your life. Thingyan is Myanmar’s biggest holiday and a Buddhist celebration for the purpose of washing the previous year’s sins away and beginning the new year with a clean spirit. With millions of gallons of water.''From''my experience at Thingyan'', it lasted the full week and there was no escaping the chaos. It’s fun, but it’s also exhausting, and after a few days you’ll probably lock yourself inside. Luckily I had goggles after taking on the Rickshaw Run in India to protect me front he blasts to the face.''Quick Tips:''Book accommodation and transport WAY in advance, everything sells out. Get a water proof bag for money and phones. Don’t carry your DSLR, it’ll get destroyed. Remember, it’s their holiday and there is no escaping it, so have fun and don’t get mad. Bring goggles, they are a life saver (especially from eye-infections). And buy the biggest damn water blaster you can find!''Arrival & Getting Around''Before Myanmar relaxed it’s tourism policies, getting visas for the country, let alone most everything else, could be a huge hassle. Sim cards used to be thousands of dollars, banks were scarce, and much more of the country was closed off to travel. Luckily it’s become much easier now to travel to. I found it actually easier than a lot of other countries I’ve visited.''E-Visa:''For your Myanmar visa there are two options. If you want to get everything squared away before arriving, you can apply for the e-visa (''https://evisa.moip.gov.mm/'') which takes a couple of days to process, and after approval, you receive a government issued letter to print and show on arrival. When you arrive, there is a separate line for foreign travelers to walk through and present their passport and letter of approval — no sweat huh?''Visa on Arrival:''If you don’t have time to apply before you arrive, or just feeling a little lazy, you can get a visa on arrival. When I traveled to Myanmar, there was only one person in that line, but it could be a long wait as tourism grows.''Buses:''This was how we mainly traveled through Myanmar. There are fancy VIP buses that are cheap and much comfier than I’ve had in''Thailand'', with reclining seats, blankets, and snacks offered. Now that there is a main highway that runs from Yangon all the way to Mandalay, the road north isn’t too dicey.''Train:''I only got to ride the train in Myanmar once, but it was my favorite way to travel. Train travel is another good option and can be taken from Yangon all the way north to Hsipaw with transfers. My recommendation from experience is to book a 1st class ticket on the train which won’t be much more expensive, and it’ll save your back and bum from a lot of pain. I know from experience.''Private Taxi:''During our time in Myanmar, we mainly took buses when we could find them, but occasionally had to hire a private taxi to drive us to the next destination because nothing else was available. These drivers have nice cars with air-conditioning, but can be quite the speed demons even on roads with sheer cliffs dropping off the side. Our driver had to stop to hose off the breaks because they were smoking.

Here’s Kortney to talk modesty requirements:''Kortney in Stone Town, Zanzibar''We travel girls are easily one of the most independent breeds of women in the universe and rules and molds are only designed to be broken — however, respecting the cultural norms of a country is not only necessary for every respectful traveler, it’s sometimes important for your own safety.''When traveling, bring respect with you wherever you go. Remember you are a guest and experience the destination to the fullest by adopting everything about the culture – even if that means dressing in a way you don’t agree with for a few days.''Here are four tips for keeping modesty in mind:''Research the country before you go – Dive into what information already exists about the country you’re going to. When visiting a particularly religious country, it’s important to observe their traditions especially when entering or exploring around a place of worship. Other countries, those traditions go beyond a place of worship, so it’s best to know your facts and be prepared. Simply Google the country name plus ‘modesty considerations’ and you’ll get some sources specific to your destination. In Turkey, for example, it’s required that women wear a head scarf when walking around a mosque. In Italy, you need to cover knees and shoulders when entering a church. In the Maldives and other majority Muslim countries, women must be fully dressed on a public beach. There are dozens of guidelines and rules to each destination, so be sure to do your research.''Always carry an oversized scarf with you in your bag; this is an easy way to make sure you can always switch to a more conservative look if you find yourself in an area where you could be offending locals.''Always pack a more conservative outfit choice – When traveling around the world, be sure you have at least one go-to outfit that leans toward the conservative side that you can rely on in unexpected situations where modesty is more appropriate.''Use Common Sense – While wearing Lululemon sports bras and our beach bikinis in public may be a cultural norm in the United States non-offensive, one must remember that even in westernized European countries this is still not a norm. Be respectful of the places you visit, dress with some degree of modesty and save more minimal outfits for beloved beach destinations and escapes.''Toiletries''So what do you need to bring with you and what can you refill on the road when you travel? The good news is, with the exception of super remote areas, you can usually at least find Pantene, deodorant, and sunscreen on the road. I still like to come from home with everything I need for at least the first week.

I suggest heading to Amazon or Target and grabbing a few shampoo bottles and filling it up with these three miracle products before embarking on your journey – they go the mile in emergencies and could be the difference between the perfect trip and a disastrous one.''Coconut Oil''– It’s an “all over” body moisturizer, split end remedy, hair mask, lip balm, eye cream and if you have foot blisters from walking, a quick layer of coconut oil will help it heal faster.''Apple Cider Vinegar''– Great to use when your hair needs extra shine and a great skin exfoliator when your dull skin needs to return to regular vibrancy. Also, this is great to sanitize your toothbrush with so it stays on top of its hygiene game – a necessary travel must.''Tea Tree Oil''– When you have a breakout, add a dab of this to the problem area the night before and blemish be gone. Also gross but good to know: if you ever pick up a foot fungus in a hostel or hotel shower (a complete possibility), this will be your best friend as it is loaded with anti-fungal properties.''Baking Soda''– Pack a zip-locked plastic bag with a few tablespoons of baking soda. Mix with your toothpaste to keep teeth super white (even when you’re home, you’ll never go to a dentist for bleaching again).''Low Maintenance Hair Tips''Kortney’s the expert on this one!''Hair is the silent sufferer when it comes to long-term travel. From jumping off the notoriously dry environment of airplanes to being thrashed by wind to saltwater dips in the sea and constantly sleeping on different surfaces – your hair suffers, and the influx of dead ends post-trip will show you that.''Before embarking on a trip around the world, your first order of hair business should be to go to a cut and color that will grow with you over the next several months. You want to remain photogenic for capturing all those breathtaking moments abroad, so be sure you pick a cut that doesn’t require maintenance.''Follow these hair mantras while abroad and it will save your locks damage:''Always put your hair into a braid before sleeping and while in airplanes (otherwise it acts as a net for germs)''Pack a silk pillowcase – these do wonders for maintaining hair shine and minimizing tangles (and stressful brush sessions) in the morning''Apply coconut oil to your ends before sleeping''Wash only once per week and use dry shampoo in meantime''When washing, condition twice with special attention on ends''Let your hair dry naturally and never sleep with wet hair''Use shampoo and conditioner free of Sulfates''Do a''low-maintenance hair mask''when you can''Be sure to book a hair appointment for when you get back home (at least for a trim), but the tips above should keep your locks in glam status as you trek around the world.''Other Essentials –''Backpacks, theft proof gear, and purses''So what do you put all of this lovely stuff in? What else do you absolutely need to bring in order to make your packing list complete? Kortney and I are splitting this section with our respective ideas of what is almost always a good idea to bring along.''I rotate between the following 3 backpacks, and have for about 3 years now:''REI Vagabond 40 L (no longer available, here’s''a great alternative''): Somehow this bag has lasted for five years, and it’s my most-loved and used one of all. It’s very simple with just one main front-load compartment. Nothing on it has broken. It barely even shows wear and tear.''PacSafe 55L Venturesafe: Pacsafe has a new line coming out at the moment so this backpack isn’t currently available, but I just like that it has locking zippers. It’s my Europe backpack since there are so many pickpockets and cobblestone streets (no thanks to wheels!).''REI Venus 70L: This is my trekking backpack. I also use it if I’m in extreme climates on the opposite end of the spectrum and am having a tough time keeping my load light. I’m sad to report I can’t find it on REI’s website and''this is the highest rated alternative''I could find.''Shoulder bag-wise, I alternate between a larger''MetroSafe''bag and a smaller red''Slingsafe''both from Pacsafe. Both are crossbody bags with locking zippers.''For my electronics, I love''this sturdy bag''in transit since it holds my computer and my camera equipment, and I love taking''this camera bag''on hikes. It’s like, fits to my body snugly, and it also has locking zippers.''It’s also good to have a headlamp in case power goes out or you’re sharing a room or camping, a pack towel in case you need to have your own, and I like to buy local SIM cards and put them into my unlocked phone so that I always have a GPS handy.''Finally, the two most important things I have are my''packing cube''and my''wire mesh bag protector''. I use them both constantly. The packing cube allows me to bring way more stuff than I otherwise could since it compresses my clothing. It’s amazing that after 5 years it still hasn’t broken considering the abuse I put it though. Best $2o purchase ever!''The bag protector has served as my stuff’s loyal protector for 5 years when there weren’t lockers or safes. I know it seems like this won’t ever happen but actually this happens all the time if you head off the beaten path.''Kortney adds:''There are several items that go the mile and are versatile enough to pull off for multiple occasions and travel situations:''A light oversized scarf – Whether bundling up on airplanes, covering up your shoulders in order to enter churches in Italy or keeping you warm during unexpected cold fronts, an oversized scarf from a lightweight material (think cotton) goes a long way. Avoid patterns and stick to a color you love that can be paired with all your outfits.''Here are a few clever ways''to style them.''The versatile chic sneaker''– You’ll want walking shoes that can handle hills without making you appear as the obsequious tourist. I’m a fan of converse or an all-white pair of Adidas. If you can’t commit to keeping white clean, both nude and blush sneakers are available to keep looks neutral, chic and functional all at the same time.''One-piece bathing suits – I always pack a couple one-piece bathing suits when going on a long-haul trip because they also pair well with skirts, jeans and shorts (and beach time, of course).''Silky or''lightweight patterned pajama bottoms''– Perfect for both PJs and pulling off during daytime, patterned silky pajamas (Target, anyone?) are comfortable and functional whether turning in or going on a day of casual adventures''Oversized Fedora for less than $9''– Perfect for city adventures, beach time and hiding jet lag when all else fails, every world traveler needs a designated adventure hat. Try to pick a material that is light enough for warm climates but also can be pulled off in colder environments.''Packing light''I traveled for an entire year with just a carry on bag in Southeast Asia. I did it again in Africa the following year, and again that following summer in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. If I can possibly carry my stuff on and not check a bag, that’s what I do. I save time, money, headache over lost bags, and my back. It’s a win-win.''I made a video detailing how I do that here:''Think it can’t work for the winter? Think again!

It’s the cheapest way to stay connected and can be a life saver if you’re lost or stranded.''Which insurance should you bring?''The best case scenario is that you won’t ever need it, but if you do need it and you don’t have it, you could be screwed.''It’s taking a gamble to travel without insurance. In many developing countries, you can pay out of pocket for minor things and it won’t cost you much, but the same places might''hold you hostage''if something major happens and you can’t pay your hospital bills.''It’s not that expensive to get travel insurance, and it can cover you if you need to be evacuated, something big happens, or if you need a family member to be flown to your side. I have used''World Nomads''for the past five years because I like that their explorer plan covers the activities that I love, like hiking, skiing, SCUBA diving, and a lot more.''There you have just about everything you need to know about packing. It’s been over five years now that I’ve been roaming and it’s taken me to every continent (save for Antarctica) and to climates I never imagined were livable.

The paintings were completed in June of this year, leaving behind stunning murals on old buildings and giving us another reason beyond''belugas, polar bears'', and northern lights, to explore Churchill.''The project had its challenges.''The artists''had to be creative getting to Churchill due to the rail closure caused by a major flood this spring. Given there are no roads and the shipping port receives very few boats, overland transportation had to be replaced by flights, and the artists could not bring as many supplies with them as they would normally have at their disposal.''The closure of the rail has heavily impacted the locals as well, who are receiving far fewer supplies, fuel, and food than in previous years. Many also lost their jobs, and given the rail company has no plans of rebuilding, the town is suffering and feeling forgotten, left with an uncertain future.''The local residents donated whatever they could, and many were depicted in the murals as well, which feature animals, people, and the northern lights.''These are the individual messages of each of the murals:''A Small Northern Town and our Common Crisis Emergency Transmission''by Pat Perry''In the artist’s words, “What I see happening in Churchill, Manitoba is frighteningly similar to what was happening in Michigan in the 1970s, 1980s, and through the present. You had the livelihoods of millions of people in Michigan tethered on life support to one industry. When that industry fled and shut down, the rest of the economy followed slowly, like a body’s delayed reaction before it realizes that the head is gone. Instead of millions of people like in Michigan, this time in Churchill there are less people, less companies, and less variables; hundreds of people, a single port that’s now closed, and a single rail line, now washed out.”''You can read the full artist statement on this mural''here''.''The story behind this plane wreck is interesting too: This Commando cargo aircraft was named Miss Piggy due to the size of the loads she carried. On 13 November 1979, a drop in oil pressure caused the overloaded aircraft to perform a forced landing ¼ mile short of the runway. Three crewmen were injured but all survived. Today, Miss Piggy has turned into an official tourist attraction for Churchill.\xa0This was one of my favorite murals, since you can explore the inside as well as admiring the artwork –''more in this vlog''.''Power of Nature''by Arlin Graff''The polar bear on this mural was reconstructed by the artist using pieces and fragments, which represent an attempt to fix what humans have destroyed in nature. “Painting them in large scale is a friendly way of asking for respect, and making people feel small when faced with the grandeur of nature.”''The Last Winter''by Dulk''Dulk’s is one of the more sinister murals, showing the decay and death of the polar bears. In his words: “As a family of polar bears and begulas make their last winter journey on earth, the cub held on to its treasured iceberg, which illustrated the threat of polar bears survival due to the increased melting of the Arctic.”''Peace + Circumstanc''e by Kal Barteski''The artist cleverly used the building’s architecture to portray a larger-than-life, peacefully sleeping polar bear. “The location of this bear, on the polar bear holding facility, highlights the intensity and necessity of wildlife management along polar bear migration paths where polar bears, the largest predators in the world, continue to adapt to the shameful realities of our consumer-driven culture.”''Of the Sea Walls festival which she organized in Churchill, she told me, “For me, the festival was exceptionally meaningful. It was important to me to show the Town of Churchill a glimpse of my gratitude. I’ve been welcomed into their community since I started visiting in 2011 and I’ve found powerful inspiration and purpose in my experiences with polar bears (and polar bear people). It was important to me to give thanks and give back. Initially, my hope was that the festival would leave the community with an opportunity to create a mural tour and generate another source of tourism income, but what we experienced while we were painting was a beautiful shift of the morale. It has been a devastating period for the small town that relies on the rail for so much of their daily life – having the artists and the energy from the festival made a remarkable change in their outlook – and ours. I am excited to see if the murals have a long-term effect. I hope to get back there to add to the collection and help the community in any way I can.”''Encounters at the End of the World''by Kelsey Eliasson''According to the artist'', the bears “stand as a record of Churchill as it is today, they are based on real bears that I have met over the years… As the two first bears weather and likely disappear, the ever-present beluga whales will emerge to take their place as the focal point of the piece. The third bear will also remain, as a somewhat mysterious and judgmental figure.”''Human Nature''by Askew''The phrase, “Human Nature”, according to the artist, signifies a universal excuse to justify everything we are doing wrong in this world. “Churchill is a town where this is the underlying drama at all times. It’s a town so dependent on the natural environment and its wildlife and is simultaneously threatened by it too. Everything in Churchill has a duality, a total double edge to it. The text on the mural illustrates this tension and also draws from the parallels in texture of both the natural and industrial environments of the town.''Footprint''by Mandy van Leeuwen''“Celebrating the resilience of the north throughout the passage of time, a place man and nature meet, where humans choose to walk together or face a great divide. As they navigate the unknown climate, government & corporate challenges that will shape their future.”''Beautiful.''Impact''by Kai Kaulukukui and Crackedink''These two murals aim to send a message to fishermen to consider their waste and disposal of fishing debris.''Know I’m Here''by Georgia Hill''The in-your-face mural with the phrase, “Know I’m Here,” “creates a strong message of valuing the people of Churchill, but also communicating to all people that we need to read the water and world around us in order to know our place and take actions to nurture what we have been given.”''We Swim in the Same Waters''by Charlie Johnston''This mural has a dual purpose, both in memoriam of a young girl who drowned off the coast of Churchill, and the following statement from the artist: “Spirit in the water, spirit in the sky, spirit on the earth, all are connected. My piece is about ancestral legacy, what was passed on to us and what we will leave for our children’s children. She may be the Creator or Sedna the Inuit goddess of the sea. She may be Jessie Tootoo, a healer or grandmother.''Whoever she is, from her open hands the Aurora is unleashed, the ethereal cosmic voice of the ancestors speaking to us. The beluga swims through the aurora, a spirit guide legacy reminding us of what is truly valuable and worthy.”''Mile5''by Jason Botkin''This was one of my favorite murals. It reminded me so much of''Teufelsberg''in Berlin, though this is a tribute to the first nations people, the Dené, who like so many natives, were forced off their land. For more on the history,''read on here''.''Untitled''by Li-Hill''In the artist’s words: “On my last day in Churchill this gorgeous wall called me. I managed to put this image up that has haunted me for years now. Calling out amid extinction, the silent roar dissolving into the fog of memory.”''Hopeful Waiting''by Pat Lazo''This mural speaks to the struggle of the bears and the local residents in Churchill. The artist painted a polar bear sitting and waiting for the return of the ice, “ just as the people of Churchill await the repair of the recently damaged rail line; a vital link to their livelihood and access to essentials.”''The Rope''by Case Maclaim''This painting focuses on the railway closure issue by displaying port workers struggling as tightrope dancers on the railway. “It stands as a metaphor for how fragile life can be in subarctic terrain and how essential the railway and our oceans are for the survival of the people.”''On the Brink''by Li Hill''According to Li, “For my piece I have depicted two scenes, a local conservation officer from the town and a flurry of Polar bears, Arctic sleigh dogs and or wolves. Poised to shoot cracker shells, the main tool to scare off bears, the uniform and stance of the officer allude to times of hunting and stand for human aggression |…| In the context of the town and specifically the recycling center where this mural was painted, the interaction between bears and conservation officers are extremely common and the reading of this piece becomes more specific.''In the broader context and more central to theme is the fact the image radiates outward from a division line. Instead of man vs nature here, it is two sides of the same coin. Both humans and endangered species are in a state of fight or flight. A heightened sense of emergency due to climate change and the long list of global issues place everything in a precarious position. In a town such as Churchill the tensions are local but the story is global.”''Pump''by \xa0Takashi Iwasaki''This lone building is located across from “Know I’m Here” and for a brief period each summer, is framed by this beautiful purple flower, fire weed.''According to the artist, “my artwork addresses the circulation of water in the world in connection to the Pump House on which my mural is painted. The water travels from the Pump House to the faucet, to the people, back to the ocean, plants, and back to the Pump House again. We are all connected and depend on the health of our water supplies and sources to survive. Simply put, water is life.”''The Final Destination''by Stormy Angeconeb''This mural is a tribute to the many seabirds in and around Churchill.''The murals are located in various spots all along the Hudson Bay. In a few hours, it’s possible to drive around and visit all of them''(here’s a map)'', all while enjoying the landscape and scouting polar bears as well.''My thoughts are with the town of Churchill, and especially the polar bears and belugas who made an appearance during my time there in July. Climate change is a subject I’m passionate about and I hope that the story of these murals and the message they intend to send reaches more people in Canada and beyond.''Because, at least for now, Planet Earth is the only home we have.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''I Became a Mural Artist in Vientiane, Laos''10 Quirky Things to Love About Laos''15 Quirky Things to Love About Cambodia''I felt the kayak rocking beneath me and glanced down. A playful, grinning white face looked back up at me, her head cocked to the side as only Belugas (and Narwhals) can do. We checked each other out, she whistling and me squealing in delight, equally curious about the other creature we were seeing.''Oh, hi!''I went to Churchill in the far north of''Manitoba in Canada''with the express purpose of seeing Beluga whales. Each summer between June and August, 60,000 of them swim into the brackish water of the Hudson Bay where the temperature is slightly warmer and more hospitable for their calfs.''They reminded me of the bottlenose dolphins I grew up seeing off the coast of California, playful, curious, and not the least bit shy. I always felt a kindred tie to them, being as much of a fish myself as a person can be.''In Churchill there are several ways to interact with them, both dry and wet. First, we took a zodiac boat out and watching as they get closer and closer, swimming under and around the boat. Here’s the vlog:''Things got even more exciting when we climbed into kayaks that afternoon, paddling in the calm bay while slowly but surely, they came over and started bubbling up around us and even getting close enough to bump my boat. I kept giggling and squealing (which you already know if you watched in my''Instagram story''from the day).''They got so close!''We also snorkeled with them, donning dry suits and floating in the frigid water. I know it was cold but, to be honest, I hardly even noticed because I was so engaged with what I was seeing below, listening to the whistles of the belugas and almost crying with delight while they floated under me, looking up and smiling.''The belugas from up above''Few animal activities have allowed me to get this close to the wildlife. There was the standout experience of seeing a''Manta ray glide right over my head in Komodo'', Indonesia, and the magic of standing just a few feet away from''Gorillas in Uganda'', and now this rounds out my top three wildlife experiences.''The zodiac boat''That’s not even all there is up in Churchill, though. It’s a triple threat, with possible polar bear and northern lights sightings as well.''SO CUTE (and deadly)''I visited with''Lazy Bear Expeditions'', which also took us out on a boat up north to see if we could find some bears as well. Though they’re much more common in the autumn months, unfortunately the belugas are already gone by then, and they were my main draw. By heading up in late July, I got to have both.''A mother and baby beluga (you know the song!)''As far as I know, Lazy Bear is the only outfit in town with a boat of this size that takes you out to see the bears in the summer. Otherwise, in the fall, it’s all about the arctic crawlers in the tundra, so this is a unique experience.''We got pretty close''I was able to snap this''This too''The trip also includes other extras, like exploration around town to this downed aircraft.''You can climb in and around it, which I absolutely loved, as did the kids on the trip.''SO RAD''You can also kindly ask for a wake up call if the aurora activity is high enough and the skies are clear. Since Churchill has the possibility of seeing the northern lights 330 days of the year, you just might see them, even in the summer.''Sadly due to a combo of low activity and clouds I didn’t see them this time but that’s okay, I did in''Iceland''and''Finland''and I will again one day, I’m sure of that.''Some caribou on the shore''Before visiting Manitoba I had no idea how many cool things there are to see there. I was shocked that so few of my travel blogging peers had made it up to Churchill, considering how incredibly cool it is to see Belugas, and how close I was able to get to them.''Manitoba is so underrated. Go for the animals, and''stay for the provincial parks''and 100,000 lakes.''Do it yourself:''Getting there:''After a flood wiped out a section of tracks this year, now the only way to get up to Churchill is to fly. Lazy Bear offers a chartered flight as part of their package.''Costs:''The base rate for the trips with Lazy Bear start at $4,000 CAD (roughly $3100 USD at the time of this writing), which includes the flight, accommodation, most meals, and most activities with a few add-ons.''For solo travelers:''This isn’t a trip that’s easy to do independently. You need someone around who has a gun (just to scare off the bears if needed), and to be in a group for safety reasons. The kayaks and the trips are all tied to various lodges, so book ahead before traveling to Churchill.''*This post was brought to you in collaboration with Lazy Bear Expeditions. All thoughts on the amazing Beluga encounters are my own.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''How to Get Wildlife Photos Your Friends Will Love – Go to Botswana''Islands of Blue Dolphins''The Amazing Wild Elephants of Sri Lanka''Torres del Paine in Chile is the cherry on top of the Patagonia experience for most hikers. It was my final hike of the two months that I spent in the region and a very fitting way to finish off a trip that I’ll always remember for the physical challenges, the harsh but stunning landscape, and the number of ‘wow!’ moments.''Trekking in Torres del Paine is different than anywhere else in the world. You can pretty much count on very strong winds, rain, mud, and sometimes even snow. It sounds extreme but with the proper gear it’s a lot easier to enjoy it. These are a few things to know before taking on the circuit trek:''There are several starting points''The bus that brings you to the park will make several stops, including the welcome center and the Hotel Las Torres, where I started. You can also get off on the last stop and do the Q trek.''There’s no right or wrong place to start. Personally, I knew that I wanted to do the entire O trek and preferred to finish with the Torres, so I started at the hotel. If you’re unsure whether or not you want to do the whole thing and want to test the W (the shorter trek) first, you can get the boat over and hike to Refugio Grey.''But if you’re toying with doing the full O circuit, you really should!''In case you’re on the fence about going for the full O circuit''You can only see this when doing the full O''By tacking on another three days in Torres del Paine you gain several things:''Some of the most beautiful parts of the trail''are on the part of the trail that the W doesn’t cover. Some say it’s even the best part of the whole trek. Yes, you have to get over the John Gardner pass, but the reward of hiking next to the Southern Patagonian Ice Field all day is so worth it. You’ll get views that most people who visit the park don’t see.''This is from the O too!''The trail is much less crowded''on the back end of the park, and the refugios have a more intimate feel.''The camaraderie with the other hikers is easier to come by''because there are fewer people on the trail. You tend to meet each other, talk, hang out, and get to know each other before joining the masses on the W.''Refugio Dickson, only on the O''The pass (an achievement worth going for)''Convinced yet? Don’t worry, you can do it!''During high season, you have to book ahead of time''Torres del Paine has increased in popularity by 30%\xa0year over year. If hiking during high season, you would be wise to book camping spots ahead of time, which you can do in town or on''Fantastico Sur''and''Vertice Pagatonia''. This wasn’t necessary when I went at the end of March but in January and February, definitely look into it.''About guides, maps, and such''You don’t need a guide and you don’t need a map. I was never confused about where the trail was, because it’s well-marked and well-trodden as well.''You should, however, have travel insurance.''This basic package''covers hiking under 3000 meters (this trek is definitely under that). There is no search and rescue in the park, and this will cover you.''You really need the right tent''My tent (at Refugio Grey)''It’s tempting to bring a normal tent from home, I know, but a typical dome tent does not fare well in the wind in Patagonia. The last thing you want on an 8-day trek is to end up with a tent you can’t use, so get one that is good in heavy winds.''I used an''MSR tent''and it worked great. The key is the sturdy but light tent poles, which will hold up in the wind but won’t weigh you down tremendously. Every ounce counts when you have to carry 8 days worth of provisions!''…and shoes''Don’t believe anyone who tells you that running shoes are just fine to use in Torres del Paine. The trail is very muddy and rocky, and some ankle protection plus a waterproof shell are both important to keeping you dry and blister-free. Remember to lace them up tight and get some nice thick socks as well!''This is the pair of boots''that I recommend and''these are the socks''I suggest.''*If you do get blisters,''Compeed''is a really helpful blister bandage. It’s sweat-proof, so each one can last a couple of days.''…and hiking poles''Check out those clouds! They look that way thanks to the strong winds (this is a view from the O circuit trek)''The wind on two days of the trek in Patagonia literally lifted me up and slammed me forward, it was so strong. My hiking poles saved my face by helping me with balance. They also help tremendously for going downhill, especially if your knees tend to bother you on long hikes, or if this is the first one you’re attempting.''Like with the tent poles, sturdy but light ones are great to have along. Cheap ones break quickly.''These are the ones I used''.''Waterproof your backpack''A rain cover isn’t very useful in Patagonia. Due to the wind, they either blow right off or make tons of noise in your ears as the wind runs through them. Since the wind seriously does reach 100km/hour and over, they can blow right off and then become litter in the park. Nobody wants that!''The solution is to line your backpack with a bin liner/trash bag and to wrap everything inside in its own bag as well.''It’s okay if the backpack gets wet. It’ll dry out in the wind and they’re made to be resilient. The stuff inside will stay dry with the double bag protection. Happy days!''What should you eat?''Breakfasts in a bag''All the powdered food!''I know that’s not very exciting, but in all seriousness, cans, packaged sauces, and anything that creates a lot of waste will be heavy and annoying on the trail. Food is the heaviest item on an 8-day trek, so it’s essential to cut weight wherever possible. There’s so much water available everywhere along the trail, flowing from every glacier and stream, so buying things that just need to be rehydrated works best.''It’s also helpful to pack lunches that don’t need to be cooked that you can\xa0snack on while moving or during short breaks. I’d suggest fruit and nuts. They pack lots of energy and calories for their weight.''One of my lunch bags''Here’s my food list for 8 days (consider that portions depend on your personal\xa0food intake, and keep in mind you’ll be exercising a lot):''1 portion per day of oatmeal with powdered milk, milo, and dried fruit inside''16 bags of tea''2-3 kilos of nuts and dried fruit for lunches''16 Snickers bars (oh yeah I did)''150 grams of pasta, cous cous, or powdered mashed potatoes for dinner per night +1 emergency pasta (just in case)''8 packets of dried soup + dried pasta sauce (tomato soup also works)''Small amounts of cheese and salami to flavor pasta''1 small bottle Pisco poured into a plastic bottle (taking tiny shots before crawling into your sleeping bag on cold nights is surprisingly helpful)''You can buy all of the food you’ll need in the shops in Puerto Natales. I urge you to shop at the small, independent grocers and split your shopping between a few stores. There’s even a dedicated fruit and nut shop with dried mango and melon!''What else to bring (and how to lighten the load)''one week’s worth of food and gear in Patagonia''So what else goes into your pack? Chances are 80% of it will be full with food, and I’d also bring along:''1 small first-aid kit''Only 2 changes of clothes – one for hiking and one for sleeping (yes you will wear the same nasty hiking clothes each day – there’s no point in bringing more clothing because the new stuff will get sweaty and smelly within the first five minutes of your hike anyways). However bring one extra pair of socks and enough underwear for the trip.''1 small and lightweight sleeping bag.''These can get costly, I know! But you will want something that doesn’t weigh much and can keep you warm in sub-zero temps, which you might encounter on the trek.''1 Steripen''– the amount of park visitors has been increasing by 30% year over year. People don’t always respect the rules around water (ie: no bathing or washing directly in the streams) and some people have gotten sick from the water at Campamento Torres. You can avoid any issues by sterilizing your water.''1''Thick sleeping mat''2-3 gas canisters for cooking with the''small grill on top''(dependent on how much tea you’ll drink or if you bring rice or longer-cooking foods)''1 Foldable, lightweight pasta strainer and pot combo''A good knife''1 pack towel''1 hat for sun protection and to keep your ears warm''sunglasses''camp shoes''to give your feet a break from hiking shoes when in camp''1 headlamp''1 battery power pack''Something to put water in. I chose a camelback.''Small toiletries and sunscreen!''I also brought along my camera, of course, and several extra camera batteries. You can find out more about my''camera equipment here''.''You can lighten your load by eating at some of the refugios. The food is great at Refugio Dickson, in particular.''You can also buy some supplies as you go along. Don’t count on it, but know that it’s often possible to get more food and snacks if necessary.''You can shower (sometimes)''Some camps have nice, hot showers that you can use along the trek. It’s much easier to get some shower time in the less crowded camps that are not part of the W. In particular, prepare for queues and limited hot water times at Refugio Grey and Los Cuernos.''The free camps don’t have amenities like showers and sometimes don’t have toilets that flush, but they’re typically in really beautiful settings (and they’re free!).''You can sleep in a refugio (sometimes)''You can book rental tents and rooms in the refugios along the W ahead of time if you just really, genuinely do not want to carry a tent and sleeping bag along with you. If you’re doing the O, however, you have to bring along your own gear. Not all of the camps offer rental services and the value is not good to sleep in the refugios.''I’d always prefer to tote my own tent and have the freedom to sleep in whichever camp I make it to.''Here’s a pretty cool insider’s tip for avoiding the crowds''Stellar photo op''Nobody else was there!''Most people sleep in the free camp at the base of the Torres and hike up to catch the sunrise in the morning.''I know that you might think I’m crazy for suggesting this, especially after the long hike to get to the camp at the base of the Torres, but it’s so worth climbing up to the top twice.''If you go up in the afternoon for sunset, you won’t find much of anyone else up there, in contrast to the sunrise which will be packed with people. Plus, you will know the route already when it’s time to go up the next morning in the dark. It takes about 30-45 minutes to climb to the top and it’s a bit steep, but if you’ve already''done Fitz Roy'', I can assure you it’s not nearly as bad.''The Torres before the sun rose the next morning''Besides, moving keeps you warm. It was snowing when I reached the base of the Torres in late March!''Treat yourself to a hotel after''One of the excursions at the Hotel Las Torres that I stayed at''I stayed at the''Hotel Las Torres''in the park right after the trek and it was the best decision ever. The food was great (it’s all-inclusive) as were the drinks and the activities.''It’s so nice to stay somewhere comfortable for a few days after finishing an 8-day trek, and though this is definitely fancier than a tent, it’s a really welcome change. I also really liked that it included horseback riding and\xa0some treks that aren’t on the usual TDP menu. (you can book a stay''here'').''Such a cool experience to see it from here''One huge benefit of staying at the Hotel Las Torres, apart from the comfort, is access to this amazing viewpoint.''It’s called the Puma trek and it sits on the hotel’s property. It’s also one of the steepest and toughest treks in the entire park. We went there the day after finishing the 8-day trek and I was definitely sore after!''Take a Full Paine tour or rent a car to see all the things you can’t see from the trek afterwards''A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''May 25, 2016 at 9:11am PDT''There are a lot of picturesque places in the park that you don’t see when trekking on the\xa0circuit trail. The park is absolutely full of lakes of all colors, glaciers, different viewpoints, and even waterfalls.

For some, it’s sadly enough to stop them from traveling altogether, even though most of our biggest worries never come to pass.''Hey, I get it, buying a ticket and heading off to a place you’ve never been before, don’t know a soul, aren’t familiar with the language, and don’t yet understand the culture sounds like a really bad idea, especially when you put it that way!''What happens if something goes wrong? What happens if you get lonely? How do you handle it when you have to do it all by yourself?''I definitely had all of these fears and questions myself before my big solo trip. However I learned that most of the things I was scared of never actually happened, and the things that seemed like a big hurdle, such as meeting people, figuring out how to communicate, and staying safe were actually a lot more intuitive than I thought.''Still, it’s natural to have concerns. So here are the top things that tend to worry solo female travelers and suggestions on how to fix them:''Homesickness''Missing home sweet home''One of the most common emails I get from solo female travelers is that they feel homesick. Something has happened – they feel lonely, their heart is broken, or they’ve''just hit a low''.''This can be really disappointing, because your solo journey is supposed to be the best thing ever! After months or even years of saving and planning, it’s supposed to be perfect, right?''Realistically, life is life and even if you are out living your dream, you’re going to have down times. I find that the thing that makes people the most homesick is social media. The Facebook newsfeed is useful for absolutely nothing. Delete the Facebook app off of your phone, I mean it! Keep messenger so that you can communicate with people back home, but don’t look at the newsfeed. If something big happens your friends will tell you.''The homesickness will pass as soon as you are back to doing something stimulating and feeling good. But hey, if it doesn’t, nobody ever said that you had to travel forever and can’t go back home if you want to.''Feeling Unsafe''Staying safe out there''Many women worry that traveling alone will make them a target. After traveling in 53 countries now, about 40 of which I visited alone, I just don’t think this is true. I find that solo traveling actually makes me more aware, that locals look after me more, and that staying safe abroad is similar to staying safe at home.''Carry a dummy wallet, take reasonable precautions (''this list''is a great place to start), and trust your intuition. In many cases, the country you’re visiting might even be safer than where you’re from!''Loneliness''You’ll be okay''You will get lonely, and it’s going to be okay.''Being alone is part of the life experience, both abroad and at home.''Being alone is actually great. Other people inevitably affect how we act and feel, but on our own how we act and feel is completely up to us. This is a chance to get to know your real self, the person who you might not have had a chance to connect with before. It’s a gift to yourself.''You can also fix the loneliness problem by staying somewhere social. Find a hostel on''hostelworld''that has great ratings and stay there for a bit. Or sign up for some kind of activity like''SCUBA diving'', snorkeling, or a walking tour that will have other people involved. You’ll be feeling better in no time!''Heartbroken''It’s okay you’re in wonderland''Heartbreak happens on the road,''I know this all too well''. It’s a tough time to be a solo traveler, but if you think back to every breakup you’ve had, none of them are easy and all of them feel isolating.''Luckily this time, you’ll be out traveling the world and you can make it into an epic adventure! This could actually be the easiest way to move on from a break up, because now you get to do all the things you couldn’t do while coupled. Get excited about the freedom.''Also, treat yourself. Make it a point to do something like a''big hike'', or finally get SCUBA certified, or something that reminds you how badass and cool you are.''Letting go''is a lot easier when you’re out having a blast.''Won’t it be so expensive?''It didn’t cost me more in Mozambique!''Traveling solo is expensive in some cases, but for the most part, no.''If budget is a big concern, just head somewhere like Southeast Asia. You’ll always meet people to split transport costs with, food is cheap, and there aren’t single supplements for tours – at least I never encountered one.''It was about double the price for me to do my''American Southwest road trip''solo, but again, it’s easy to meet people when you travel.''Just put yourself out there''.''Try something new!''There are going to be times when you’re traveling that everything seems to be going wrong and you’ll feel overwhelmed. Remind yourself that this happens at home too. It’s just life.''However, I promise you that you will look back on it and realize that you were really strong, resilient, and you will be proud of yourself for making it through.

Given that, it’s also quite wild and trekking in Kyrgyzstan comes with its own considerations. The following is what I learned during my''8-day trek''out of Karakol:''1) Bring waterproof hiking boots (seriously)''Holey boots''I had soaking wet feet for the first three days of my trek. ‘Wear waterproof boots,’ they said. ‘Oh I will!’ I replied.''My fatal error is my boots, after much love in''Patagonia''and the''American Southwest'', had two gaping holes on them.

Check yours first or buy new!''These are the ones I use''(and will be buying again).''2) Bring sandals with tread''Many a river runs through these mountains''You’ll almost certainly be crossing frigid rivers without bridges, and when the water is higher than your boots can go, it doesn’t matter how waterproof they are, you’ll get them wet. It’s better to remove them to cross, and either do so barefoot or even better, with sandals that have tread.''Tevas''or something similar are great for crossing rivers and for getting out of your boots at night. Double whammy value.''3. Prepare for all kinds of weather''Half the time, sun, and the other half, snow''My trek that spanned 8 days from the end of June into July required a tank top, sunscreen, a ski jacket, and gloves. Sometimes it’s boiling hot and sometimes it’s freezing cold. One night we even got snow!''Even if it feels hot in Karakol, Jyargalan, or wherever you start, plan on cold weather at altitude.''4) Know that there may be no trail''No trail here, but the wildflowers sure were beautiful''For the more popular routes you’ll find a trodden trail, but most of the treks don’t have a trail, markers or even rock cairns.''You’ll be doing a lot of GPS plotting and map checking if you don’t have a guide, which brings me to;''5) Consider hiring a guide''One of the only areas with trails''I almost never take a guide when I trek. I''didn’t in Patagonia''or''Nepal'', but in Kyrgyzstan, at least for the more remote trails (and honestly they are the best ones) please don’t go it alone. On day two of my trek to the Almalu valley, we didn’t see anyone else. Seriously not a soul.''6) You will probably hike through snow at some point''Oh, hey''Even in the middle of summer, the passes can have snow on them. We crossed six passes on my trek, and half of them had snow, which could make for really cold feet. Make sure your shoes can handle it.''7) Here’s a packing list''Clothing-wise. Bring two changes of clothes, 8 pairs of undies, a waterproof jacket, and four pairs of socks. That’s it.''I know that it sounds pretty gross if you’re a''first-time trekker''that you’d only bring two sets of clothing – one for sleeping in and one for trekking in – but trust me, more clothes would just equal a pointless amount of extra weight.

It’s the 8-day trek that was titled''Tyrgen-Ak-Suu-Arashan-Alakyl-Karakol-Telety-Jeti-Oguz''on the itinerary (that’s a mouth full).''One of the highlights''This particular trek begins and ends in Karakol, which is about 5 hours away from the capitol of Bishkek by car.''We hiked 130 km (81 miles) through the Tian Shan Mountain range, over six passes totaling an elevation gain of about 7,500 meters (about 25,000 feet) up and down, with a few relentlessly steep slopes. Some days are a physical challenge and others are shorter and flatter, but all are stunning.''It’s a varied trek, passing through green valley after green valley, with rivers, lakes, sometimes snow, and an ever-present blanket of wild flowers. I would absolutely recommend it.''Here’s the itinerary:''Day one:\xa0Turgen-Aksu valley and\xa0Bozuchuk pass – 12 km\xa0(Sleeping elevation: 2950m)''The beginning –''It was a small group of my guide, Bahram, a porter, Roma, and I on this trek. Things got off to an interesting start when our first bridge was totally covered in water. The river was too powerful to ford so we did what any''Oregon Trail''enthusiast would do: hire a local to help us across.''You can watch that plus some awesome drone footage here:''First he took the bags and then us, one by one. The water lapping at my knees, I kissed my dry feet goodbye and embraced the adventure ahead.''Where we camped''The first day was pretty easy, hiking from one valley over a mountain to the next where we camped for the night.''I didn’t get much sleep that night. I blame this dazzling night sky.''Day two: Summit two passes, finishing with\xa0Ailanysh pass descending into Almalu Valley – 16 km (Sleeping elevation 2650m)''Day two was, admittedly, a tough one. It began with a 1300 meter climb over the first summit, which was unfortunately so clouded in that there was no reward, no view, for the work. I could tell through the sporadic breaks in the fog that it would be amazing if we could see, though.''Next it was a steep descent into the valley where we had to cross the river in one point up to my shins. I had to think happy thoughts to stay positive and warm, but then just before the next summit this showed up you guys:''Wow''And then this:''So beautiful!''Perfection in every direction!''Additionally, we didn’t see another person all day. Not even a local on horseback. Nada.''I love it when that happens.''Day three: Summit Almalu pass (3650m) and descend to Altyn-Arashan hot springs -14km (Sleeping elevation: 2500m)''After a rainy night I woke up to see that the mountaintops had been dusted with snow. On June 29.''Still, what a beautiful sight!''Quick morning drone flight in the Almalu Valley''This was a tough ascent. First we made our way down about 500 meters to an idyllic valley with horses grazing and little waterfalls from the snowmelt in the distance. I saw Bahram cross a bridge and start up a mountain slope.''Please let’s not be climbing THIS mountain'', I thought to myself.''But we were. Oh god, we were.''It was steep the entire way. My foot bent at a 45 degree angle to match the slope, we climbed for hours. I false peaked over and over until we finally reached the top, about 1700 meters later.''‘This is medium difficulty, Kristin’ Bahram chided with 50 kilos strapped to his back.''“What’s high difficulty then?” I wondered.''“Climbing, sleeping on, and doing 11 days on a glacier” he replied. Fair enough.''The valley we’d woken up in far in the distance''Once we did finally reach the top, climbing the last bit through snow, again I was in awe of the panorama surrounding me.''It’s that sense of accommodation and the endorphin rush we hikers love, isn’t it? Well that, and the chiseled calf muscles.''The view on the way down''The day finished at a hot spring, in a more developed little camp with a few other tourists around. It would be the first time we’d camp near anyone else. It would also be a warm and toasty night thanks to the hot springs, my one and only bath all week.''Day 4: Hike to the baseline of Ala-Kul pass (3860m) – 14km (Sleeping elevation: 3300m)''The hot springs from above''Day four brought a bit of welcome relief with a more gradual climb up from the camp. For the first day we did just 4 hours of hiking, with no passes, and no downhills.''It was also the first time I saw a real trail, and other hikers on it. It made me miss the tranquility and backcountry feel of the first few days, though on the other hand, I had plenty of conversations on the way which I always love.''We camped at the base of the pass leading to Alakol Lake, the fixture that makes this trek popular. We were the only ones to camp at the base of the summit rather than going down to the lake, but we’d had such an intense few days we took it a little easier. The glacier views from camp didn’t hurt, either.''Day 5:\xa0Summit Ala-Kul pass (3860m) and descend to Sirota campsite -15km (Sleeping elevation: 2700m)''This was the day I’d see a view that almost brought me to my knees crying in awe.''We had to earn it, though.''The hour-long climb to the pass was steeper than anything I’ve hiked before, requiring scrambling hand and foot in the rock and snow, sometimes sliding backwards.''What we climbed up''It made what we reached the top even sweeter.\xa0It was a triple threat of glaciers, layers of mountains the color of dark chocolate, and a glowing blue lake.''Glaciers galore''The climb down was a rocky and steep one, with a waterfall partway down.''Chillin''Your day can end in the forest camp, and while at first I wondered why we ended the day so early, once I sat at the (month-old at the time of this writing) bar and chatted with the guys working there I realized it would be a social evening. I highly suggest camping there or at least ordering a beer and hanging out before moving on. The vibe is on point.''Hang out''Day six: Hike through Karakol valley to Telity – 6km (Sleeping elevation: 2450m).''This was mostly an easy day, beginning with a walk through the forest blanketed with wildflowers in every color imaginable. Then it flattened out for a few kilometers before turning steep again for about an hour and a half after leaving Karakol national park.''The view leaving the campsite''This was the first hot day of the trek, so it was nice to take it easy, especially after the particularly steep up and down the day before.''Hey, there.''I have to laugh as I write this to you, laying in the tent while a cow breathes heavily and sniffs around my tent. They keep licking the outside of the tent and tripping over the stakes.''This could be your life too while trekking in Kyrgyzstan. I’ll never see cows the same way again.''Day Seven: Summit Telity pass (3820m) and descend to Telity valley – 16km (Sleeping elevation: 2900m)''Day seven was a snowy one, beginning with a barefoot walk through a frigid river. I bid the cows goodbye and made my way for the top. Partway up, Bahram started putting covers on the bottom of his pants for snow. Foreshadowing.''There was snow!''There had been snow on the trail previously, but not as much as there was on this, the final pass.''It was cold, but I also found it to be fun.''I love snow''.''The descent down viscerally reminded me of Switzerland.

The very end is actually a pretty touristy spot, but it’s also where you can arrange to get picked up.''Overall, this was one of the tougher treks I’ve done but also one of the most rewarding. The landscape was phenomenal but the ups were often incredibly steep as were the downs. Half of the days were strenuous and the other were closer to medium or even easy.''Keep in mind that the overall gain and loss in altitude is over 7k meters, as there are six passes in total. For perspective, Everest is 8.9k meters.''I’d still recommend this to anyone who wants to get a real flavor for the beauty in this area, has the time and the interest, and who loves being in nature.

If you walk with your bag on the side that faces away from the street and it’s a cross-body bag, that makes it a lot harder to rob you while driving by on a motorbike, or to swipe it while running by.''Can it be slashed?''It’s important that the straps and the material itself are strong enough that they’re tough to slash.''Bag thieves, especially in Vietnam and Cambodia, are known for targeting people carrying bags that appear to have a weak strap. They can drive by quickly and just slash it before you have a chance to react.''My bags always have wire running through the strap and are lined with Exomesh, which is in the material used in Pacsafe bags that makes it slash-proof.''Can I lock the zippers?''I have two kinds of locks on my bags. One is a loop that you slide the zipper through so that it’s impossible to open quickly, and one is a clip so that the zipper and the purse are connected. That means anyone trying to rob me needs a lot of time and with all that fidgeting, I’d notice.''Does it have RFID blocking technology?''Some thieves use scanners to steal credit card and even passport information. It’s easy for them to do – they need only bump into you, scan your wallet, and make off with your information. This happens worldwide, but is especially common in South America.''If your wallet and/or purse is equipped with a blocker, then they can’t scan your info, and you can blissfully go about your travels.''This is my main purse in Europe''These days, particularly in Europe, I’m a lot more careful and always lock the zipper when I’m out and about.

It had the same kind of vibe that I like so much about''Pai''and''Tonsai''in Thailand, which I guess is to say I like free-spirit types.''Oh, yes.''I just like tattooed, rainbow-haired, pierced hippies,''okay?''But that’s not all there is to Koh Chang.''I visited the island\xa0with two of my''best friends from home''who were in Thailand for a couple of weeks traveling through with me. I had never been to Koh Chang but really wanted to show them a good time.''Given that Koh Chang is much closer to Bangkok and therefore easier to get to for people traveling with a time-budget, not to mention less impacted by the rainy season than Tonsai or Koh Phi Phi would have been in May, I thought it would be a good fit. Plus, I thought given how close it is to Cambodia, the water might be clear and warm''like it was in Otres'', which I found to be so beautiful.''We arrived to find beautiful beaches, reasonable prices, and beautiful sunsets.\xa0The vibe of Koh Chang was just different. Locals hung out with tourists, and were incredibly friendly, especially in Lonely Beach, the backpacker area.''Tranquility at its best''In fact,''Koh Chang is now my favorite island in Thailand.''Sure, Lonely Beach and Koh Chang in general may no longer be the best kept secret, but it’s still an affordable, beautiful slice of paradise with a vibe all its own. Not to mention, the party scene is pretty good without being out of control. Each night just one of the bars in Lonely Beach would be going off, meaning everyone in the area who felt like going out would be at the same bar. It was pretty cool seeing the same friendly people out and about.''It’s easy to talk to people there, many of whom spend a month or longer just on Koh Chang. I always know that if it’s the kind of place where people stick around long-term, it’s a darn good sign.''It’s also absolutely beautiful, with bath-water temperature water. There’s plenty to do, from motorbiking around the island to snorkeling and SCUBA diving, to trekking. It’s the second biggest island after Phuket, so there’s always something new to explore and experience. \xa0Best of all, it truly is a cheap island, and won’t break the bank.''Do it Yourself:''Get to Koh Chang by taking a bus or plane. From Ekamai bus station in Bangkok, air-conditioned busses leave at either 7:30 or 9:30 and go directly to the pier. The ride takes 6 hours and costs 275 baht. Buy a ferry ticket for 80 baht and take a flat-rate songthaew once on Koh Chang to your destination for 100 baht. They will be waiting at the ferry terminal. Ferries leave every 30 minutes or so.''You can also fly to Koh Chang on Bangkok Airways. Get to Trat and then, it’s often best to take a combination ticket service from the airport all the way to your accommodation for 900 baht round trip. Otherwise, you may encounter an incredibly high songthaew cost to get to the airport once back on the mainland.''If staying in Lonely Beach, there are plenty of options from free, if you eat your food there, to around 250 baht. It’s a small area and you can wander instead of booking ahead if you prefer.''Since my friends had a higher budget and wanted to stay somewhere a bit nicer, we stayed at''Warapura Resort'', which has an included breakfast, beautiful views, and air conditioning. It was in the perfect location in Lonely beach, close to the bars but in a nice and quiet location so we could sleep in peace.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Koh Rong and Rabbit Island in Photos''Offbeat Travel: Climbing to the Railay Beach Lagoon''The 8 Chillest Places in Asia''I’ve had my fair share of trolls.

To him it was simple; accept Jesus into your heart, repent your sins, and be saved. He spent many years after that trying to spread the message and while various churches rejected him.

He had looked into it and discovered that for closer to $65 per person, one could climb the mountain in one day and avoid staying in Laban Rata, the lodge at the 6 km mark that held a monopoly on the area, and therefore set the prices sky high for an overnight stay (and food).''Oh dear. What are we in for?''The catch is, to summit Mt. Kinabalu in one day, one must make it to the top by 1pm, leaving only 5 and a half hours to make it to the peak at 4,095 meters (13,440 feet). \xa0This would seem entirely doable given it is only 8.7km (5.4 miles) to the top, however, given the elevation gain of 2229 meters (7,313 feet), and the thinning of the air as each foot is placed higher, this is no easy task.''The hike was, to put it bluntly, brutal. \xa0There were no flat parts to speak of.''If it weren’t for Neil, who graciously carried my camera, water, and food, and who also kept up a very positive attitude that lifted me as well, I doubt I would have made it to the top.''The beginning was only a taste of what was to come. It was mainly stone steps punctuated by the occasional steep wooden staircase. \xa0Each half kilometer seemed like a feat of mankind and leg strength. \xa0At about 15 minutes per half km, we were making decent time.''Around the 6th kilometer, I started to worry I might not make it. \xa0I sat down next to Neil, panting, as we took a peanut butter sandwich break. \xa0It was a bit tougher than we both had bargained for.''“I can’t get this close and not make it to the summit,” he said.''I realized that I couldn’t, either.''The final 2.7 kilometers were the toughest. \xa01000 meters of elevation was gained just over that short period. It started to take me 25 minutes per half kilometer. \xa0I asked Neil to go ahead, just in case I might not make it by 1pm. \xa0Just as I thought I might not be able to go any further, I remembered I had brought along my iPhone, and plugged in my headphones. \xa0Why hadn’t I thought of this sooner? Music always gets me through the tough parts.''It’s getting steep!''Clouds of icy rain formed around me as I gripped the rope and climbed ever higher, as quickly as my legs, lactic acid screaming through them, would allow me. About .7 km from the top, I started to feel dizzy from the altitude.''“Just a bit further!

It read 12:57pm. \xa0We had done it. Just barely.''On top of the world.''Finally, a feeling of elation came over me. \xa0The view was beautiful.''Clouds resting at the summit''If asked only the afternoon before, I would have had no idea I’d summit Southeast Asia’s highest mountain. The serendipity of travel never ceases to amaze.''Beauty''We took in the vistas for about 20 minutes before heading back down the mountain. \xa0Unfortunately for me, what goes up must come down. \xa0We had 8.7km of stone steps to take on and complete before 5pm.''All in all, the climb was, of course, worth it. \xa0I proved a little something to myself and realized, through sore knees and walking like an 80-year old down stairs for the next two days, that with a positive attitude and determination, almost anything is possible.''Do it yourself (2D1N):''From Kota Kinabalu, take a mini bus (at a cost of 20 RM) from''Merdeka Field''the day before. \xa0Ask the bus driver to drop you at a guest house close to the park. \xa0I chose''Kinabalu Mountain Lodge'', which was only 2km from the park entrance and a serene place to spend the evening. The price was right at 35 RM per night for a dorm room.''Booking in advance is recommended, as the daily total number of climb permits is capped at 135, and they can easily book out during high season. However, if you are hiking during shoulder seasons, or simply want to try your luck to get a lower, last-minute price, arrive at park headquarters the day before your intended hike and reserve a permit and guide. Try to arrange with the guide to take off prior to 8am the following day (gate closes at 10:30am).''Fees: Pay the park entrance fee of RM 200 (USD $48), and hire a guide for RM 230 (USD $55). It is compulsory to hire a guide, but the cost can be divided between up to 5 persons. The final fee is RM 33 (USD $11) to be driven to the gate where the climb officially starts.

The United States is''not a super budget destination'', after all.''I was quite pleased to find that it was easy to save in some areas so that I could splurge in others.''Gas in the US is some of the cheapest worldwide'', there are tons of free camping options available, and the US national Park’s pass is a steal!''To do my''ten-day itinerary''which is a variation on the Grand Circle road trip, as of this writing in May 2017, it would cost a total of $1,104 or $110 per day, including''a camper van rental'', food, gas, camping, plus a couple of optional splurge options below.''Note: It was definitely more expensive because I was solo. If you had just one other person, you’d be able to split the costs almost perfectly in half. If you had two other people along, take it down to one third and so on. The more the merrier (until you run out of room and start elbowing each other).''Here’s the breakdown:''Activities – $95 or $869:''You should probably do this''The US national parks pass is an incredibly good deal. Please do yourself a favor and just get one. For $80, you and the whole carload of people with you can get into any national park in the US for an entire year. When I compare that to the $91 daily fees in''the Serengeti''or\xa0what\xa0would it would cost for a family get to go to Disneyland instead, I really am struck by how good of a deal the US national parks are.''Simply buy it in person at any one of the national parks on''this list''. I bought mine in''Zion''.''Keep in mind that state parks like the Valley of Fire and Dead Horse State Park are not included with this national parks pass. For those you will have to pay between\xa0$10-$15 at the kiosk upon entry. They’re worth it, though.''Since I saved in so many other\xa0areas for my trip, and also because YOLO, I decided to splurge as well. My helicopter flight to the Grand Canyon at sunset ($574) and the day trip to''white pocket''($199) were both experiences that cost extra but were very worth having.''Transport costs – $837''Free camping with my green and purple chariot''When I took this trip the average price I\xa0paid for gas was around $2.40 per gallon ($8.88/litre). For most foreign visitors, this is going to be pretty cheap compared to home. It even feel cheap to me coming from California where the prices are, on average, about a dollar higher per gallon.''Just remember, that the even though the gas is cheap, the distances are vast in the US.''I spent a total of $287 on gas and traveled for over 2000 miles in a vehicle with decent mileage.''The other issue is your wheels. How are you going to get around? If you’ll be renting a car anyway, it’s worth considering''getting a camper van''instead. The rate for mine was $55/night, which isn’t bad if you’d have to rent a car anyway.''Then your accommodation apart from the van fee can be absolutely free. Here’s how:''Accommodation – Free''Just me and my van''Apart from a couple of nights next to the entrance of Zion national Park where I paid $40/night for a campsite, I did not pay any camping fees during the nine days that I traveled around the southwestern US, and I did this completely legally!''What I hadn’t\xa0realized before this trip is that there is a lot of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land that is owned by the public out in Utah. That means that you can find free camping in these areas as long as you leave no trace and are not visible from the highway.''This website''is really helpful if you need some help finding options in your area.''Now I like a good deal as much as anyone, but the biggest reason why I tended to camp on BLM land was because it was in such beautiful settings. One night I would be on the rim of a canyon and the next I would be sleeping under a canopy of stars, waking up to a glorious sunrise, and taking in a view that went miles in every direction and did not show me another soul. The alternative is paying to camp in the parking lot just to have amenities. No thanks!''The only caveat is there are no services, no hook ups, nothing. By using the land you agree\xa0to leave no trace and pack waste\xa0back out with you. This is easy to do in a camper van with its own kitchen, sink, water, refrigerator, and solar panel to keep you powered up. It’s like having a little moving home. I loved that I didn’t have to set anything up like a tent, and that regardless of the weather, I would have a comfortable bed each night.''The other thing to consider is BLM camping is almost always down a dirt road. Watch the weather, and pay close attention to the roads because some of them are truly terrible and it’s not worth getting stuck in sand or popping a tire. If one spot doesn’t work out, there is probably another one not too far away.''Food – $162:''Ate dinner a few steps from here, cooked at the picnic area of the state park.''Restaurants and grocery stores in and around national parks tend to be more expensive, so if you can shop and plan ahead of time and have space for imperishables, do so in bigger towns.''I cooked all of the food that I ate during the camper van adventure as opposed to eating at restaurants. I loved being able to just pull up somewhere and look at the beautiful view while making dinner. In some cases I did pay more money for healthy and organic food at boutique grocery stores, but it wasn’t much different than what I would pay back at home in California. For me, it was a moot point as\xa0food is a cost I would have anywhere.''Mother nature made a perfect frame''Give or take\xa0$1000 for a full van to do this trip, it’s actually a fantastic deal, especially if you can get more than one person to join.

They are accessed via different locations and have quite a few things that set them apart from each other\xa0as well. Then came the question of which to choose or if it made sense to visit both.''The photographer in me couldn’t resist photographing both and the writer in me couldn’t resist covering both here on the blog, so I visited each\xa0at their respective best times of day for lighting. This probably also means I visited at the most popular time of day, and in one of the most popular months (May).''It was a crowded and claustrophobic but an also must-have experience because of the way that those canyons swirl and curve into some kind of\xa0trippy corridor that feels like it’s leading you to the bowels of Earth. You have to see it to believe it, and even then you still might not.''Both canyons are located on Navajo land and the only way to see them is by taking a guided tour. I only saw\xa0Navajo guides, which made it feel more authentic and connected.''If you’re trying to choose between the two, here is an honest firsthand account of both Upper and Lower Antelope Canyon:''Lower\xa0Antelope''Looking up in Lower Antelope''I visited the Lower Antelope Canyon first since at the time that I visited in May, 10:10 AM was the optimal time for light.''I booked my tour ahead of time with''Dixie Ellis''(you can also book the same experience with''Ken’s Tours'') for $26 plus an additional $8 for the Navajo Nation permit fee. I figured that at a prime time like that, it would be all booked up but a friend I met the day before was able to join me, so don’t fret if you didn’t book ahead of time. There may still be availability!''So what was great and not-so-great about Lower Antelope? Let’s start with the good stuff:''Perks''So beautiful''Longer''The standard tour in Lower Antelope lasts for one hour and the photography tour lasts for over two hours.\xa0The tour through lower antelope Canyon last for much longer because the canyon itself is a lot longer. This was both a blessing and a curse for me because as much as I loved to be in there and see it, I found it to be a slightly dizzying experience as well. If you are not bothered by small and enclosed spaces this won’t be a big concern.''Slightly less crowded''Being real, both canyons are incredibly popular and quite crowded. However, Lower Antelope Canyon is a bit less so. Even without being on a photography tour, I was able to get photos without other people in them from time to time.''Got my solo shot''Cheaper''Lower Antelope Canyon is a lot cheaper than Upper Antelope Canyon at a total of $34. As tours go, neither is particularly expensive but if you are on a strict budget\xa0then lower might be the better choice for you.''Drawbacks''No beams but still beautiful''Stairs''One big reason why people shy away from Lower\xa0Antelope Canyon is the stairs. They’re honestly not a big deal, though. If you are mobile and don’t have problems with stairs in everyday life, these won’t trip you up. Don’t worry about them being treacherous. This would really only be an issue for the elderly or those who have mobility limitations.''No light beams''It is rare to see the light beams in Lower Antelope Canyon that have made Upper Antelope so famous. The light still does get\xa0through and make the walls glow, but you won’t get those iconic beams shining through to the ground.''Most of the photos you have seen of sand falling to the ground were probably also taken in upper rather than lower antelope Canyon. In upper they regularly threw up sand so that we could see it reflected by the light, but in lower they said that they did not want to create dust. I suspect that on the photography tour\xa0in lower that they do throw some dust on the walls to photograph.\xa0I don’t know that for sure, though.''Upper Antelope''Amazing colors''Upper Antelope Canyon is located a few miles away on the opposite side of the road. For this one, you’ll climb into a 4 x 4 truck and be caravanned over to the entrance. I highly suggest paying the $10 more for\xa0‘prime time,’ which is when the light beams shine through. I was able to hit both canyons during their prime times by booking Lower Antelope for 10:10 and Upper Antelope for 12:30.''This is the canyon where the guides will throw up dust into the light beams and some will even take your photo for you, which is nice for a solo traveler! I chose''Adventurous Antelope Canyon''and paid $60. Since I had already paid the $8 Navajo Nation fee, I was able to show the receipt and not have to pay twice.''Perks''A post shared by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Jun 17, 2017 at 9:35am PDT''Light Beams''The light beams are the biggest perk of visiting Upper Antelope Canyon. Most of the famous photos that you’ve seen of these canyons, including the most expensive photo in the world by Peter Lik which''sold for $6.5 million'', were taken in this canyon.''However, this is highly dependent on time of day so keep that in mind when planning your trip. Ideally the sun will be directly overhead, which in May was at 1 PM. If you’re a photographer, this is probably the better canyon for you to visit if you’re dying to get those iconic light beam shots.''Those famous light beams''No Stairs''If the idea of climbing stairs in a narrow canyon makes you dizzy just thinking about it, take solace in the fact that this is just an easy, flat, and shorter walk through the canyon. That said, I think this also leads to one of the biggest drawbacks which is that you have two-way traffic going through the canyon. It’s already quite narrow, so this\xa0makes it feel even more claustrophobic.''Drawbacks''But you do get the falling sand''More Crowded''As mentioned in the previous section, this is the narrower canyon of the two and it’s more popular. We\xa0were not even allowed to bring backpacks inside since it gets so crowded in there!''After you walk through the canyon, the guides will ask you to turn around and walk back through going the other direction. That makes it even more crowded and packed in Upper Antelope. In Lower Antelope, traffic is mostly just one way, though those on photo tours will occasionally\xa0pass you going the other direction.''We took turns taking photos but it felt super rushed''More Expensive''Upper Antelope Canyon is more expensive than Lower. In fact, it was more than\xa0double. However the guides prioritized us getting photos, and they even took some for us, which was a nice perk that Lower did not offer.''Towards the end, the guide took this photo for me''Would I\xa0recommend that you choose one over the other, or try to do both? It’s hard to say, because both have their perks. It really comes down to your intentions. For photographers, it probably makes sense to go to Upper Antelope Canyon. As you can see by comparing the photos, I got better ones out of Upper.''If the light beams don’t matter that much to you and you want a slightly more relaxed and cheaper experience, however, head to Lower Antelope Canyon.''Should you do both? Well, to be brutally honest, neither experience was all that enjoyable. In both cases I felt like we were\xa0being herded through the canyon and sharing the experience with tons of other people. That’s just how it is with something as beautiful and popular as these canyons. Both were absolutely beautiful, but both are very narrow and enclosed as well.''In the end I’m glad that I got to have the experience\xa0and the photo opportunity. These canyons are a bucket list item for good reason, but it’s probably not something that I would repeat.''Tips for Page:''The nice thing about this part of Arizona is you also have horseshoe bend nearby, which is perfect at sunset, as well as Lake Powell and''White Pocket'', the Wave, and Vermillion Cliffs National Monument.''The town itself is not particularly amazing, but I was able to find a''free BLM campsite''that was walking distance to Lake Powell and camped there overnight twice in my''camper van'', which was beautiful and peaceful.''For more, click on the link below for the entire 9-day Southwestern itinerary.''Read next: The Perfect American Southwest Road Trip Itinerary''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''I’m super into my travel photos.

There will rarely be services, like running water, paved trails, bathrooms, and electric hookups. The benefit is almost no crowds, free camping in the wilderness, and natural areas that are no less impressive.''I did the Coyote Gulch trail in one day via the sneaker route, which does involve using a rope to climb down a 250-foot vertical rock and navigating by GPS, but it was also one of the best camping and hiking experiences of my life.''More on that here.''Recommended sights:''Zebra Slot Canyon, Peek-a-boo and Spooky Slot canyons, Coyote Gulch, Devil’s Garden''Camp:''Find BLM camping off of dirt road offshoots and drive for long enough that you’re not\xa0visible from the road.

The cost to get in is $15 and it’s a pretty small park, but the views at sunset are incredible!''While the main viewpoint at Dead Horse point did have about 25\xa0people around, the majority of the view was totally open and had plenty of spots where one could enjoy it in privacy.

Just watch out for potholes in the dirt tracks.''Click here to find it on the map''.''Sunrise at Mesa Arch,\xa0Canyonlands National Park''Mother nature made a perfect frame''Mesa Arch is easily the most famous feature of Canyonlands National Park, particularly at sunrise. As you can see, everyone wants to get a shot of that sun lighting up the arch and the sweeping view of the canyon below. I would recommend getting there about an hour or more before the sunrise if you want an optimal spot for photos. This one was taken from the right side of the arch.''Arches National Park''Double arches!''After my Mesa Arch sunrise, I drove to Arches National Park to check out some arches quickly before continuing on.

There are plenty of boulders on the cliff edge that you can perch on until the sun sets, and I can’t think of many better places to hang out, either!''Upper and Lower Antelope Canyon''Taken in the upper canyon''Chances are good you’ve seen those trippy photos of the upper and lower Antelope Canyon on social media and are dying to see them yourself. Like horseshoe bend, the Antelope Canyon truly is gorgeous to see in person. Those swirling red rocks are so unique.''They are also popular.

You’ll have a hard time if you’re claustrophobic, which I am, but only mildly.''I did both the upper and lower and both are worth seeing (I have a''comparison written here''), as the lower tends to have more colors and the upper has those famous light beams, but only at certain times of day.

Taken at white pocket''The next most famous stop in Arizona is usually the wave, famous for the wave-like shape and color of the rock. Only about 20 people get permits to see the wave each day, and you’ll need to apply at 9am the day before in Kanab, Utah. Since I was in Paige, I opted to see White Pocket instead which almost nobody else was visiting. I thought it was incredibly impressive! If you can’t get into the wave, make this your alternative.

It’s a massive sequence of sedimentary rock formations stretching almost 2 million acres from Zion to the Grand Canyon. It’s an outdoor enthusiast’s dream\xa0with hiking, rock climbing, bouldering adventures, 4×4 roads, and wide open spaces that you can climb all over and free camp in. It’s more rugged as well,\xa0without the paved roads, busses, and crowds of the national parks but without the amenities, maintained trails, and services, either.''The beauty is in the remoteness\xa0and the freedom to enjoy it, as well as the associated self-reliance.''It was tough to pick which hike out of probably thousands that I could do in the Grand Staircase, but after seeing a few photos of the giant arches, my heart was set\xa0on Coyote Gulch. This one is best accessed via the nearby town of Escalante off scenic byway 12, the same one you’d find yourself on if you’re driving from Zion or Bryce to Arches National Park.''Boom, right at the entry''There are four different entry points for Coyote Gulch, and most of them involve at least one overnight in the canyon and potentially a 4×4 road as well. I didn’t have the gear with me for an overnight hike, or the time.\xa0So I decided to just go and try out the ‘sneaker route’ and hope for the best.''Turns out that it is doable in one day and it’s one of the best hiking experiences I’ve had! You just have to do a bit of trail finding and scale a 250-foot rock face to get down. It sounds tougher than it is, though, so don’t worry!''The Route''Since I wanted to do this in just one day, and I was solo without a friend to drop me off at one end of the gulch and pick me up at the other, I did this as an out-and-back hike to Jacob Hamblin Arch (or the ‘sneaker route’ or the water tank trailhead) that ended up being 12 miles and took up most of the day, particularly since I stop so often to film and take photos.''Before embarking on this trail, I’d read that it’s hard to find in places, but I didn’t have any trouble.''I have a particularly bad sense of direction — I’m talking no internal compass at all people — and I didn’t get lost!''A rock cairn on the trail''The trail is marked by rock cairns, which are stacks of rocks to help guide your way. Each time I reached one, I could see another in the distance. With those, I found the trail easy to follow. I had also downloaded Utah as an offline map on the free maps.me smartphone app and found that they had all of the major arches in the gulch already plotted in the app. I’d highly recommend downloading this back when you still have service (you won’t in most of the Grand Staircase) and bringing it along on your smart phone.''From the water tank it’s a two mile walk over rocks and in sand before reaching the descent point down to Jacob Hamblin arch. You’ll see a rock that is hollow underneath that you can tie your rope around, or you might find that there’s already one there.''I brought at 200-foot rope along which I bought in Escalante at''Utah Canyon Outdoors''for $100, only to find when I arrived that one was already tied to the rock and had been left there by some kind soul.''It is steep and a little bit nerve wracking, truth be told, but it wasn’t as terrifying as I thought it would be. It wasn’t climbing down that would have been difficult, though it’s a long way down at about a 45 degree grade. Rather it’s coming back out that would be tough without a rope. I suggest bringing one along since you can’t count on there being a solid one there waiting for you.''Wow''Once you’re down, the first thing you’ll see to the left is the massive Jacob Hamblin arch.''Be sure to wander around it for a little while before turning in the other direction to proceed further down to the other arches and the small waterfall. It’s worth seeing it from several angles.''Near the arch. This hike was a solid 10/10''From there, I navigated with my app to the Coyote Natural Bridge and realized that the trail always runs along the water line, and sometimes through it.''For this reason I suggest bringing a way to clean or''filter the water''so that you don’t have to carry much throughout the day, and''waterproof hiking boots''lest you end up doing most of the hike barefoot, which is probably fun, too.''The coyote natural bridge''The canyon stays beautiful throughout the entire hike, with little waterfalls and areas where the design of the rock, so artfully carved by the water, looks like it couldn’t be of this world.''taking a rest on the way''There’s also a little hidden lagoon,''which you can find here''.''Special thanks to the lovely couple who I ran into on the trail for suggesting that I check this out. I didn’t get the chance to tell them\xa0that I love them for letting me know it exists.''Nobody around, so it’s skinny dipping time!''My terminus for the day was cliff arch and the waterfall. Be careful here as the trail gets a bit confusing with a bunch\xa0of social trails branching off and ending in odd places. I lost the trail for a while and had to navigate my way back.''Cliff arch, why you so hard to find?''Stevens Arch is meant to be\xa0amazing too and would require a few extra miles. Unfortunately I couldn’t make it that far, but with less time spent taking photos and videos, a normal hiker could probably reach it before turning around and heading back if you’re up for a long day.''A little waterfall near cliff arch''From there I turned back and made my way back to Jacob Hamblin Arch, back up the rock face, and walked the two miles to the car. I started my hike at 7am and finished before 3pm, walking a total of 12 miles that were mostly flat, but still exhausting since they were almost exclusively through sand.''For reference, there are several different ways to get into Coyote Gulch and each have their advantages and disadvantages. The following would require a multi-day hike for most hikers:''Hurricane Wash: This one appeared to be the most popular entry point and is a hike mainly down a sandy “wash” (where the water sometimes forms a river in the rain but is otherwise dry) before reaching the canyon. I passed by the parking lot on my drive and saw plenty of hikers getting ready for their trips. I didn’t see the benefit in adding the extra mileage on since the main things to see are in the canyon but if you want to do this route and avoid the rappelling''this guide by a fellow Kristen''is helpful.''Red Well: Similar to hurricane wash, you’ll be hiking for about 7 miles before entering the canyon.''Crack in the wall: Another\xa0option to shorten the hike. It’s the same turnout as the water tank where I parked for the Jacob Hamblin arch entry called Forty mile ridge, but you need a 4×4 vehicle to get through the sand for the final two miles of the drive.''Getting there''The landscape is just breathtaking''First, get to Escalante off of highway 12 and navigate to''Jacob Hamblin Arch using Google maps''off of BLM 200.''The drive to the trailhead will take you about an hour and a half to two hours to go the 36 miles on BLM 200 unless you’re driving a 4×4.''Admittedly, I do tend to drive like a grandma\xa0on gravel and corrugated dirt roads because I know it’s easy to lose control on roads like that, so I was probably averaging 30 mph. It took me about 2 hours\xa0each way.''The van that you see in the video is a''camper van from Jucy'', which I highly recommend.''Pit stop at the Devil’s Garden''The drive is gorgeous, with plenty of worthy slot canyons to stop at and the hoodoos at the Devil’s Garden on the way. It’s a really short pit stop that I’d highly recommend watching out for as you come down BLM 200. It will be on your right.''Too cool!''Be forewarned that some of the cattle grates will cause you to bottom out, so drive over them carefully and always look to see if there’s an option for going around it, particularly on the turnoff road for the Jacob Hamblin Arch!''Also remember, these roads can get more or less impassable if there are heavy rains and they get muddy.''Camping''When I was researching for this hike I saw a lot of people asking questions about permits. They are available at the trailhead and only required for overnight hikes. They are also free, unless I missed something!''I never realized it before this trip to Utah, but the Grand Staircase Escalante and the surroundings is BLM land, meaning that it’s owned by the public. You can camp, hike, and adventure in there completely for free.\xa0I didn’t pay for a campsite for the whole week and a half that I spent exploring southern Utah after that!''It’s easy to find the campsites, just look for a small dirt road off of the main ones and most of the time there are little areas where you can pull off and camp. You can’t be visible from the main road and\xa0are required to leave no trace, which in my camper van, was easy to do.''Just me and nothingness as far as the eye could see''What I loved about camping out there near the trailhead was the feeling that nobody else was around (and to be honest, nobody really was). It was just me and the wilderness for miles. It was humbling and incredibly exciting at the same time to really have everything I was looking at to myself.''Just nature as far as the eye can see''In contrast to the national parks, the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is quiet, vast, wild, rugged, and to me, all the better for it.''Overall, Coyote Gulch is now one of my favorite hikes that I’ve done. The minimal\xa0crowds, the abundance of arches, and the thrill of the adventure all made this an awesome experience.''If you’re in southern Utah and you want to experience something a little different, a little more adventurous, and a lot less crowded, check out Coyote Gulch.''READ NEXT: An Awesome American Southwest Road Trip Itinerary''*Some of the companies mentioned here are partners who helped make this article possible, and some links are affiliate links.

It was just as notorious then for its chain-link hand-holds and incredibly narrow trail in places, plus the switchbacks to get up there.''The risk was worth the reward for me. Once I came to the top I was surrounded by the orange walls of Zion Canyon and greeted with a view that seemed to go on forever into the distance. It made an impression as one of the most magnificent sights I had seen in my young life.''There were a few other people up there with me, but it wasn’t yet the fan favorite that it is these days.''Since I was in Zion National Park 10 years ago, the visitor numbers have nearly doubled from a''yearly 2.7\xa0million to 4.3 million people''!''Remembering the precarious trail and desiring to try something new, when I returned in this May\xa0I opted for the Observation Point trail this time instead of Angel’s Landing.\xa0I’m left feeling that Observation Point is actually the better out of the two hikes for several reasons:''This beautiful view awaits (that part sticking out in the center is Angel’s Landing)''Though it’s tougher, it’s less narrow''The Observation Point trail is less dangerous\xa0and terrifying than the Angel’s Landing hike. Though there are some cliff edges, there are no narrow, exposed edges that will leave you clinging to the rock or chains, but the overall hike is actually longer and more strenuous.''Both hikes can be quite exposed in the sun (I recommend starting early so that you can be in the shade if hiking in the warm months), both are out-and-back day hikes, both are on well-maintained and popular trails, and both will involve switchbacks. Neither require a permit and both are accessed via the park shuttle.''Here are the stats:''Trailhead:''Angel’s Landing: The Grotto''Observation Point: Weeping Rock''Distance''Angel’s Landing: 5 miles (8 km)''Observation Point: 8 miles (12.9 km)''Elevation gain:''Angel’s Landing: 1488 feet (454 meters)''Observation Point:\xa02100 feet (640 meters)''Hiking time:''Angel’s Landing: 2-5 hours''Observation Point: 3-7 hours''Even though Observation Point is technically more strenuous and longer, I think it’s a better pick for those who are scared of heights or aren’t as sure-footed, but who still want to go on a solid, challenging day hike.

It earned its name because it was said to be so high that only the angels could reach the top. While that view''is''undeniably amazing,\xa0you can actually see more from Observation Point.''Since Observation Point is even higher than Angel’s Landing, you are actually looking down on the Angel’s Landing viewpoint and not only can you see the top of the canyon walls, but you can see even more of the canyon itself from up above.''Angel’s Landing feels a bit more like you’re down among the giant rocks and cliffs, and Observation Point feels a bit more like you’re above them. While I think both have their benefits, I find that the view from Observation Point is just a bit more spectacular.''Loved how the early morning light made this look''The hike itself is more beautiful''I recall the trail being more of a means to an end than an enjoyable hike when I did Angel’s Landing.

There’s just so much\xa0information out there\xa0about different models and reasons why they’re great, plus\xa0trying to decide how much you really need to spend to get amazing photos. I know, I’ve been through this process several times.''When I’m looking at which camera to buy I consider the portability, user-friendliness, how much customization is possible, such as changing lenses and shooting in a myriad of conditions, and how crisp and sharp the photos look.''That’s why I think the''Sony a6000''is the best camera for travel photography in 2017. It’s at a lower price point than it has ever been before, and it works with different lenses so that I can put on a telephoto, a wide-angle, or a 50mm lens and get all kinds of different artistic styles. The Sony a6000 also features the best sensor\xa0in the market right now which basically means it takes a really great picture.''The camera can also talk to my phone without an internet connection, and the apps make looking like a pro way easier while you’re still learning the ropes.''Here’s what makes the''Sony a6000''a better travel camera than the others out there:''Why Sony and not Nikon, Fujifilm, or Canon?''Sony makes the best sensors in the business right now. Their cameras take amazingly clear and crisp photos and that’s why they’re so popular right now. Chances are good that your favorite photographers and Instagrammers use Sony.''Otherwise, it comes down to personal preference. I like the apps that Sony Play Memories offers, I like that the camera is so lightweight and yet takes such crisp and beautiful photos, and I like that it’s so easy to use. Here are a few more reasons why I like this one in particular:''It shoots great photos even on auto''Most professional photographers will tell you that shooting on auto is basically devil worship, but when you’re learning, it’s just what you do! This camera has three different auto settings, plus different ‘scene’ settings such as moving object, sunset, night, and portrait, and they are all pretty good.''When you’re first starting out, you may not really know how to shoot on manual yet, (though it is''important for low-light''and night shooting situations), and I think this camera is great even if you don’t know all about aperture and shutter speed yet.''Shot this sunset with the sunset scene setting''It Can talk to your phone''With my old camera couldn’t do was talk to my phone. If I was taking a selfie, I wouldn’t know what it looked like until I ran back and checked.''However this camera is controllable through the Sony PlayMemories app on your phone. You can use it to see exactly what you’re shooting if you want to be in the photo, and you can use it as a remote control if you are shooting a long exposure and need the camera to remain still.\xa0This feature is fantastic particularly if you travel solo and''are taking photos of yourself''.''Shot this of myself using the smart remote''you can also download photos directly to your phone right after you take them without having to use a computer. So you can upload it right on the spot!''Plus, there are little tricks you can do with it to make it look like you know way more about photography than you actually do with their apps, which brings me to:''There are really cool apps''Another major benefit of this camera is the apps that you can download onto\xa0it. They run from $5 to $20 and they make things that were previously difficult to do much easier.''Smooth reflection''If you want to make the water look like it is standing still, you would normally need\xa0to take a long exposure, leaving the aperture open for several seconds or minutes. In a situation with lots of light, that can be challenging without an ND filter to greatly darken the lens. Photos will generally appear way too bright.''However with this app, you can take a long exposure in broad daylight because it blends several frames together. I also like this for if I want to take a photo of something standing still, like a building or a tree, and there people are walking by. Since it stitches so many photos together, anything moving, like people, will not show up.''a long-exposure shot in broad daylight using the smooth reflection app''Time lapse''I love this app! It has several settings depending on the situation and I have used it to shoot amazing sunsets and the night sky in the Serengeti.''You don’t have to know how to mess with the settings, you just go into this app, select which situation most pertains to the time lapse you want to take, and sit back in with the camera do its thing.''Star trails''This is a really cool function that lets you point the camera at the night sky while it takes a movie of the stars moving and leaving trails behind them. I have a lot of fun playing with this one!''In my video of Tanzania below (which was partially shot with an a6000), you can see both apps in action. For time lapse examples, skip to 0:15, 1:00, and 1:04 and for Star trails, skip to 1:06.''It is lightweight and easy to take along on trips or hikes''When you’re out hiking, especially if it’s a multi-day trek, then you know how important it is to cut down your weight. Even just walking around a city with a super heavy camera eventually kills my neck and my back, so my main motivation for getting this camera was to upgrade my photos but also to decrease my pack’s weight.''Since this is a ‘mirrorless’ camera, it is much slimmer and sleeker than a lot of other DSLRs on the market and I don’t think it compromises the quality one bit:''Love that sun burst in Canmore, Alberta (''here are 25 more photos''from the trip, all taken with the Sony a6000)''It’s affordable!''Sometimes learning about photography can feel overwhelming because it seems like you need all kinds of crazy expensive equipment to do what the pros do. While their equipment is certainly helpful, you can take amazing photos without needing all of that.''At $500 for the camera, for sure this is more expensive than plenty of point-and-shoot on the market, but for the quality of photos that you get and all of the bells and whistles that come with it, this is an incredible camera for the price.''To me, spending one or $200 more right from the beginning to get the kind of camera that is great for beginners and great for those who are more advanced once you learn how to use it, it’s better to start with this one then going for a cheaper alternative that has limitations.''One of my most popular photos, taken with the Sony a6000 from a moving boat''I have used this camera for over two years now and still think it’s one of the best tools in my arsenal, which you can''see here''.''Click here to see more specifications and to purchase''(affiliate link -if you make a purchase through them I get a small commission at no cost to you. It helps keep this site going!)''By the way, just to remain transparent with you, I did recently upgrade to the Sony A7s. I don’t recommend that camera here because it is damn expensive and it is not as good at shooting in auto as my a6000 is. I mainly bought it for the superior video quality and especially its low-light capabilities since I’m a big fan of astrophotography, and since these days I tend to shoot more in manual. That said, the a6000 shoots great video and night skies\xa0as well. It’s an excellent little camera and I still use it from time to time when I want something lighter or a backup!''Read Next: How I Edit My Travel Photos''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''A Full Guide to The Camera Gear that I Use''How to Take Great Travel Photos with an iPhone''How to Take Great Travel Photographs and Videos''I’m going to say it: Santa Barbara is the prettiest town in California.''I mean it.''I will shout it from mountaintops.''I realize this is a bold statement, there is certainly tough competition, but where else do you have this:''By Damian Gadal''and this:''By SBA John Wiley''right next to each other?''Few places'', that’s the answer.''Santa Barbara has that''je ne sais quoi''that’s missing from other locales.''Admittedly, I’m a little biased having moved there at 18 for school (I’m a Gaucho for life). \xa0Those were the impressionable years when I discovered who I was, what I wanted out of life, and, though majoring in Global Studies did not necessarily help me figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up, I learned exactly what I did NOT want to be (a greedy “bad guy” who ruins the ecosystem), and that had value enough for me.''So, when I visit, I want to maximize my time there. \xa0If you’re the same way, here’s a list of awesome things to do in Santa Barbara:''The Best Beaches''Best for surfing:''Mesa Lane Beach: you will have to walk down the stairs between the private homes to get to Mesa Lane Beach, but the beach itself is completely public. Checking the tide schedule beforehand is important as the beach could completely disappear during high tide.''El Capitan Beach'': when the waves are right, this beach offers incredible breaks for advanced surfers. El Capitan could be crowded at times, but it’s worth going as the wave has the potential to \xa0break for hundreds of yards.''Best for swimming:''Butterfly Beach: This pretty beach regularly makes it into top California beach lists , with good reason. It’s easy to access from the Four Seasons Biltmore, the gentle waves are perfect for swimming, and the beach offers some of the best spots for sunset watching in Santa Barbara. There are no public facilities on the beach, so bring your own lunch and have a nice picnic afternoon.''Summerland Beach: Summerland Beach is located below the Lookout Park. It is usually not crowded, and the waves are great for swimming. It is also a dog-friendly beach, which is always a plus in my book.''Can’t complain''Best for diving and snorkeling:''Refugio Beach: Diving and snorkeling are pleasant at Refugio, with easy shore access and complete showers and toilet facilities on the beach. On the beach itself, Refugio is also great for picnics.''Best for your dog:''Hendry’s Beach: Also known as the Arroyo Burro Beach, is an awesome place to bring your dog. Dogs are free to roam wild here at the off-leash legal area, which is only about 100 feet from the main beach. People are friendly, dogs are happy, such a great place with great atmosphere!''Best for lounging and chilling:''Hammond’s Beach: If you plan on just chilling on the sand, then go to Hammond Beach. It is a little bit tricky to get to (''here’s detailed directions''), but definitely worth the effort. Hammond is more of a locals beach, which makes it perfect for an afternoon date with a book.''What a show off?!''Go Hiking''Red Rock:''(''The road to Red Rocks is currently closed due to storms'', so make sure to check if it’s still closed before going!)''There are many awesome hikes in Santa Barbara and the surrounding areas, with natural rock water slides and waterfalls, but Red Rock in particular is a popular hike and hangout spot, especially on summer weekends. \xa0To successfully spend a day there, follow these''directions to the trailhead'', pack supplies you intend to carry back out with you (no littering, please!), like plenty of water, snacks, proper footwear for hiking, and a bathing suit for swimming in the Santa Ynez River.''It’s a nice change of pace from a typical beach day, and gives you an opportunity to have a “local’s” experience. \xa0If you go on a weekend in the spring/summer, you’ll probably be partying with college students. \xa0If you go any other time of year, however, you just might have a more laid-back day.''Lastly, if you really just''really''want to get an adrenaline rush that may or may not end successfully, take a jump from the 40-foot cliffs into the pools below. Would I? Heck no, but it IS what Red Rock is sorta known for.''By C O L I N''Inspiration Point:''This moderately challenging trail is one of the most popular hiking trails in Santa Barbara. There are a few routes available to get to the amazing views about 1800 feet above Santa Barbara. The longer (about 8 mile round trip) Jesuita Trail offers ocean view on your way up, whereas the shorter (about 4 mile round trip) Tunnel Trail is dog friendly, and it is popular with local trailers as well as mountain bikers.''Montecito Peak:''If you are up for a challenge, Montecito Peak is for you. It is one of the highest in the Santa Ynez range, standing tall at over 3000 feet. Getting to Montecito Peak is accessed by walking a \xa07.1 mile round trip trail, and has close to a 2500 feet elevation gain. However, the oceanic view as you make your way up will keep you motivated.''Start your hike at the Cold Springs Trail, and continue straight up when you reach the West Frog Trail junction, shortly after which you would have a few creek-crossings to do. Then, after a few more unmarked junctions and single tracks, you will be rewarded with an amazing 360 degree view at the very top. (''details here'')''If you prefer a less demanding hike, check out Tangerine Falls and/or Seven Falls which are 2.5 miles round-trip. Seven falls, when filled with water, is a great spot for swimming. Be sure to watch out for poison oak on your way to the Tangerine Falls, and all of the hikes on this list, for that matter.''Rocky Pine Ridge:''If you are short on time but still want a good workout,''Rocky Pine Ridge''is perfect. It is a short hike up, but you will have some boulder hopping to do. Additionally, there are some misleading rock formations to keep you on your toes. However, if you are fit and confident with navigation, it is a great hike that offers magnificent views of the rocks. The trailhead is tricky to find, beginning''at the junction of Gibralter Rd and East Camino Cielo Rd''.''Other activities''Wine tasting:''Urban Wine Trail offers close to 30 wineries and cellars around downtown Santa Barbara, completed with an app and a map that helps you navigate your way through based on your wine preferences. There are also live music and other events going on at different tasting rooms on a weekly basis, so''check their event calendar''and plan your wine tasting trip accordingly.''Shopping:''Most people head to State Street, which is filled with boutiques, cafes, and restaurants. But if you are shopping for something more unique, check out the Funk Zone (where the Urban Wine Trail is located, too). Expect to find hip and trendy boutiques dotted along the street, selling thrifted treasures and unique Santa Barbara souvenirs. There are also many galleries and restaurants, so the best way to spend your time at the Funk Zone is to start by some gallery hopping, continue with a nice weekend brunch at one of the cool, new restaurants, and shop your heart out afterwards. It is also a great spot for partying after the sun goes down.''Visit the gardens:''Created by a Polish opera singer and socialite, Madame Ganna Walska back in the 40s,''Ganna Walska Lotusland''is now one of the 10 best gardens in the world, according to The Telegraph. The entire area is beautifully manicured with, well, lotus flowers, as well as other interesting botanics such as the Japanese garden, succulent garden, and more. Another iconic botanical garden is the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden – such a pretty place to take photos, to see the tallest trees in the world, and very often you will see weddings being held at the garden.''I mean, you don’t even have to work that hard to be a brilliant photographer here. \xa0The landscape just poses for you:''Santa Barbara Botanical Gardens''Explore Santa Barbara’s Spanish History:''Mission Santa Barbara''&''El Presidio Historic Park''are two places that will \xa0refresh your early California history class memories.

It opens daily, and offers docent tours on every Tuesday – Friday at 11am, and every Saturday at 10:30am. El Presidio Historic Park is the birthplace of Santa Barbara, and while most of the fort has been rebuilt, the El Cuarte and the \xa0Canedo Adobe are still intact. If you can’t get enough of the Spanish architecture, check out the Santa Barbara Court House too!''The view from Mission Santa Barbara''Channel Islands National Park:''This national park is made up of 5 remote islands, namely San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and Santa Barbara. There are various boat tours leaving for Channel Islands National Park from Ventura and Oxnard on a daily basis. Both''Truth Aquatics''and''Island Packers''offer day trips as well as longer excursions to the national park. Depending on the time of the year, and a little bit of luck, you could see whales and dolphins frolicking in their habitat. Once you are on the islands, you will also see channel island foxes, a once endangered specie. Other activities include kayaking, camping, and hiking.''Channel Islands National Park''A few things to note if you are planning on camping – a permit is required, and and in order to get it you must have your ferry tickets booked. The remote islands also do not offer food concessions, so bring your own food from the mainland! Lastly, you should practice pack-in, pack-out, as always when camping without services. Overall, Channel Islands is perfect for those who looking to unplug and rewind.''Check out the Farmers Market:''That happens weekly, every single week of the year!

This was in fact music to our ears as we are regular fall goers (if anyone hasn’t already checked our''YouTube vlogs''where you can find such adventures) and often find ourselves searching and bathing in the majesty of such phenomenon.

Indeed, it is an exciting thought of sighting a wild elephant that approaches on occasion, as announced by the brightly coloured elephant crossing signs dotting the main roads.''As our vehicle climbed a steep hill, the first sight of the waterfall came into view on the horizon. A slither of crystal white water slicing the adjacent shades of greenery. We were informed by our driver that the waterfall is in fact over 300m high and if you were to trek to the top of the falls for a birds eye view of the formation and what must be a visually stunning panoramic view of the Al-Muktafibilah province, one must tackle the 9 hour climb to the top. If only we had brought our camping gear and made a night of it! Alas, time waits for no man and we were more than happy to venture the mere 2 hour trek through the jungle to reach the base of the falls.''Arriving at Chemerung Amenity Forest, the starting point of our trek through the jungle, we geared up and threw our packs on our backs.''Trekking through the array of bright green jungle landscape, we waded through the wilderness as we crossed streams, scaled rocks and ducked overhangs of the dense forest. Well and truly away from the beaten path and deep into jungle territory, we admired bewildering shaped trees, eyed (not tried) mushrooms of all sizes and attempted to glance the rare sight of wild boar that are known to roam the forest.''The trail starts out with a clear path that fades dramatically the further you venture, though do keep a close eye to the ground as well as the landscape to guide your way. If you feel you have veered to far from the route, then stick to the trail bending around the river and you will definitely find your way.

I was also blown away by some of her answers to my questions and her adventurous spirit. Without further ado, meet Wangechi:''Who are you?''Wangechi in India''My name is Wangechi Gitahi, a young lady born and raised in Nairobi – Kenya, and one who also identifies as a citizen of the world. I am a very ambitious lady who is focused, strong willed, courageous, daring and I will sometimes go against the gradient to achieve my goals. I am very passionate about travel, children, community development, cultures, people, the great outdoors as well as being adventurous. I am a marketer by profession and a traveler by passion who mainly identifies as a solo-female backpacker. I run my own''travel blog''and''social media platforms''where I get to share my amazing travel adventures with the goal of exposing the world to the world, and break stereotypes of places and people via sharing my honest experiences as well as inspiring more people to actually venture out and travel.''What was the moment when you realized you were going to travel solo no matter what?''A few years back, a couple of my friends and I planned to visit the famous Maasai Mara National Park in Kenya. It is famous for its vast array of wild life as well as being home to the Seventh Wonder of the World-The Wildebeest migration. This is when millions of Wildebeests cross from the''Serengeti in Tanzania''into Kenya and cross the dangerous crocodile infested Mara river annually. The view has been hailed as epic and I could not wait to see/experience it for myself.''However, as the day drew closer, people pulled out, the social conversations on it went silent and soon it was cancelled. I was disappointed that I wouldn’t go to the Maasai Mara, I wouldn’t see the Wildebeest Migration and all the wildlife there, and I wouldn’t get to camp – things I was really looking forward to doing. At that moment, I realized that I was disappointed at the prospect of not fulfilling a dream of mine and not so much that I wouldn’t be hanging out with my friends. I called the travel agent we were to use, I confirmed my booking, accepted to join an unknown group and went ahead to pay and travel to the Maasai Mara. Suffice to say, the trip was a great experience, I made new friends on the trip, I saw many wildlife over and above the wildebeest and I returned home with a new fire awakened-I would be traveling for “me” not “us”, and thus solo travel was born and has been growing since.''What misconceptions did you have about solo travel that you now realize were untrue?''I grew up believing that beyond my family and some friends, the world was a very dangerous place and even more so for a female. I thought solo travelers were really wealthy people, rebels of sort, extreme extroverts and perhaps lied when they said the trips were epic and not dangerous. I have come to learn that humanity is dominantly made up of good, honest, warm people willing to assist a stranger and only a few people are bad. I have learnt to follow my intuition and talk to strangers (when my intuition doesn’t sound sirens) because as a solo traveler-you are forced to rely on strangers for many things and thus even''introverts learn to break free of their shell''. I have learnt that most solo travelers are not rebels and are actually the politest of people. In regard to finances, they are dominantly the most frugal of people.''Can you tell me a story about when you were traveling solo that was so mind blowing amazing that you still smile when you think about it?''I once received a query from a reader of my blog asking if it was safe for a female to travel solo in Kenya. I couldn’t honestly respond to it as I had never actually travelled or backpacked solo in Kenya. I felt challenged and thus decided to backpack solo to the most remote place in Kenya-Northern Kenya. This area is dominantly dry, has little to no development and suffers violent community clashes. My rationale was –if a trip to the harshest area was successful, then it would be a great gauge for the rest of Kenya.''I thus opted to backpack overland from Nairobi to Loiyangalani –home of Lake Turkana which is the largest permanent desert lake and the world’s largest alkaline lake, 554km away. I was terrified as I left Nairobi, the “what ifs” flooded my mind with the main fears being the deadly community clashes that occur in the region and the lack of information on how to actually get there. This trip took about a week and a half and saw me live and experience cultural integration in Suguta Marmar and Baragoi in Samburu County-areas dominated by the Samburu and Turkana communities respectively. It was amazing learning in-depth about their culture, making new friends, enjoying the amazing scenery and learning how to deal with heat-the sun was showing off. Along the way we met many young men armed with guns – I cannot adequately express the fear that gripped me at those times – but all they did was wave at us as they continued to graze their cattle. Baragoi is the last stop for public vehicles and from there, I would have to navigate blindly as there was no more information.''Once there, it took several days before the locals were comfortable enough to share information on how I would then progress. They are very wary of strangers and couldn’t comprehend why a “town girl”, not a native of any of the tribes in the region, would want to travel that harsh terrain by herself. I was informed that I would have to hitch-hike a truck which would be ferrying goods to the Lake region and it took five days before it arrived. I had never hitch-hiked, I had said I would never hitch-hike, but there I was earnestly negotiating with the driver to kindly allow me to ride on the lorry. That is how I found myself –a town girl, sitting atop a truck “lorry” for over 12 hours as that was the only available spot at the back of the truck. I experienced forced sun basking in the sweltering heat, I was covered in sand as the terrain is bare and I learnt to sit still and balance at the top. However, the amazing scenery of rocks, hills, valleys, pastoralist homesteads “manyattas” and the entertaining friends hitch-hiking as well made the journey bearable. The icing on the cake was when we finally got to sight Lake Turkana as the sun was setting. The entrancing and enchanting sight of the sun set, the light glimmering on the lake and the sense of accomplishment is priceless. I could now honestly claim that yes, it is safe for a female to travel safely in Kenya.''How did Be My Travel Muse help you?''Solo female backpacking in Africa''is not the norm, let alone Kenya, and thus I am deemed to be a peculiar individual. I hardly have anyone to trade ideas with or engage with in this regard. When I stumbled across Be my Travel Muse blog a while back, I was excited to finally “meet” someone like me. The more I read your stories the more I saw similarities especially when it came to travelling the unbeaten paths. It was great to finally interact even though virtually with a likeminded individual. As I planned some trips, I would review some of the\xa0articles to get insights and I hope that one day I can grow my blog to great heights, like this one, that would enable me to travel long term whilst''making money from the blog''.''What are some unexpected benefits of traveling alone?''I have grown physically, mentally and spiritually. It has taught me to be more independent, more self-reliant, more trusting of people and more open to the diversity in people. I have discovered willpower that I never knew I had before, I have learnt that its Ok to be afraid, to ask for help and to dare to make my dreams a reality. Last but not least I have made amazing lifelong friendships and grown in my faith.''How do you make it financially sustainable?''I currently work full time thus I save, save, save throughout the year. I have put a personal bare minimum requirement to travel at least one foreign country per year and locally as much as possible.''I am trying to grow my travel brand''wangechigitahitravels''to leaps and bounds so that I can generate income from it that will allow me to live comfortably and perhaps travel full time.''***''Thanks so much, Wangechi, for sharing your story!''For past stories, check out''Archana from India'',''Thia from Indonesia'',''Courtney the traveling stylist'', and''Julie who travels solo in her 50s''!''Have a story to share?''Get in touch!''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Solo Female Travel Stories: Becky a Fearless Solo Mom''Solo Female Travel Stories: Roberta from Italy''Solo Female Travel Stories – See, a Hitchhiker from Malaysia''Day 215''Upon my departure from Thailand after a combined three glorious months, the familiar mixture of unease and excitement that accompanies landing in a new country came over me. \xa0I knew almost nothing about Malaysia, and wasn’t sure what to expect, especially after becoming so comfortable in Thailand.''So comfortable, in fact, that I am still converting Malaysian Ringgit to Thai Baht in my head rather than directly to US Dollars.''Imagine my excitement to find that, just like my first unfamiliar days in''Bangkok'', I’d have someone to guide me through –''James Clark''. \xa0I absolutely love it when I arrive in a town and find out that James happens to be around. \xa0This means several things: he will know where all the best food is, will be able to suggest a great coffee shop, will know where to find the best WiFi, and will already have local transportation figured out.''In short, I can be extremely lazy about doing research or planning of any kind, which is my favorite.''I asked him what the best thing to do in Penang was (other than stuffing my face with amazing food at every possible interval), and he suggested Kek Lok Si – the largest Buddhist temple in the whole of Southeast Asia. \xa0Given that I don’t seem to suffer the common traveler ailment of being “templed out”, even after the amazingness of''Angkor Wat'',''Sukhothai'', and the''White Temple'', I was excited to see what Kek Lok Si had on offer.''I was not disappointed:''*Photos are in order of how one would see these sights walking through the temple''Once upon a time, during my Taiwan days, I could have read this!''So intricate and colorful''There are 10,000 buddhas within Kek Lok Si temple''So bright and blue''Beautiful scenes on the ceiling''Prayer Ribbons''James and I elected to pick out some prayer ribbons.

Actual travel time will be much longer on buses, motorbikes, and trains, but this can give you a sense of distances:''Transport tips:''Getting in:''Vietnam requires that most tourists have a visa.

You can also buy a visa online\xa0(I used''myvietnamvisa.com''), print the approval letter, bring along passport sized photos, and\xa0pay a $45 stamping fee when you arrive.

They are also easier to book on short notice than the train during lunar new year''Trains:\xa0This is the most popular method for getting around Vietnam and\xa0also quite comfortable, but it’s important to book in advance during holidays like Lunar New Year.''Motorbike: It’s also popular to buy a motorbike and take it from top to the bottom of Vietnam, or vice versa. The upsides are, of course, the adventure and the freedom. It’s impossible to imagine coming out of an experience like that without more than a few good stories. However you can also plan on hanging out at the mechanic, spending a lot of time in Vietnam, and potentially crashing. Sometimes people give up and saw their bikes partway through, so you might get lucky and be able to buy a bike in Hoi An.''Taxis: In cities, taxis are a good option if and only if you take the right companies. To avoid scams, always insist on the meter, including to and from the airport, and take a Vinasun or Mai Linh taxi. Those two companies do not rig the meter nor scam tourists. The others\xa0often do!''Vietnam is an adventure, and it can be a ton of fun and delicious too.

It isn’t about being the youngest, either. Hiking is about endurance, and much of endurance is mental.''Stay positive with your inner dialogue. Don’t say things like ‘can’t’ or ‘won’t’ to yourself.

So I’ve ranked Cuba’s best food, so you can explore the local flavors on your next trip to this Caribbean nation.''8. Vaca Frita''It’s simple, but it’s popular — and for good reason. Shredded beef is marinated in lime juice, garlic, salt and pepper before being flash-fried until crispy. The citrus creates a lift that keeps this from feeling as heavy as other Cuban dishes — but it’s still a plate of meat, so be prepared for that. When''vaca frita''is done right, it strikes a texture balance between tender cooked beef and crispy, flash-fried edges that lend it perfect amount of crunch.''7. Lechon Asado''A whole-roasted pig is one of the most universal dishes I’ve come across in my travels, and Cuba was no exception. The Cubans marinate their pork in''mojo,''a concoction of sour orange, garlic, and a couple of earthy spices. The pork sits in this bathtub of flavor for at least half a day, then it’s grilled over low heat for almost as long as it marinated. It’s a long-haul meal, and it takes at least a day to cook. But in the end, you get tender, juicy pork and crispy-crackling skin that is''so''worth the wait.''6. Cuban Coffee''Cuba may be most famous for their cigars, but if you asked me I’d say their coffee should be at the top of the list of coveted, borderline-illegal exports. They grow a''strong''brew in Cuba. To counteract the intensity of their espresso beans, traditional Cuban coffee is brewed with raw sugar, creating a sweet and strong beverage that’s served in a tiny mug and sends a jolt through your morning.''Cafe con leche''and a smaller''cortadita''are also coffee drinks you’ll find in Cuba, though they tend to be favored by locals as a post-dinner dessert accompaniment.''5. Lobster – Any Way You Like It''I debated whether or not I should include lobster on this list, for one major reason. In Cuba, it’s illegal for citizens to fish for lobster for personal consumption. Like all agriculture and industry in Cuba, lobster fishing is run entirely by the government and any catch is rationed (just like all other food in the country). Thus, it is a delicacy that is reserved primarily for visitors and tourists. But because it is native to the Caribbean Sea that surrounds the beautiful country of Cuba, I decided to leave it on the list. Most''paladars''prepare lobster beautifully, but do a little research to make sure you’re going to a restaurant that will make it worth the pesos — you’ll be hard-pressed to spend less than $20 CUC on a lobster dinner. Though, compared to US prices, this is a bargain!''4. Picadillo''Many Cubans will call this the truest taste of Cuba. At it’s core, it is a ground beef and tomato stew, and it’s a (very hearty) sweet-savory treat found on lunch and dinner menus all over the country. Each recipe is unique, so if you’re lucky enough to be invited into a Cuban home for a meal, you’ll get the secret family recipe. No matter where you try this dish, a few things are always included: lots of seasoned ground beef, tomatoes (fresh or canned is a hotly-debated topic), salty olives and sweet raisins. It won’t hit''all''the corners of your palate, but it will deliver a full belly with plenty of flavor.''3. Arroz con Pollo''This dish is Cuba’s answer to paella. It diverges from its Spanish roots with a healthy dose of beer and a little white wine. In Cuba, saffron is swapped for annato, which gives the rice it’s signature yellow hue and a distinct earthy, peppery taste that makes this 100% Caribbean. Nestled into this bed of heavily seasoned, deliciously stewed rice are generous helpings of bone-in chicken, braised in all that delicious liquid and practically falling off the bone. A few chopped asparagus, onion, and bell peppers are scattered into the rice, but they are decidedly not the stars of this show. Chow down and enjoy.''2. Cubano''This is likely Cuba’s most famous export — the ham and pork sandwich to end all ham sandwiches. There’s a reason whole movies have been made about this sandwich. In Cuba, bread is made with lard (because go big or go home). With this dense and flavorful bread as your base, pile on sliced ham, roasted pork, loads of pickles, onion, and tomato, then toast the whole thing until the mayo and mustard is dripping down the sides and the cheese achieves melty perfection. The result is a hearty, savory mouthpunch that will have you wolfing down that sandwich like a starving person.''1. Ropa Vieja''Like many Cuban dishes,''ropa vieja''starts with''sofrito'', a hearty mix of bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spices that form the foundation of flavor. Onto this base, flank steak is slow cooked until it falls apart — not an easy task for such a low-fat cut of beef. By the time the stewing is complete, you’ll have a dish full hearty, meaty goodness. Many call this dish — which translates to ‘old clothes’ in English — the national dish of Cuba. And if you find a''paladar''that does it right, you’ll never want to stop eating. As such, I’m giving it #1 status on my ranking of Cuban dishes. Good luck cleaning your plate!''Recipe: Arroz con Pollo''Ingredients''3 Tbsp olive oil''1 whole chicken, cut into eight pieces''1 medium yellow onion, chopped''1 medium red bell pepper, chopped''5 cloves of garlic, minced''1/2 lb. asparagus, cut into bite-sized pieces''3 cups of Valencian Rice''1 Tbsp white wine vinegar''1 bottle Amber beer (such as Dos Equis)''4 cups chicken broth, plus more if needed''1 cup dry white wine''1 8-oz can tomato sauce''1 4-oz jar of pimentos, juice reserved''For the Spice Mix''1 tsp salt''1 tsp freshly-cracked black pepper''1 tsp cumin''1 tsp dried oregano''1/2 tsp Bijol''1/2 tsp cayenne''1 bay leaf''Instructions''Heat oil in a cast-iron or heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and cumin, then sear on the pan for about 6 minutes, or until it starts to release it’s juices. Remove and set aside.''In the same pan, sautee the onion, pepper, garlic and asparagus until they just start to soften. Add the spice mix and stir to coat vegetables. Sautee for one minute more, then add the chicken back into the pan. Stir to coat the chicken with the spice mix.''Add in the rice and toss to coat. Allow it to toast in the spices and chicken for 1 – 2 mintues, then add half of the beer, chicken stock, and white wine. Turn up the heat to bring the mixture to boil, adding more liquid to keep the rice wet if needed. Lower heat to a simmer.''As the rice cooks and the liquid burns off, continue adding more beer, wine, and chicken stock to keep a layer of liquid on the bottom of the skillet at all times. Incorporate the pimento juice as well.''Simmer for about 30 minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed by the rice but it is still wet.''Stir in the pimentos and serve!''Note: you can garnish this with green olives, capers, or chopped chilies for a spicy kick!''About the Author:''“Jetsetter” Jenn Brown is an adventurer, amateur chef, and wine-lover who has been on the move since 2012.

I also appreciate that it’s closer to Bangkok than the beaches in the south, making this a great option if you’re short on time.''South Islands and beaches''Tonsai Beach''Most people who go to Thailand are doing so to visit the beautiful islands in the South. They are more touristy and expensive than the north, but it’s still a budget destination, so you can spend way less than you would in Europe or the US, for example.''I have noted which places tend to be more popular and which tend to be a bit quieter and less trafficked. Both are great depending on what you seek at the time:''If you like it quiet:''Railay Beach by''ExpertVagabond''Tonsai''Tonsai sits right next to the more famous Railay beach but IMHO, it’s way better. It’s full of slack-liners and rock climbers and even base jumpers. If you want to give those\xa0sports a try, this is the spot.''Tonsai is more relaxed and has less of a resort feel than Railay, and the best part is you can easily access one place from the other by foot or a 5-minute longtail boat. Maybe you could even swim! I haven’t tried it. It’s worth it to stop by Railay to''check out the lagoon'', if you’re cool with the climb.''Koh Yao Noi''This Island is sometimes called the non-farang island to due to the lack of tourists.

The island is pretty big, and some parts of it have nothing to do with the full moon party madness.''Bottle beach''is peaceful, laid-back, and only reachable by boat or down a long 4×4 road.

However it is still an experience\xa0– I went for my 27th birthday and had a great time!''You can stay on other parts of the island without having to be right in the party zone in Haad Rin. In fact I would recommend this, because this island has some really beautiful beaches and nicer places to stay than the epicenter of the full moon party. If you would rather not book ahead, you can show up and look for accommodation on the ground without having to book an obligatory five nights together.''Phuket''Phuket is huge, and this is where you can find debauchery or fancy resorts with their own beaches. Maybe it used to be cool, but I personally do not think there’s any reason to give Phuket any time. I have stayed there a few times in transit but it tends to feel incredibly westernized and I would rather feel like I’m in Thailand, not back home.

It’s somewhat close to the cruise port and the airport in Oranjestad.''In order to access the island you have two options: You can stay at the Renaissance Hotel since it’s included as a hotel perk, or you can pay a $99 fee for access to the island for the day. It includes the boat transfer, lunch on the island, and a drink.''Hello buddy!''There is, however, a caveat. The hotel sells a maximum of 30 passes to the island per day to non-guests, so it is possible that you could arrive at the hotel and find that they are sold out.''That said, the hotel can cost as low as $150 per night and it has a pretty awesome pool as well, so I would suggest staying there for a night if seeing the flamingos is really high on your list of must-dos in Aruba.''It was pretty cool''You can also call the hotel ahead of time to make sure they still have passes before you head over. If they turn you down at the lobby, remind them that you called ahead, and they still may sell you a ticket – it worked for a couple of friends of mine.''What Renaissance Island is like''The island itself is absolutely stunning. You access it from a tiny little porch area next to the Starbucks on the floor below the lobby in the Renaissance Hotel. The speed boat runs every 10 to 15 minutes and, reminiscent of Las Vegas, takes you under the lobby of the hotel before heading right out into the ocean.''The gorgeous island''After about 15 minutes you arrive at the island which has been carefully crafted into a dreamy Caribbean getaway with hammocks, swaying palm trees, and of course, a little group of flamingos.''The island is divided into two sides – the adult side and the family side. The flamingos are actually located on the adult side, so do expect to see some children coming over to see them from time to time.''This is the ‘adult’ side''There are also little huts on one of the rocky peninsulas that you can rent out for the day, which we did since my time in Aruba fell on the birthday of two of my friends and I. So we had to, right?''Each one has a hammock over the water, and the end one that we rented had a swing as well. Sadly, drinks are not included so this is purely for the privilege of having a private area on the island.''Is Flamingo Island worth it?''Bikini top by''Lolli Swim''I had a wonderful time on the island, all in all. I thought it was absolutely beautiful, relaxed, and of course I enjoyed a little romp in the warm water with the flamingos.''That said, I think that $99 is really steep. There are only about seven flamingos and everybody wants to take photos with them. They are not native to the island, so I think of it more as a petting zoo than anything else. You should also know that the only shade on the island is palm trees unless you seek refuge in the bar area or are one of the lucky few who rent a Bungalow. For me, that means I could not hang out on the island all day because I don’t want to be in the sun for that many hours.''No real shade anywhere''I do think that the''Renaissance Aruba Resort''is a lovely option, however the only beach they have is the Renaissance Island, so there’s no strolling out of your room and right onto the sand like if you stayed in Palm Beach, which I personally did.''This is Palm Beach –''bikini by Indah''The best of both worlds, if you have the time, would be to spend a couple days at the Renaissance and a few days elsewhere that has more of a beachy feel.''Pin me!''Thanks, Aruba, for giving me a taste of the Caribbean.

Walk down the stairs and viola, you’ve arrived.''The lounge is classy and perfect for a romantic date, but do be warned that food and drinks are pricey. Here’s a piece of advice: The price of ramen is cheaper at Uma Uma Restaurant than at The Horses’ Mouth.

It’s totally crazy.''People will tell you that your 30s are the best decade and you will roll your eyes because it is unimaginable to you that anything could be better than your 20s, standing in a crowded bar with a sticky floor and dancing to horrible ’00s top 40 music.''To be honest, your 20s were pretty cool but you spent a lot of them insecure and unsure of yourself. A lot of what I will say will be difficult to hear, and I know you hate nothing more than to be told what to do, but for once, maybe you should sit yourself down and listen.''These are 31 little things that you learned in the last 10 years:''1. I know that right now, the most exciting thing ever is that you can finally get into bars without a fake ID, but in about 10 years that is the last place that you will feel like being. Partying, contrary to popular music and television, does not make you cool and it’s not that exciting. In reality you just want to escape responsibility and use it as a band-aid solution for doing some real growth work. It’ll be painful when you finally do grow up and realize how much time you wasted on being wasted.''2. You’re scared of getting older. Each and every birthday after this one you will probably freak out about getting on in age, and each and every year you will remember that you freaked out before and how silly that was because you were so much younger back then.''This is where you’ll celebrate turning 31. Not too shabby!''3. Please stop comparing yourself to others. Delete Facebook now, it’s a sinking ship of your youth and time. Life is not selfies and manufactured perfection.''4. It is totally OK that you don’t get married or have kids in the next 10 years. You are also going to''quit your fancy corporate job''and buy a one-way ticket to Bangkok to\xa0pursue your dream of being a writer.\xa0People will think you’re crazy and in truth, you''are''kind of crazy.''5. Which brings me to, please don’t stress about not having everything figured out. The truth is you never will, but you will get better at accepting it in time.''6. The greatest skills you will acquire over the next 10 years are recognizing the power of honesty, the importance of compassion, and the incredible skill of patience. To be honest, that last one is still something you struggle with!''7. As the world gets bigger to you, you will realize how small you are within it and how little anything you do really matters. You are an imperceptible grain of sand in millennia and millennia in a universe greater than anyone can imagine. So stop worrying so much that you’ll make a mistake, because it’s not as big of a deal as you think.''8. You’re going to spend a lot of time alone, which right now probably sounds terrible but it will be''exactly what you need''.''9. You will hear the 20-something motto, ‘live life with no regrets because everything you did was exactly what you wanted.’ This is really just a way of making excuses for behaving badly. It is impossible to live a life without regrets. Even the freaking Dalai Lama has regrets. To err is to be human, but own up to what you do.''10.

Whenever something goes wrong, ask yourself what you did to cause it, be honest in your answer, and make a change.''18. But be gentle with yourself, because change will come much more quickly if you are a lot kinder with your inner dialogue.''19. Question absolutely everything.

Not everybody is going to like you, understand you, or respect you. If you have haters and trolls just for being you then it means you’re doing something right.

You’d be hard pushed to find a social media feed that doesn’t feature the beautiful White Beach of Boracay, sparkling lagoons of Coron or the vibrant town of El Nido.''The island of Cebu is another destination that finds itself on most peoples Philippines itinerary with many venturing to the island to tick some of the most unbelievable experiences off their bucket list and this island certainly didn’t disappoint. Travelling to the southern tip of Cebu, we were able to swim with the beautiful and majestic whale sharks in Oslob (''check out our unbelievable video here''). As we slipped into the water, nothing could have prepared us for the feeling that we would experience as we dipped our heads below the waters surface. The enormous sea creatures elegantly swam beneath us, their colossal tails gently swiping the water. We watched as their polka dot bodies glided past us, each pattern unique but all equally as beautiful as the next. It wasn’t until we dove deeper to the depths that the sheer size of these gentle giants was fully appreciated. Swimming alongside them, we were truly dwarfed in their incredible shadows.''As we headed back to the shore, we weren’t surprised to see more and more tourists stepping out of their vans, all also eager to catch a glimpse of the whale sharks. With the famous Kawasan Falls only an hour away, we were craving an adventure a little more off the beaten path.''To the north of Cebu lies the peaceful Bantayan Island. Almost unheard of by backpackers, it still remains largely untouched by tourism making it the perfect destination for those yearning a more authentic Philippino experience. Although it’s relatively unheard of, getting to the island is very simple.''Bantayan Island''Although there are several small islands to the North of Cebu, it was no coincidence that Bantayan Island was at the top of our list. We spent several lazy days exploring the beautiful island and we couldn’t help but be drawn to its amazing powder beaches. Kota Beach is truly a slice of heaven with its whiter than white sandbar slicing through the Gatorade coloured sea. Several lazy days were spent admiring this portion of paradise. As our toes sank into the sand and the sun beat down on us, we watched the wooden fishing boats cruise by and the local children play with one another on the beach, living that enviable island life.''Heading away from the beaches we rented a couple of push bikes for 150pesos each and took to the road to explore some more of the island. As we cruised along the bumpy roads, we quickly realised that the locals were without doubt the friendliest people we had met on our travels to date. Waving as we went, we made several mandatory pit stops to quench our thirst in the make shift huts at the roadside. As we sank several Bintang, we watched Philippino life unfold around us.''Enveloped in the island life, we stopped only a little way down the road for Charlie to have his hair cut in the coolest barber shop on the planet. With an audience of nine year old boys that expanded by the minute, it was obvious that this hairdresser’s wasn’t usually a place where foreigners opt to get their hair cut, but for 50pesos it was undoubtedly the cheapest place Charlie would ever get a new do! Showing the hairdresser an image of the style he wanted, we were both in fits of laughter as he came out with a Mohican and a square shave at the back, nothing like the picture he had shown, yet still, the barber was clearly pleased with his work!''But not only is the island home to some of the best beaches in the Philippines (''check out our drone footage if you don’t believe us''); it also has another secret to coax travellers away from the main islands … Skydive Greater Cebu!

Having met with our instructors and given a thorough briefing, we were kitted up and in the plane before we knew it. As we climbed to 10,000ft, I couldn’t help but gaze out of the window at the bright turquoise seas that surrounded the island. We could see for miles! Spotting the roads we had ridden on our bikes only the day before, it all felt very surreal, until Brad opened the door that was! With the wind surging in through the open plane door, my heart was racing like it had never raced before and reality set in. Shifting towards the door I questioned what on earth I was doing … 3, 2, 1, GO!''Hurtling out of the plane, we careered down towards the earth! The sensation was like nothing I have ever felt before. Whizzing through the clouds my racing heart was now full of excitement as adrenaline cursed through my veins! The islands below getting closer by the second, I didn’t want this to end! As the parachute was drawn I looked up to see Charlie plummeting through the sky. Bantayan looked even more beautiful from above.

This is yet another example of an amazing adventurer, Archana, who decided that even though her culture doesn’t necessarily encourage women traveling on their own, she was going to break out of the mold and do it anyway.''In her words, this is Archana’s story:''Archana in Ladakh, India''Who are you?''I am Archana. I was\xa0born and brought up in India, and then moved to the United States for\xa0graduate\xa0school where I continued to\xa0live for\xa0about one-third of my life,\xa0before deciding\xa0to give up on the ever\xa0elusive\xa0American dream. So I downsized my life to a\xa0minimum by getting rid of all of my\xa0material possessions, packing whatever\xa0little I deemed\xa0important and made the big move back to the Eastern Hemisphere to pursue a\xa0nomadic lifestyle.''I have been\xa0known, by my inner circle, to be the kind of person who\xa0constantly strives to break the\xa0stereotypes that are always trying to\xa0define\xa0and confine me\xa0within the parameters of being\xa0a\xa0woman+''millennial''+''immigrant+successful. I thoroughly\xa0enjoy\xa0fighting to take\xa0full control on what these parameters mean\xa0instead of\xa0letting the larger society define them for me.\xa0Giving up on a successful corporate career to\xa0embark on an indefinite\xa0backpacking journey has been quite\xa0instrumental in\xa0redefining my boundaries.''What was the moment when you realized you were going to travel solo no matter what?''It was in 2013 when my salary had finally pushed me up to be debt-free. I took a deep breath and embraced the good feeling of complete financial independence. But in a couple of days, my restless mind started to question the lifestyle choices that were primarily being defined by the corporate job that I held at that time. I started to wonder the real purpose of doing the job that I wasn’t highly passionate about. As an avid reader, that’s when I stumbled upon few blogs, BeMyTravelMuse being one of those, of full time travelers. I immediately felt connected to the ideas of indefinite travel, nomadic lifestyle and the sense of freedom that comes with lack of burdensome possessions and following one’s own crazy schedule.''I had decided that that’s what I wanted to do next. That decision also answered my questions about the sense of purpose that I was looking for to continue doing the corporate job. And so I worked diligently on a savings plan over the next 2 years with a simple and focused goal. In all of this time of planning and prepping, it had simply never occurred to me to include anyone else in this journey. It was my dream, I was working towards fulfilling it and I was about to make it happen. So the plan for traveling solo developed in a very organic manner for the kind of person that I am.''What misconceptions did you have about solo travel that you now realize were untrue?''In Masai Mara, Kenya''I was told that I am leaving what is familiar – my friends, my\xa0comforts, a secure job – for something that may not be the best for me. I was told that it would be nothing but a long, lonely and uncertain\xa0path\xa0ahead\xa0of me.\xa0I admit that I\xa0had my own fleeting doubts about all those\xa0aspects\xa0before I started my journey. But each one\xa0of them got\xa0smashed sooner\xa0than later.''It’s exhilarating\xa0to see that the world is so much safer, kinder and more comfortable than what it is made out to be. Making friends, the kinds of people that my previously\xa0definitive lifestyle would have never given me a chance to cross paths with, has been the highlight of my journey. Confronting and challenging\xa0my own ideas of comforts, wants and needs\xa0and ultimately deciding what kind\xa0of lifestyle I would design for myself\xa0going forward and\xa0how much I need in order\xa0to\xa0really\xa0be happy, is the sort of learning that I have and still am\xa0enjoying thoroughly.''Where have you\xa0been that you think is\xa0perfect for solo female travelers?''Diving in Southeast Asia''I can vouch for almost anywhere in''SE Asia as\xa0perfect for solo female travelers''. That said, a small list of my favorite spots that I plan to return to one day,\xa0will have to be''Hoi An''(Vietnam), Georgetown (Penang,Malaysia), Taichung (Taiwan), Seoul (South Korea),''Chiang Mai''(Thailand), Stone Town (Zanzibar), and Varkala (Kerala,India).''These places feature in the list of my favorites not only because of how safe they feel, but also\xa0because they provide for a\xa0near\xa0perfect combination of culture, aesthetics, nature, friendliest people, great food and even greater value for money. There are amazing, cheap\xa0hostels in all of these spots, making it very easy to meet fellow travelers when I am in that occasional chatty mood.''What does your culture say about solo traveling and how has that impacted your decision to do it?''At the Sam Sand Dunes, Jaisalmer, India''When I first started traveling, it had never\xa0occurred to me that I might one day\xa0be one of the very few solo female travelers originating from India (Asia). My journey\xa0doesn’t come with the luxury of a\xa0security\xa0that is commonly understood or accepted by this society. However, the more I travel, the more I\xa0realize that traveling, especially for someone from my background, is a noticeable\xa0privilege. In the context of a country like India, which proudly holds on to its conservative ideas of cultural,\xa0familial and societal\xa0traditions, it takes a lot of defiance against the strongholds of being a\xa0stereotypical woman\xa0and the obligation to constantly\xa0please the\xa0society around us. We are often fed the idea that our education, the subsequent\xa0jobs and being happily married\xa0are what define our main purposes of life.''The strong notions that a female traveler who constantly\xa0keeps moving may never be able to stop for\xa0a companion or may not be able to save herself from worldly dangers are few\xa0examples of\xa0worries that riddle\xa0many women who eventually\xa0end up hushing the fire within their souls. Add to that, the value of an Indian Rupee is one of the lowest in\xa0the world and\xa0doesn’t\xa0last very long on the road. The struggles of facing\xa0bureaucracy and\xa0obtaining\xa0visas to go to\xa085% of the countries in\xa0the world,\xa0also pose as massive\xa0hurdles and demotivating factors for travelers from India. As I understand all of these hurdles that seemingly\xa0stop people from dreaming beyond their\xa0perceived means, I am more\xa0mindful\xa0of my privilege that comes with being born into a relatively\xa0forward thinking family, of\xa0having had the opportunity to study, live and work in the United States. I have thus been fortunate enough to develop a sort of a blended mindset that helps me understand as well as work with the system, while not letting it hold me down. Some day, I do hope to share my thoughts, my learnings and ultimately my\xa0story with as many\xa0fellow countrywomen as possible\xa0and help to\xa0empower them to realize that no idea or\xa0dream is too big or impossible to\xa0achieve if we set our hearts to it.''How do you make long-term travel financially sustainable?''I had a high income\xa0corporate job in the financial technology industry\xa0for few years before I started traveling. The above average salary, combined with my natural\xa0attitude of\xa0middle class resourcefulness, helped me save up a good chunk of cash with which I could take off. And 18 months on road\xa0later, I am glad to say that I have been able to\xa0spend much lesser than what I had initially budgeted and still have a little left to keep going.''Traveling in Southeast Asia''definitely helps in keeping\xa0the budget in check. As for a sustainable\xa0future, I am toying between the idea of heading back to a\xa0corporate job for few years (to save up again) or to look into remote work opportunities to keep going, and I am yet to decide on one. I will most likely try my hand at both and choose whichever works best for my current circumstances.''How did Be My Travel Muse help you?''At Lake Louis,''Banff, Canada''Kristin and I are of the same age, had similar high strung\xa0corporate career backgrounds, battled with similar lifestyle choices etc. So when I read about how she saved up, quit it all and took off on a one way ticket, it felt like I had just been called. I decided that that’s exactly what I wanted to do and grew even\xa0more confident about doing it solo. And since then, I have visited many spots that BMTM highlighted, stayed at her favorite hostels, followed her guides on hiking etc amongst many other things. BMTM is probably the only blog that comes close to what my travel\xa0blog would look like one day, simply because our interests\xa0and\xa0styles of traveling are almost always similar. So, in short, I owe Kristin big.''What are some unexpected benefits of traveling alone?''Traveling solo tends to push one far and beyond the known boundaries and it definitely taught me what\xa0my fullest capacities and biggest weaknesses\xa0really are.\xa0Its an amazingly liberating\xa0experience.\xa0It is one of the best gifts one could give themselves and I sure am glad I chose to give myself one of these.''In Taipei, Taiwan''A big thanks to Archana for sharing her story with us!

It reminded me a little bit of Disneyland, if you’ve been, in that every little thing was in its place to convey a feeling of magic and fantasy. Every petal\xa0was perfect, the grounds were well-manicured, and even the swans somehow knew how to pose just to make it extra storybook-like.''insert heart eyes emoji''Yes, it is a touristy thing to do and yes, you will be sharing the experience with thousands of people, but in spite of all of that, I think a visit to the Keukenhof is not to be missed if you find yourself in Amsterdam between late March and mid-May. You just don’t get tulip blooms with this much color and variation in most of the world, and that makes this a unique experience.''When to go''Mid-season blooms''The cool thing about the Keukenhof is they make sure to always keep lots of color by planting bulbs that will bloom throughout the season. I never saw a dirt patch or even an area with so much as one dead or dying plant. They go to great lengths there to ensure that the garden always looks spectacular.''There are benefits to going any time, really, and of course timing of certain blooms depends on the year as well. In general, here’s what you can expect:''In late march the colorful crocuses are in bloom and towards the end of the month, the cherry trees blossom\xa0as well.''In April, the early and mid season blooms spring up and leaves start to grow on the trees.''At the end of the season, plan on seeing more late bloomers and dark colors like the black Queen of the Night tulip.''While we’re on the subject of when to go, I highly suggest getting there as close to opening time, at 8am, as possible. By getting there around 9am, I was able to take plenty of photos without other people in them.''Got this little walkway all to myself''This is a seriously popular place, so as the day goes on, plan on seeing a lot more people pouring through the gates.''The good news is,\xa0people did seem conscientious of others taking photos. I took this one in the afternoon and people were nice enough to move out of the way for the shot without me having to ask:''Magic!''How to buy tickets and get there''Given the crowds, it is a very good idea to buy your ticket ahead of time to avoid waiting in line, and that goes for every major attraction in and around Amsterdam.''You can do that here''.''When you arrive, you can show the ticket on your phone and they’ll be able to scan you right in.''When mom and I initially booked, we weren’t sure if we’d rent a car or not (sidenote: After seeing all of the narrow one-way streets in Amsterdam, I’m so glad we didn’t!) so we just bought the €16 ticket without transport.''If you’d like to be dropped off right at the entrance to the garden, the best value is probably the combi ticket, which costs''between €24 and €35'', depending on where you’re coming from. Bus number 858 is the one that will drop you off right in front of the gardens. It picks up at Arrivals 4 at Schipol airport, starting with the first bus at 8am, and running every 10 minutes.''Wonderland''That said, if you plan on exploring more areas around and within Amsterdam on the same day, a regional pass costs €18.50 and includes the bus to the Keukenhoff, plus the airport train and regional trains and busses. If you want to explore more than just the gardens, the best option could be to buy the individual ticket and this day pass, which you can pick up at the I Amsterdam store at the airport as well:''The regional pass''How to maximize your trip to the Keukenhof''The gardens are huge, so thankfully there are plenty of areas to explore. I found that the flowers right by the entrance got overwhelmingly crowded later in the day, so I was glad to have taken a few photos with them right when I arrived.''I probably couldn’t have done this later on''However the farther you move away from the restaurants and entrance, the fewer people you’ll find.''Mom in her element''I’d suggest getting there as early as you can manage, taking the photos that you want to have with the flowers, and then sit back on the grass and have a picnic (the food there is pretty so-so, might as well bring your own).''By mid-afternoon, mom and I had switched to just photographing the flowers, which wasn’t affected by the crowds since they weren’t visible anyways.''There are also options outside of the gardens if you have the time, such as renting a bike and taking the cycling route to see the rows upon rows of tulips and daffodils. This is something I’d love to do the next time I visit.''This was taken in the afternoon – it was still possible to get great photos''I was initially a little bit worried that this would be too touristy for me, that I’d see a bunch of trampled flowers from people taking selfies, and that it would be so overwhelming that I’d just want to leave, but I was pleasantly surprised. Most importantly of all, mom finally got to realize her dream of visiting the tulips in Amsterdam.''Though it will get busy, there’s no denying that, by going early and getting your photos out of the way in the morning before throngs of people show up,\xa0you can enjoy the Keukenhof in all of its touristic glory.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''The 17 Best Places in Europe for Solo Travelers''The Ultimate Berlin Guide: What to Do, See, and Eat!''Underground Berlin: The Fringes of Society''Recycled air that robs your body of moisture, meals loaded with unreasonable amounts of sodium, and tight quarters that cut down on your body’s normal circulation routine are what’s waiting for you in that airplane seat.''For your body and natural glamorous nature, that is the definition of a long-haul flight. Emerging from a transcontinental trek glowing is no easy task and the effort is thought to be reserved for those in first class — but no worries, assembling a simple beauty kit to stay aglow is no complex endeavor. It’s easy-to-achieve for globetrotters on every budget!''I split my life between Europe, New York City and the rest of the world, so I’m no stranger to long-haul flights. I’ve made plenty of mistakes and as a result, countless experiments to nail down an in-flight beauty routine that leaves me looking (and more importantly, feeling) like a normal human being. I’m here to share the products that make up my long-haul flight beauty kit; I swear by these and if I had an important meeting after landing, I wouldn’t be daunted by the thought of putting myself together quickly.''Here are the seven products that make up the beauty kit that follows me around the world:''Facial Oil''Planes will work extra hard to dehydrate you, and for me (my skin is dry as is) normal face cream won’t even begin to keep my skin in check. I indulge in''Sunday Riley’s rich hydroactive cellular facial oil''and it’s my go-to moisturizer both while in transit and at home. Caveat: this is a bit of a splurge when it comes to beauty products, but it works as both a day and night savior and has completely transformed my usually dull travel-stricken to glowing in every climate. Be sure to regularly apply every two hours – once or twice won’t be enough 35,000 feet above.''Extra Hydrating Lip Gloss''When choosing a lip gloss, always go for a product that is loaded with Vitamin E. Try this''ultra hydrating lip conditioner from Jo Malone''— I’m absolutely addicted and keep it in my beauty kit during all seasons.''Rich Eye Cream with De-Puffing Benefits''Black circles, hopelessly puffy and looking as if they just endured a battle — that is the usual dismal condition of my eyes after flying 10+ hours. The only eye cream that has helped me combat travel-induced is''Clinique’s All About Eyes''. This miracle eye friend is great for everyday life too (because, the hustle is real).''Refreshing Face Wipes''For removing makeup in-flight and a cool refresher before you land, lovely smelling facial wipes are must. Be sure to choose wipes with Vitamin C for that extra skin perk and added brightness upon landing; I’m addicted''these wipes from New Age'', as they also have a boost of collagen and line-fighting retinol.''Pre-Landing Face Mask''About two hours before landing, I always treat my face to a moisture-rich mask to soak up. This''Honey Moisture Face Mask from Lather''always relieves my stressed out skin and leaves me ready to tackle any new destination. Loaded with honey (nature’s remedy to everything) and soothing ingredients like olive oil and wheat protein, this is the best way to rejuvenate before running errands.''A Basic Timer''This is one you probably already have on your smartphone. Set a timer to stand up every two hours for at least 30 minutes at a time. What does this unusually lengthy time have to do with beauty? Everything, especially to jet-setters who enjoy retreating to their plane seat cave and never moving again. Regularly standing up and walking, lunging or doing impromptu yoga moves in the back of the plane is actually incredibly important to keep blood flowing and prevent your body from appearing dehydrated.''Statement Accessories''This beauty kit will leave your face ready for its regular routine without showing harrowing signs of long-haul travel, but for that extra confidence boost, I always draw the attention away from my face when landing by throwing on my''favorite sunglasses''and''hat-of-the-moment''(travel essentials in their own right, anyway).''Tips before flight for best results: Exfoliate the morning you fly and wear minimal makeup when boarding the flight (I stick to concealer and lip gloss).

It felt so good to be there even though I was exhausted. It somehow felt familiar even though of course I had never been there before.''Every part of the world has its own feeling and vibe. It’s not just the place but who you are when you’re there. It’s no surprise that in the very place\xa0where humankind originated, it somehow feels so much like home.''I love the friendly smiles, genuine interest locals show, and the warm feelings I have when I’m in beautiful Africa. Over the course of my three visits here I’ve spent a cumulative 6 months in Southern and Eastern Africa, much of it solo. I’ve also invited Helen from''Helen In Wonderlust'', a fellow Africa enthusiast, to share her experiences.''Between the two of us, we’ve got you covered for safety, our best picks of where to go for solo female travelers in Africa, what to pack, how to meet others, and tips for volunteering :''The Best Solo Spots in Africa:''Coffee Bay, South Africa''Walking around Coffee Bay, South Africa''Kristin’s pick: There are few places on planet earth that I love more than''Coffee Bay'', which I passed through on my''South Africa road trip''and then returned to because I couldn’t get it out of my mind.''It’s so beautiful there, with rolling green hills on the coast with colorful rondavels (round huts) dotting the bluffs. If you like to go on long walks, surf, or just hang out in a lush paradise, there’s always something to do and someone around to do it with. I’ll always cherish the time I spent in Coffee Bay!''Click here for more on planning a trip to South Africa''Kendwa, Zanzibar''Love that water and those sideways sails!''Helen’s pick: Zanzibar is a special place. It is a pure melting pot of cultures, most evident in the winding alleyways of Stone town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.''But the beaches are the places to be when it comes to being a solo traveler. I often head there first, as it gives me a chance to meet people with whom to explore the island.''There are a number of different beach villages, each with their own character. However, the one I would recommend for a solo traveler is Kendwa up in the north of the island. Saturday nights on this beach are legendary and every month they hold a Full Moon Party, although it’s a much tamer affair than the ones in Thailand!''There is also a lot of''things to do in Zanzibar'', like SCUBA diving, snorkeling, spice tours, and shopping, so you can easily meet others whilst taking part in one of the many activities on offer.''Tofo, Mozambique''tofo mozambique''Kristin’s pick: Tofo is one of the best places I’ve been solo not just in Africa but in the entire world. Due to a complete lack of information online, I was initially''afraid of going to Mozambique by myself''but it turned out to be the kind of place that attracts really cool and interesting people who I’m still friends with years later.''Tofo''has lots of activities like scuba diving, snorkeling with will sharks, taking an ATV out to the sand dunes, and of course lounging in a hammock (which I did often, tbh). Another unexpected benefit was the cheaper prices for being a single in bungalows. I have never been in a country where I didn’t have to pay the same price for a double as two people. It was always significantly less because I was the only person in the room. It didn’t make sense to me but I’m not asking questions!''Click here for more on how to plan a trip to Mozambique.''Jinja, Uganda''Jinja rafting''Helen’s pick: I absolutely love Jinja, Uganda. Due to its position on the banks of the Nile, it’s the adventure capital of East Africa. Because of this, it attracts a lot of backpackers, volunteers, kayakers and adrenaline junkies.\xa0Uganda is a beautiful country too, with friendly people, gorgeous green hills and dark orange soil.''I spent a couple of weeks staying in the small village of Bujagali, just outside Jinja Town. On any given night there was something going on and a steady stream of people passing through.''But it is also a great place to meet the locals. Every afternoon, when it started to get a little cooler, I would play netball with the girls in the village and would often get invited to dinner at their homes.''Lake Kivu, Kibuye, Rwanda''Beautiful Lake Kivu''Kristin’s pick: This is such a beautiful spot in Rwanda and I was surprised by how many other travelers I met while staying at home Saint-Jean there. Many of them are volunteers of some sort (which is a trend you’ll see repeating in Africa) though some I met were solo travelers passing through.''The area is gorgeous and one of the best activities is to join a group, which you can find easily in the common area, and make a plan to take a boat trip around the islands.''Taghazout, Morocco''Helen’s pick: Morocco is a country with a bit of a reputation when it comes to solo female travel. That said, I had no problems in Morocco whatsoever, despite covering quite a bit of the country, including Marrakech, the coast, the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara Desert. However, I know that isn’t the experience for all women who often complain about the aggressive local touts and catcalling.''One place I found to be particularly lovely was the village of Taghazout. I actually stayed just down the road in Tamraght, but would venture to Taghazout for dinner. It’s a Mecca for surfers and as such draws in a nice crowd. There are plenty of surf schools that cater for everyone from beginners to pros. Staying at a surf school also means that you are pretty much guaranteed to make some friends.''Cape Maclear, Malawi''Cape McLear''Helen’s pick: Known as ‘The Warm heart of Africa’, Malawi is a great place for a solo traveler.''The hub of the tourist activity tends to lie on Lake Malawi, also known as the ‘Lake of stars’ due to the lights of the fishing boats that sit out in the water in the evenings.''Cape Maclear on the southern part of the lake, is a great spot for solo female travelers. The beachy, laid back vibe tends to attract a lot of cool people including independent overlanders and backpackers, so there’s always something going on and someone to hang out with. It’s also a great place for scuba divers, as Lake Malawi is home to more species of\xa0freshwater fish than any other lake in the world.''Nairobi, Kenya''Nairobi''Helen’s pick: Nairobi is one of those places that seems to terrify a lot of travelers.''I understand why, it’s a big city, dirty in parts and it has a reputation for muggings – it’s even nicknamed ‘Nairobbery’. But it is a major transport hub and as such, a great place to start an African adventure. Kenya is English-speaking too, so it’s a good place to get your bearings.''At any hostel in the city, you will meet other solo travellers, many of whom have just arrived too, looking to book safaris and onward adventures so they may become your travel companions.''Personally, I’ve never had a single problem in Nairobi, but it is sensible to always be vigilant when you travel there.''How to meet others while traveling solo in Africa''Friends in Spitzkoppe namibia''Maybe\xa0Africa isn’t the obvious choice for a first time solo female traveler, but I’ve found it to be one of the friendliest places in the world that I’ve traveled through, thanks to kind and curious locals and truly interesting other travelers I met there.''In Helen’s words: Africa was the first place I traveled alone to. I loved it, mostly because there’s a sense of camaraderie among Africa travelers that I have seldom seen elsewhere.''It’s the type of place where you make''friends for life'', brought together by life-changing travel experiences.The backpacking crowd in Africa also tends to be quite varied in age, which is great for me as a 36-year-old solo traveler. Here are a few things I do to make meeting others easier:''Staying in hostels or overland campsites is a great way to meet others''Pick a place that has a good lounge or bar area (there isn’t an abundance of reasonable and good accommodation in Africa, so many travelers gather in the same places).''Booking.com and''hostelworld.com''have the best selection of accommodation in Africa that I’ve found. But there are also some great places that aren’t listed on booking sites, so doing a bit of research is vital. I’ll also ask people for recommendations as I go.''When I arrive anywhere new, I usually drop my bags in the room, head to the bar, grab a beer and start chatting to whoever is about, whether that be the bar staff or other travelers. Before I know it, I’ve usually made a friend or ten.''Helen guiding a tour''Another great way to meet people is to join a small group tour or an''overland tour''. I created my own''small group tours'', to offer something a bit different to the traditional overland or safari tours, that go to places off the main tourist route\xa0and\xa0allow people to get the feel of independent backpacking, but with a group of friends built in to share the adventure.''Tours are a great way to see Africa, especially the more remote places that are difficult to get to without your own transport and\xa0take the hassle out of finding accommodation, organizing all your own activities and working out how to get from A to B. Because of this, they also allow you to see the many of the\xa0main highlights even\xa0if you are\xa0limited on\xa0time.''How to stay safe while traveling solo in Africa''At''Golden Gate National Park in South Africa''Africa gets the reputation of being a ‘scary’ place, even though it’s vast and incredibly varied as far as culture and safety is concerned. Let’s be honest, grand generalizations are almost never correct and that’s the case with ‘Africa’ as well.''Still, mention in casual conversation that you’re traveling solo to Africa and you might be met with horrified faces and scared reactions. Staying safe in Africa boils down to being smart and aware. Here are a few tips from Helen and I to help you through:''• Don’t walk alone at night anywhere, ever. Take a taxi even if it’s short distances.''• Always use a licensed taxi or one recommended by your accommodation. In major African cities, you can often use Uber.''• Travel during the day. The roads are often poorly lit at night and accidents are known to occur due to the potholes in the roads. There have also been some incidences of\xa0carjackings, particularly at night, in major South African cities.''• Don’t drink alcohol excessively or leave your drinks unattended.''• Always listen to your guides, especially when staying in a national park – wild animals are everywhere and you have to respect that you are in their territory.''• In big cities, do the dummy wallet trick: Keep a small amount of cash and some cancelled cards in your purse so that if someone demands it you can easily hand it over, and keep the rest hidden in your bra, or shoes, or locked in the hotel safe.''• Don’t wear expensive jewelery or be flashy. Take caution when looking at your phone in public, it’ll draw attention.''• It’s important to respect the local culture and dress appropriately, covering shoulders, cleavage and legs in some places such as Zanzibar, much of Tanzania, and most of northern Africa including Morocco.''I would also be remiss not to specifically mention the high crime rates in South Africa, and particularly the alarmingly high rate of rape. South Africa’s''income and education inequality''is the highest in the world, creating a large divide when it comes to those who have and those who have not. This results in a lot of desperation and robberies. In the big cities in South Africa, it’s wise to always take an Uber taxi as opposed to walking, to make sure the doors are always locked, and to never leave anything showing in the car – even cheap sunglasses.''Rape typically happens between people who know each other and has the highest instances in the townships. This does not meant that you should stay out of townships entirely, as taking''tours through with a local guide''can be enjoyable. Just practice extra caution in South Africa, and avoid traveling at night.''What to Pack''Safari shorts? Check. ‘Nocs? Check''What should be in your bag when you travel to Africa? That depends heavily on where exactly you intend to go. If in Southern Africa, short shorts and tank tops are just fine. As you head into Eastern and Northern Africa, cultural norms can go from a\xa0bit more conservative to very conservative.''The best types of clothes are lightweight, breathable, durable and layers are your friend. I often just wear shorts/harem pants and a t-shirt. Also, sturdy shoes are a must!''Click here for my comprehensive Africa packing list.''How to get around''Some parts of Africa are easy to get around thanks to great options for backpackers, like Baz Bus or a cheap car rental in South Africa. I arrived solo, but was able to easily find someone to car pool with me right at the start of my trip via my Facebook network. Staying at a social hostel and asking around would likely yield the same results.''In other areas, however, it’s more difficult and often more dangerous to take public transport. In Mozambique, for example, the local mini busses have bald tires, pack in way more people than they have seats for, they pull over constantly, so trips take forever, and I caught the driver swigging a beer while driving on the final trip I took.''You can still rent a car with or without a driver, but that gets expensive once you venture out of Southern Africa. Some people buy 4×4 cars and then sell them after, which I’ve always dreamed of doing with a friend, but probably not solo given my lack of bush and mechanical know-how. Another option is to join an overland tour, which I’ve done previously. As mentioned earlier in this post, these tours are pretty good, even for those who don’t love tours. They’re well-organized and take care of the logistics. I took a''35-day camping and safari tour from Cape Town to Zanzibar''and would recommend it highly!''Volunteering in Africa''Kids in Vilanculos, Mozambique''Many who visit the African continent go with the intention of volunteering. You’ll meet people there who are with the Peace Corps, doing something related to medicine, or they might work for the UN. It’s also important to really consider your skill set and the organization when you volunteer. I recommend reading the''Problem with Little White Girls''before deciding to volunteer in Africa.''Since I’ve never personally done it, and Helen has volunteered quite a bit, here are some of her suggestions for finding the right fit:''• Look for programs that empower the local community, rather than keep them dependent on foreign aid.''• Think about what you can offer based on your skillset and interests. Are you good at accountancy? Then volunteer as an Accountant. Do you know how to fix things? Do something with your hands. Not sure what skills you have? Volunteer as an English teacher, as there’s always a need for native English speakers.''• Think about volunteering with a social enterprise rather than a charity.''• Do your research. Ask the opinions of previous volunteers. In hindsight, do they feel that they made a genuine impact?''• If you’re paying to volunteer, don’t be afraid to ask where the money goes and what positive effects the organization is having on the community.''• Stay away from any programes that offer placements working directly with orphans. Orphanage tourism has become a big business, but it’s one that is constantly debated for ethical reasons.''To find great volunteer opportunities, I recommend that you check out''Idealist.org''or''Grassroots Volunteering.''Elephants crossing in the Ngorongoro Crater''Africa truly is an adventure, and one that would be a pity to miss just because you don’t have anyone to bring along with you. Though I was, admittedly, scared more than a couple of times when heading to Africa on my own, my fear is always replaced by that warm welcome and amazing connection to Africa that I feel each time I’m there.''You don’t have to take my word for it, check it out for yourself and see why so many people fall in love with Africa and can’t keep going back.''For more on how to prep, how to save up and make your money last on the road, how to stay safe, travel for cheap or free, and how to make your gap look stellar on your resume, check out the''guidebook for solo female travelers''with tons of tips and case studies from over a dozen solo female travelers and myself.''Happy travels in Africa and beyond, ladies.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Maputo is Not as Bad as They Say''Forget What You’ve Heard, and Travel to Zimbabwe''Going Alone to Mozambique''The jungle was dense and lush. At some points, it was a steep decline down a narrow path, the vines providing a Tarzan-like feel and reminding me that, yes, I was deep in the home of another creature entirely.''After about an hour, the guide behind me, dressed in a pressed collared shirt as though he were on his way to a party, pointed one out to me in the tree up ahead.''His back to me as he sorted through the leaves, partially hidden by the foliage, he would be my first wild gorilla that I’d ever lay eyes on.''Just a bit farther, they told us. There was a family up ahead.''I rounded another few trees and sure enough, laying on the ground without a care in the world and so much as a head nod in our direction, there was a silverback and his harem including a few babies as well.''Their eyes were glassy and orange. Their feet looked remarkably like mine with ten humanlike toes, and an opposable thumb on their hands which they used for combing through each other’s fur or casually scratching their chins.''There they were!''This is what I was there to see, and though I thought it would be a magical experience, it tops every other wildlife encounter I’ve had to date. They seemed so gentle and beautiful, larger than I’d imagined, and more regal than I could have expected.''It’s an experience that will remain vivid in my mind for ages to come, that much I’m sure of. There is nothing quite like seeing these incredible creatures so close up, and to feel even for a moment like there is a connection, a bond.''I had a lot of questions before I went that I’m sure come up for just about everyone. If you’re dying to experience this too, here are my answers for how to go gorilla trekking in Uganda:''What can I expect when gorilla trekking in Uganda?''A mom and her baby''Gorilla trekking takes place in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in the south of Uganda, just north of the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (hereafter abbreviated DRC) and Rwanda. The park has a northern and southern entrance and accommodation options at both ends. Personally I stayed in the north though I don’t believe there’s an advantage to picking one over the other.''It’s a beautiful park with other attractions like guided hikes and cultural experiences as well, or if you’re like me, just a place to chill in your hammock and read while listening to the sounds of the jungle.''There are several gorilla families within the park that tourists visit with 3-4 trackers and a ranger. The difficulty of the hike and the amount of time it takes depends on which group you are put into. Some\xa0of the treks take place right from the north part of the park on foot and take a couple of hours, and\xa0the rest require a drive to reach and some can take up most of the day.''The gorgeous scenery before we went into the forest''You’ll show up at the park entrance at 7am and the rangers will split you up into groups depending on your perceived fitness level and whether or not you have a driver, though they will keep you with whoever you signed up with, so don’t worry about that! Though I didn’t have a driver and vehicle, I was with a group that had extra room in their car, so I did a steeper hike that was farther from the entrance. That was no problem for me, as I really enjoyed the challenge and getting to spend so much time in the jungle!''In general you should be physically fit enough to hike for at least an hour or two, should be wearing hiking boots due to the steep and muddy terrain, and also the cutter ants that tend to like climbing up pant legs, and should make sure that you bring along water and a packed lunch for the day. If you’re staying in a lodge, they will prepare the water and lunch for you.''Is it safe?''A silverback surveying his kingdom''For a lot of people, the idea of getting up close to a gorilla is pretty terrifying. They’re big and powerful animals, after all!''The gorillas that you’ll see are used to humans, especially the babies who have been seeing humans regularly for their whole lives.''The rangers also carry guns just in case. This isn’t to kill the gorillas, but rather to make noise if need be by shooting away from other animals in the park, like elephants.''They also make sure that you leave any food or water slightly behind on the trail when you do find the gorillas so that you don’t alter their natural behaviors, and at any given time, there will be a ranger or tracker right behind you to make sure that all is well.''Though we did get pretty close, I was in too much awe to be scared during my trek. The gorillas seemed indifferent to my presence.''Is it worth it?''The short answer is yes! This is one of my top ten travel experiences to date, no question.''Look at those eyes!''Trekking to see the Mountain Gorillas comes with a $600 price tag just for the permit in Uganda, unless you go in April or November when they are discounted to $450 due to low season and heavier rains. You’ll also need a method of getting there and a place to sleep and food to eat, of course.''Was so fun to watch the baby playing on the silverback’s back!''You can only see Mountain Gorillas in equatorial Africa, including Rwanda, the DRC, and Uganda.''The cost in Rwanda is $750 and in the DRC, it’s $300, however it’s also less stable politically than the other two countries, and this tends to keep visitors away.''Look how close I was able to get!''There are an estimated 880 mountain gorillas\xa0left in the wild,\xa0many of whom are habituated, which means they are used to humans though they are still technically wild.''As a visitor, that means you can get pretty close to them without them running away. They see humans almost every day, and they know that we don’t hurt them when we come to say hello, so like other nonthreatening\xa0animals, they tolerate us being around.''We stayed with the group we found for about an hour. It was one of the most magical hours of my life, watching the babies drumming on their chests like the big Silverback, and getting to watch the family engage with each other and climb in the trees. It was different to''Chimpanzee trekking'', for example, where we could really only see them from afar and had to do a lot of chasing.''How do I book it? Do I have to take a tour?''Gorillas up close''I couldn’t find much information on doing this independently before I went, and it seemed like everyone else was on a tour (if you want to go that route, they have some options on the''TourismUganda''site).

Here’s how:''Book your permit as soon as you know that you want to do this as it’s a popular activity and permits get booked out weeks or even months in advance.\xa0You can''contact the Uganda Wildlife Authority''to obtain your permit.''You must be healthy on the day of the hike without a cold or anything similar, as you can actually make the gorillas sick given how genetically similar we are.''The toughest part is getting there and getting out again, but you have a few options:''Fly into Kihihi from Entebbe with''AeroLink'', which costs a standard $236 each way. I drove in and flew out, and surprisingly, I was the only person on my flight!''From there, you’ll need a ride to the park, which I paid 80,000 shilling for (about $22).

They should all cost less than 100k shilling.''Bring cash to pay, as ATMs are far away and many of the more affordable lodges only accept cash.''Accommodation:\xa0There is everything from campsites to fancy resorts, though everything in the area is a bit overpriced and provides less value for your money than elsewhere in Uganda.''Let the rangers know when you show up that you don’t have a car but you’d love to join a group with space, or alternatively do the walk to the family that can be reached only on foot.''As far as activities and wildlife encounters in Africa go, this is definitely one of the best. I’d go as far as to say it’s a must-do that shouldn’t be missed.

So I decided to give the readers what they want: the best\xa0vegetarian dishes in Southeast Asia.''Pin me for later!''Vegetarian Dishes in Southeast Asia: A Guide''Useful phrases:''Jay (Thailand)''Means no animals or animal by-products''Chay (Vietnam)''Buddhist restaurant/food stall.

Larb Jay — Thailand or Laos''Photo by''Kimberly'', Used Under''Creative Commons''A Northern Thai and Laotian staple,''larb''almost seems like lettuce wraps — seasoned meat is served inside lettuce leaves (usually as an appetizer). However, you can order this “jay” style, which means that no animals or animal byproducts were used in the cooking process (including stocks and sauces). Instead of meat, tofu is fried up with chilies and a whole host of seasonings like cloves, star anise, cinnamon, and more to give it a healthy and deep kick that your tastebuds will remember for a long, long time.''2. Sambal Goreng Tempeh — Indonesia''Tempeh Goreng, ready to be plated''Tempeh — fermented soybean paste — is not usually on anyone’s list of favorites. But in Indonesia, they take tempeh and elevate it to new heights! They start off by frying the stuff in a wok. Then they throw in''sambal'', Bali’s ubiquitous chili-garlic sauce to bring the fire, and temper it with''kecap manis'', or sweet soy sauce. The result is a swoon-worthy meal that even carnivores will devour like a steak.''3. Jaew Mak Khua — Laos''Photo by''Bertram Ng'', Used Under''Creative Commons''This eggplant-based dip isn’t just vegetarian… it’s found''everywhere''in Laos. Carnivores and veggies alike will love this smoky, earthy dip with the perfect hit of spice. In Laos it’s served with sticky rice and eaten with your hands — making it literally finger-licking good.''4. Tahu Sumbat — Malaysia''In English, it’s ‘fried tofu stuffed with vegetables.’ On your plate, it looks like little tofu tea sandwiches. It’s a crispy fried tofu pillow with an assortment of julienned vegetables: carrot, cucumber, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, and sometimes cilantro. These thinly-sliced veggies are stuffed into a little slit in the fried tofu. The whole thing is served with a deliciously spicy-savory chili sauce that will have you coming back for bite after bite of fresh, crunchy, fiery goodness.''5. Pho Chay — Vietnam''Pho Chay, photo by''Alpha''under''Creative Commons''Being veggie doesn’t mean you need to skip out on Vietnam’s most famous soup! There is a vegan version of this that can be found at restaurants in Vietnam’s major cities. Instead of meat broth (which pho is famous for), this version steeps spices, mushrooms, and other herbs in hot water for a while to infuse the broth with umami heartiness''sans''meat. It’s the closest you can get to the real deal!''6. Khao Piak Sen — Laos''This is the ubiquitous Laotian soup. It’s found on just about every menu in the region, though many times the broth is animal-based. However, at vegetarian restaurants (many can be found in Vientiane), this is often served with a vegetable-based broth instead.''7. Lahpet Thok — Myanmar''Fermented Tealeaf Salad, Photo by''Giminio''under''Creative Commons''Vegetarians sing the praises of Burmese salads, and none gets more recognition than the fermented tea leaf salad, lahpet thok. If you aren’t used to fermented foods, the flavor might take a little tastebud adjustment. But usually after a couple of bites you’ll be vegetarian foodie heaven. The tangy earthiness of the tea leaves is tempered with fresh tomato and cabbage, and loads of texture comes from peanuts and dried peas. Garlic, chili, and lime help punch the other corners of your palate for a satisfying trip to flavor town.''8. Vegetable Amok — Cambodia''Photo by''Praveen''under''Creative Commons''In my last post, I went into raptures about the flavorful, famous Cambodian dish Fish Amok. It turns out, there are usually vegetarian versions of this as well! Many restaurants in Cambodia’s major cities feature that same tangy, sweet, thickly delicious yellow curry sauce with tofu or vegetables instead of fish or chicken. Be aware that traditional recipes for amok curry sauce will usually include shrimp or fish paste — it’s nearly impossible to avoid in Cambodia.''9. Com Ga Chay — Vietnam''Com ga may be one of Vietnam’s most famous dishes. It’s Vietnam’s answer to chicken and rice, but packed with loads of sweetly spicy ginger. Instead of chicken in the “chay” version of this famous dish, wheat tofu is shredded, seasoned and fried to replace the animal meat. The result? You might not even realize it’s not chicken!''10. Mango Sticky Rice — Almost Everywhere''Nearly every Southeast Asian country has a version of mango sticky rice on the dessert menu. It’s a classic sweet treat: coconut milk-soaked rice is a sweet pillow for fresh, delicious mango. Best of all? It’s entirely animal-product free, so even vegans can dig in without guilt.''While researching this article, I found lots of vegetarian and vegan alternatives for many Southeast Asian favorites: curries,''banh mi'', hotpots, and laksa all have meat-free alternatives. Which makes Southeast Asia an excellent option for vegetarian travelers!''What are your favorite vegetarian dishes? Any Southeast Asian dishes I missed that should definitely be on this list?

I’d seen the movie,''Hotel Rwanda''(which was loosely based on reality and shot in South Africa so that gave me very little go on), but that focused on one of the darkest moments in the history of the area and left little to my imagination as far as current affairs, landscape, and things to do in Rwanda.''Upon entering the country, what I found was rolling hill after rolling hill covered in farmland or tea plantations that made way for dense jungles, vast lakes, and massive volcanoes topped with snow. It’s one of the greenest and hilliest places I’ve been, and it seemed like every time I got in the car I was in for a ride with hundreds of twists and turns. That was hard to complain about, though, when the scenery was so beautiful and the surroundings cleaner than anywhere else I’ve seen in Africa, and much of the rest of the world, for that matter.''Can you think of anywhere else\xa0with a ban on plastic bags and a mandatory few hours of community service every month? It’s impressive!''If you find yourself there, know that it’s a small country that doesn’t take much time to traverse, but there is still a wealth of activities. These are some of the best things to do when in Rwanda:''Kigali''The view from my Airbnb in Kigali''Kigali impressed me with its cosmopolitan cuisine and cafes, the sidewalks and street lights – a rarity in East Africa – and the super cool arts and design scene. I spent a few days in the city mostly stuffing my face (eat at the salad bar at''RZ Manna''during the week! So good!) and exploring a bit of the history as well.''Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre''The Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre is the most popular\xa0attraction in Kigali, and for good reason. It’s very well-done, and helps to explain the Rwanda you see today while addressing the dark past.''The Rwandan genocide of 1994 is one of the bloodiest mass acts of violence in modern history with an''estimated 1-2 million people''losing their lives in a span of only 100 days from April to July.''The struggle was borne of a complicated past. Rwanda changed hands a few times before finally ending up under Belgian rule.''During the colonial period, the Belgian administration''applied contemporary Darwinian theories'', which gave the Tutsi minority a favorable position. This essentially\xa0laid the foundations\xa0the genocide to follow by creating inequality amongst the locals, in which the Hutus rebelled against the Tutsi and Belgian elite.\xa0The conflict finally ended in with the aid of the''United Nations\xa0Security Council''.''Since then Rwanda has made strides in unity, with Rwandans identifying themselves as one culture\xa0rather than Hutus and Tutsis, has become the''#1 country for the amount of women in politics'', and has implemented the''Vision 2020''plan which has helped bring over 1 million Rwandans out of poverty. Obviously this is an incredibly abridged history which cannot possibly encompass all of the complexities and happenings, which makes the genocide center a worthy stop if you’re interested in learning more.''Hôtel des Mille Collines''The lobby''The famous inspiration for the Hotel Rwanda, and a place of refuge for nearly 1300 people during the genocide, the\xa0Hôtel des Mille Collines is now a place to ‘see and be seen’ in Kigali.''It’s a 4-star hotel which you can''choose to stay in when in Kigali''(though I stayed at a mansion in the hills for a mere''$25/night via Airbnb''). \xa0Alternatively, it’s free to walk into the lobby, just $5 to hang out by the pool, which is a popular daytime activity, or just\xa0grab a Virunga Mist beer poolside.''Chimp Trekking in Nyungwe Forest\xa0National Park''Hey there, buddy!''Chimpanzee trekking is a must-do when in Rwanda considering that they’re only found in central and west Africa and sadly, their numbers are dwindling. Priced at $90 It’s also a pretty cheap activity compared to other primate trekking in the region (trekking to see the gorillas in Rwanda will set you back $750).''The trek starts at 5am from the visitor’s center just outside the park where you’ll pick up your guide and drive for another hour through the tea plantations while the sun rises.''Gorgeous''From there, grab a walking stick, tuck your socks into your hiking boots to avoid bites from the cutter ants, take a snack and start the hike through the jungle. The trackers will have already been in the jungle searching out the chimp families, and will radio your guide with their whereabouts as you progress.''Once our group found them, they were running around us through the forest, calling to each other and swinging from the trees. It was quite the sight! Though we did have to move quickly to find them and stay with them, it was worth it to see a family hanging out together, eating fruit, and enjoying the beautiful jungle.''Spotted a baby!''Trekking costs $90 per person and you will need to have your own car, or book a car with a driver to take you to the start of the trek from Kigali. It’s best to book ahead of time in the tourism office in Kigali to secure a spot as this is a popular activity.''We camped in the campsite nearby which had a covered camping area and a spot for cooking over a fire plus firewood, at a cost of $30 per tent. There are also tours that can take you there and usually include a few national parks, but not having tested them myself, I can’t recommend any here.''Lake Kivu''Lake Kivu in Kibuye''The days I spent on Lake Kivu were my favorite part of Rwanda, from watching the sunsets and sunrises to taking a little boat tour, it was so relaxing and beautiful. What’s not to love about something that looks this beautiful?''Kibuye''Sunrise in Kibuye''In Kibuye, the best activity is taking a boat around the various islands for 4-5 hours, stopping at a few of them and swimming, hiking through the guava trees and watching the bats, and marveling in awe at the beautiful lake.''Prices vary, but if wandering around town you’re bound to get an offer or two. I met a few others at my guesthouse who overheard me talking about wanting to take a boat tour and invited me to join for a total of 20,000 Francs for the boat which took 6 of us but had space for more. We tipped an extra 5,000 making it just a few dollars per person by the end of it. What a bargain!''At the top of one of the islands after eating about 10 guavas that grew on the trees''For a social atmosphere and the amazing views you saw in the photos above, I recommend''Home\xa0Saint-Jean''where I got a basic ensuite room for around $27 per night with breakfast included, which is a pretty good price by Rwandan standards.''Gisenyi''Sunset from in front of the Serena Hotel''On the north end of Lake Kivu, it’s also worth stopping by Gisenyi to see yet another view of the lake. A popular activity around here is the coffee plantation tours, and it’s also the jumping off point for those who are interested in heading into the Democratic Republic of Congo to see the gorillas and volcanoes there.''Personally, I spent a lot of time at''Calafia Cafe'', which anyone who loves healthy food and has spent a while in Africa will truly appreciate. The beetroot sandwiches and home grown kale had this California girl dancing!''I also enjoyed hanging out at my guesthouse,''Paradise Mahide'', which is locally owned and beautifully situated on the lake. The rooms run about $80/night but you can camp on the lawn on the lake for closer to $10.''Park National de Volcans''Beautiful view of the park''This park has some of the most beautiful landscape in Rwanda and is the spot\xa0you’ll head to if you go gorilla trekking. The photo above was taken on the drive from Lake Kivu to the border with Uganda, with a view of the park.''Mt. Bisoke''If you love hiking and have the time, take a day trek up to Mt. Bisoke to see a volcano crater filled in with water.''Unfortunately I ran out of time and couldn’t do this one, though I would have loved to. If you go for it, you’ll have to pay $75 for the experience, which requires a guide, and be sure to bring along a jacket because it gets cold up there! It’s reportedly a tough and steep hike but for those who love the outdoors, I’ve also heard it’s worth it.''Gorilla Trekking''Gorilla trekking only takes place in the DRC, Uganda, and Rwanda. With only 800 gorillas left in the wild, it’s a rare opportunity to see this majestic primate up close. This is also important to book ahead of time as it’s a popular activity and the amount of tourists allowed on a given day is limited. Since it costs $750 and I was on my way to Uganda where it runs $600 to $450 depending on the month (April is cheaper), I decided to wait.''If you won’t be going to Uganda or the DRC, however, consider spending the money to do this. Seeing wild gorillas is one of my top travel experiences to date.''Akagera National Park''Akagera National Park is Rwanda’s safari destination, with lions, elephants, hippos, zebras, and many other animals including over 500 bird species. It shares a border with Tanzania but unlike its neighbor, park entrance fees are affordable at $35 per person per day and only $7.50 per car. Safari rates with a car and driver, if you don’t already have your own, are a pretty standard\xa0US$175 per half day\xa0(5 hrs), and US$275 for a full day.''Click here''for more info from the national park website.''Since I had just spent 11 days between the''Ngorongoro Crater''and the''Serengeti in Tanzania'', I did not visit this park, but I can imagine it’s a worthy stop if you have the time and interest, and probably less popular and crowded than its southern and eastern cousins as well!''—''My\xa0time spent in Rwanda was eye opening. I wouldn’t have expected that much greenery, those dreamy lakes, and the cleanliness that I found there. Then again, I’m not sure what exactly I''did''expect, so what I found there impressed me regardless.''It’s not a big place, and it doesn’t need the weeks and weeks that I’d suggest for''Tanzania''and Uganda, but it’s definitely a worthwhile place to explore while between the two.

They both have the exomesh, RFID-blockers, and strong zippers as well.''With the purse in Tanzania''I make myself the least attractive target that way.''I also lock up my belongings in my''Pacsafe wire mesh bag protector''. Unless your room has a safe, use this to lock your things up. It’s very common to have money or items stolen in Africa.

One of the only Fair Trade certified establishments in South Africa, they give a lot back to the local community and bring in experienced volunteers and medical experts to provide assistance in the local township.''I loved staying there knowing that in good conscience I was supporting a place that gives so much back. Just by laying on the beach and enjoying their gorgeous ensuite accommodation (with the above view!), I was helping in a small way, too. One could spend days or even weeks surfing, going for long walks, and swimming in the gorgeous waters in Cinsta.''Lay your head:''Offering a range from backpacker and tent accommodation to the more upscale but still affordable ensuite and family options,''Buccaneers''is the best possible\xa0choice.''The Karoo''Hang out on the edge''I absolutely love this place. Most people would probably skip it or just pass right through, but it’s such a nice deviation and lesser-known alternative to the touristy Garden Route. Take a look at my nearly-poetic love for this place''in this post''so you can see, and feel, what I mean.''Do yourself a favor and do stop here. Seriously. It’s so wild, so spacious, and so serene all at the same time.''Deserts are special that way.''Lay your head:''The Rest Farm''holds a special place in my heart. It’s great for lounging or volunteering in exchange for room and board. In the coming months various workshops will be taking place there, too.''Nature’s Valley and Bungee Jump''Off and away!''This was unfortunately a quick pass-through for us but one that won’t soon be forgotten. There are great treks around Nature’s Valley that I wish I’d had a chance to check out. Top-of-the-list went to''bungee jumping at Bloukran’s Bridge'', which is the highest natural bungee jump in the world.''Lay your head'': The guesthouse here,''Wild Spirit'', is seriously cool. It has a treehouse, drum circle area (with hula hoops because those are important, too), piano room, and a deck with a beautiful view. Nearby, a dairy which produces nearly all of its own products (or sources locally), serves a delicious and cheap breakfast.''Unfortunately, because I wanted to love everything about this place, I hate to say that the dorms left a bit to be desired. They felt too cramped and old. I’d go for a private room or the campgrounds instead next time.''Wilderness''Once you hit Wilderness, you’ll know you’re in the Western Cape. The circular huts of the eastern part of the country fade and make way for picture-perfect beachfront cottages. It’s not that one is better than the other. I missed the rugged style of the east, but to each her own, right?''The sunset here wasn’t the typical orangey-pink sherbet sunset I’d normally think of to characterize a spectacular sunset. Rather, it consisted of wispy clouds, purple, periwinkle, and soft blues. The sky seemed massive that day over an expansive beach and the sun appeared to take hours to set. The day just didn’t want to end, it seemed. The waves on the sand mirrored the sky perfectly in a blurple (that would be, blue + purple) explosion. It was poetic.''Cape Town''Table Mountain Beauty''The way table mountain rises like a towering giant in the middle of the city – as if life gathered and grew around it – is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. As such the outdoorsy type has an almost limitless amount of adventures to experience here, from day hikes to multi-day treks, various water sports, kite-boarding, diving, and shark encounters.''I admit this is the most beautiful city I’ve ever been to, with funky neighborhoods such as Woodstock, and posh beachside neighborhoods such as camp’s bay.''Cape Town is the place of models and movie stars, glittering frigid waters and a tourist favorite.''Lay your head:''I’d suggest an''AirBnB''rental which provided a better value than hostels in Cape Town.''While this itinerary certainly doesn’t exhaust the options, it’s perfect for a 2-3 week jaunt through the country seeing the highlights – both the better and lesser-known ones.''Pin me!''Sign up for the newsletter for more travel tips!''READ NEXT:''7 Reasons to Visit South Africa, the Rainbow Nation''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''The Perfect California Road Trip''The Perfect Iceland Ring Road Itinerary''An Awesome American Southwest Road Trip Itinerary''The following guest blog is by Kirstin Winkler of the blog,''3 Days*'':''It hit me the second I inspected the obligatory post-breakup haircut. This new regrettable ‘do wouldn’t heal my bruised heart and the emotional wounds would only continue to fester unless I embraced a more drastic change – a geographical one.''After years of together-ness I was facing on-my-own-ness again which didn’t gel with the concept of misery loving company. Recruiting friends for this much needed adventure proved trickier than expected, though. They were breeding, broke, or simply not lusting to wander, and I was facing the first world problem/dilemma of whether to stay put and sulk in my misery or hit the road without companionship – an idea that only fueled my innate fear of loneliness.''Admitting to loneliness isn’t exactly attractive and in case you haven’t noticed – it is the ultimate conversation stopper. No one likes to admit to feeling emotionally isolated and a confession is usually met with uncomfortable side-glances at best.''Why on earth I (mid 30s and all) had to find myself back at relationship square 1 with the holidays approaching quickly was beyond me. The idea of a tearful, semi-intoxicated Christmas dinner with my coupled family members and investigating what went wrong with my pregnant girlfriends was as appealing as an abscess. The vision of clutching a pisco sour, pathetically slouching against an empty Peruvian hotel bar didn’t exactly excite either, but fuck it! It had to be done.''So I booked it: Los Angeles —> Lima —> Mancora —> Cusco —> Machu Picchu!''I admittedly started my trip soaking in my very own pity pool. There were a lot of tears, and maybe even a few fist punches into the hotel pillows. But it didn’t take long to recognize that the geographical distance made room for much-required self-reflection and a decluttering of the mind. Hedonistic self-loathing and an unhealthy dose of self-pity slowly made room for more clarity and an emotional and mental inventory check.''Luckily, the new environment and daily adventures prevented my overactive mind from sliding too deep into the rabbit hole. A few days into my stay in Mancora, a laidback beach town in northern Peru, I noticed a new emotion bubbling up… a sense of freedom and independence. Granted, this new sensation of empowerment flip-flopped with my lingering sense of defeat at mind-boggling speed but hey… baby steps.''The epiphany came on Christmas Day. A pair of lounge chairs on the beach was patiently waiting for two lovebirds to take a seat and chirp “I love you so”. But since it was just me, I gazed at the empty chair next to me, then the deserted beach beyond, expecting to experience the crushing weight of my loneliness. Yet I didn’t. For years I had felt the regular pinch of loneliness although I was with someone and for years I had felt lonelier in a relationship than I did flying solo at that very moment. Sulking, I would converse with the beach crabs while waiting for Him to catch just one more bloody wave. Moping, I would nurse my Piña Coladas alone as He was busy waxing his board. You see the pattern, right?''But in that moment I finally grasped that being alone is a physical experience while feeling lonely is an emotional one. Both of these experiences are separate from each other and only I am responsible for feeling whole. Not my partner, my family nor my friends. This clarity was immensely empowering and as corny as it sounds, I finally was able to rein in my emotions that had been bucking like a mad bronco. And when my new anthem, Dancing on my Own by Robyn started to sound redundant, I opened the door for some socializing only to be blown away by the amount of delightful solo travelers on similar journeys.''Traveling on my own and open to engage I met some of the most interesting people. Take the jolly Canadian who inspired me to shed my prejudice about Ayahuasca and finally give it a try (different story). Or the septilingual homeless philosopher in Cusco, who knows more about the pitfalls of the European Union than most political science majors.''Then I met Fredo, the Chilean unicorn (human rights lawyer, kind, fun and hot – I mean, really?). In midst all this soul-searching, independence-reclaiming and self-finding there was still room for a steamy vacation romance after all.''I was okay. It was all going to be okay.''For all you hesitant solo travelers out there, it’s only normal to experience cold feet. But don’t let your fear stop you. Give yourself that gift of temporarily unplugging, removing yourself from grinding routines and spread sheets. There’s no better time to unabashedly indulge in your own quirks, embrace your own moods and follow your own bliss when there’s no one around to judge. Whether you are feeling like an introverted grouch or a social butterfly, the choice is yours.''Solo travel allows you to connect with inspiring strangers from around the globe but it also allows us to get to know ourselves a little better. So put the phone away, get out there and strike up a conversation. And remember that being alone is a physical experience, while feeling lonely is an emotional one. Only you hold the power to your feelings and being on your own doesn’t equate with loneliness!''About the Author:''Kirstin\xa0Winkler was born and raised in Munich.

This country really does have it all for adventurers who want a real taste of Africa. So don your safari hat and grab your binoculars!''This itinerary focuses on what’s known as the ‘northern circuit’ with a few randoms that I enjoy thrown in. Most of the famous must-sees are in the northern part of the country, though the south has some fantastic national parks and areas that are also worth exploring. With that in mind, here’s my ideal Tanzania itinerary which would take about two weeks, give or take:''Zanzibar''Love that water and those sideways sails!''Zanzibar is probably a name you’ve heard before, synonymous with white sand beaches and bright blue\xa0water. It’s not just fancy editing used on the photos, guys, it really looks like that! You could spend weeks on Zanzibar alone, enjoying spice tours and the culture of Stone Town to the beaches elsewhere on the island.''The diving there is great, as is the snorkeling, the little islands you can visit, the seafood, and wealth of activities.

You’re unlikely to run into many other tourists there or even touts on the beach. The water is still warmer than bath water and if you really just want some peace and an untouched beach, this is it.''There’s still plenty to do, from kayaking down the coastline and into the mangroves to hiring a boat to go to the sandbar that only appears during low tide and snorkeling.

Lushoto is mostly farmland with a few national parks thrown in. Guided walks to the waterfalls and through the parks are available – as in most of East Africa, you can’t go without a guide, as it’s a way to create local jobs.''I found that the people were incredibly friendly in Lushoto, always saying “karibu” (welcome) as I walked by. The children were adorable too, running out of their huts to say hello.''Best of all, the Irente viewpoint truly is incredible, providing views of all of the surroundings. On a clear day, for just $1, you can walk to the viewpoint and see for miles and miles. This is a great place to stop to break up the drive between the coast and the inland attractions like the Serengeti and Kilimanjaro. How long you’ll want to stay depends on how much hiking you want to do in the national parks. For me, this was just a two-night pit stop.''Click here''for tips on seeing the viewpoint and where to stay.''Moshi (Kilimanjaro)''Moshi is the base for Mount Kilimanjaro, one of the most famous climbs in Africa and the tallest mountain on the continent at 5,895\xa0meters (19,341\xa0feet). It’s a very popular climb, with treks ranging from 6-8+ days over several routes departing regularly from Moshi. You must take a guided hike, and you must be ready for some serious altitude!''There are other hikes in the area too, like Mount Meru which is slightly lower than Kili (but still the fifth highest mountain in Africa at over 4,500 meters) that is only 70km away. If you have the time and the desire, both are reported to be amazing hikes.''I haven’t hiked either one myself, though I’m an avid hiker. Time wasn’t on my side this time around but I’m heading back in January to climb both!''Even if you don’t plan on climbing, the drive is long from Lushoto to Arusha, the jumping off point for the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater, so it’s worth a stop to sample the local coffee and take in the views of Kilimanjaro from below.''Ngorongoro Crater''Elephants crossing in the Crater''The Ngorongoro Crater is one of the most beautiful places for safari that I’ve ever seen. Even though the Serengeti can often be dry and yellow, the crater experiences a good amount of moisture and jungle-like flora all around the rim where clouds collect, resulting in a greener and more lush caldera.''This is the place to see black rhinos on your trip, particularly if you follow a few specific tips, like going super early and getting the right guide, to get better chances of seeing them and the other animals in the crater.''Click here for my best suggestions for your crater experience.''Serengeti''What the safari vehicle looks like''While the Ngorongoro crater may be small, and doable in a day, the Serengeti National Park is absolutely humongous and to do it justice, give it at least 2-3 days of game drives for a chance to see leopards, lions, cheetahs, plenty of buffalo and elephants, and during the right time of year (February to March), the wildebeest migration.''You’ll see all of the other usual suspects too, like hippos, giraffes, zebras, and warthogs, just to name a few.''The zones surrounding the park are also full of wildlife, and have some amazing places to stay as well.''Click here for information plus a discount on the safari that I did through the Serengeti''.''Tarangire''Hey guys!

Is that ok to do?''Then I wonder for a moment how close I was to getting trapped in my tent, engulfed in mud. Did that warrior save my life? Was it that dire? I wouldn’t have known until the water was infiltrating my tent. Within seconds, it would have been well up over my head.''I’ll never know, but I do know that it was only the two of us down there, and that he could have just as easily ran but he risked his life too and warned me. There was no way to know then\xa0how fast and high the water would rise.''Is this part of the story? It must be. Just like every traumatic\xa0event, I wonder if it is the catalyst, one that will only make sense later. But there is one thing for sure, right now I just wish it would not rain anymore.''Please stop with those thumb tacks falling on the tin ceiling. We’ve had enough.''Tomorrow will be telling. Will the truck start? Is it just a goner now? Is the end of the road here? Is the warrior still watching, in case it happens again?''After that, I watched the rain for a few more hours before passing out. When the birds started chirping in the morning I awoke with a start. I was okay, and all of my stuff was okay, but was the car done for?''I walked outside to survey the damage. It was mud-topia. Seriously, if the circumstances had been different, and there weren’t rocks and acacia thorns and perhaps the odd fork or knife from the picnic areas lodged in it, we could have all had one epic mud fight.''That’s a lot of mud''The real hero of the story are Ma and BJ of the snake park, who gave us a room the moment they realized what had happened, gave us T-shirts so that we’d have dry clothes to wear, fed us breakfast and dinner, and fixed the car in their mechanic shop on site, all for free, and all with a smile even though they were suffering too. After all, they were watching their home flood.''The mud and water narrowly missed the engine (pictured are some of the Maasai guards)''Native South Africans, Ma, Deon, and BJ moved up from South Africa in the early ’90s, bought a plot of land with nothing on it,\xa0planted trees and flowers, and adopted reptiles, which is a family passion.''Check him out!''They have vipers, spitting cobras, crocodiles, and the famously venomous black mamba onsite. They also have the only anti-venom clinic in the area, and offer free care for snake bite and burn victims.''One of their huge pythons – I’m a snake one and had a pet python myself when I was younger''They’ve also got camels, a Maasai cultural center, an orphanage, and a full mechanic shop onsite. If you’re going to get caught in a flood, I suppose the''snake park''is the best place where it could happen.''Over the next couple of days that felt stuck in time, I hung in my hammock, talked to another camper there and enjoyed the chance to get to know someone new, looked around at all of the beautiful flowers and trees they had planted, and all of the birds that it attracted, and allowed myself to really see and appreciate it all.''This was barren land before''I’m thankful to have met people with such big hearts, and though this might sound crazy, I feel lucky for the experience.''I feel lucky that the Maasai guard was watching that night, that the flood wasn’t any faster or higher, and that the adventure, at least for now, continues.''And I’m reminded that life is short, which is something I knew already, but didn’t think about nearly enough.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Adventures in Swakopmund, Namibia: Sandboarding and Skydiving''Taking a Long Walk Off a Short Bridge: The World’s Tallest Bungee Jump''I often see comments on my posts about solo female travel asking if most of who is on the road are gap yearers and 20-somethings.''If I’m in my 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and upwards, will I be the only one?

If you mention the name Indonesia anywhere in the world, you will more than likely excitedly be told about the incredible waves and off the beaten track roads that should be explored in this natural paradise. Bali is the perfect location for any adventurous soul hoping to learn to surf.''As a young, female, South African surfer girl, the ocean has always been a huge part of my life. Last year, I\xa0 encountered a new romance at my local spot where I was working as a surf instructor, which led me to embark on an exciting new adventure by jet setting to Bali in order to join my man. Enjoying the equatorial bliss on an unforgettable surfing adventure is definitely a better option than enduring another European winter!''4 months later I’m still in Bali, surfing some insane spots, pushing my limits both mentally and physically, while improving my surfing a heap load, but I still remember what it was like way back when I was learning the craft. Indonesia may cater to more advanced surfers with its sharp, coral reef sea floors in shallow break zones, strong currents, fast breaking waves with generally more steep, hollow, heavy take offs, particularly when bigger swells kick in. But wherever there are waves, there are always opportunities for newbies to experience and learn one of the greatest extreme sports that exists!''Major tips to note before surfing in Bali''Never go alone''Know your entry & exit points''Know your hazards – currents, (rip) tides, reefs, rocks etc''Know the crowd – aggressive/ competitive or sheer no. of people''Type of wave – size & hollowness, speed & heaviness''High/ low tide hours – especially for reef breaks''Best time to surf is during the dry season – April to October.''The 5 Best spots to learn to surf in Bali''Kuta''Padang Padang right''Thomas Beach''Balangan''Nusa Dua''BY REGION:''South West Coast of Bali- \xa0Kuta, Canggu & Seminyak''Kuta''Kuta is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Bali. Huge selections of bars, restaurants and cafes are jotted all over town, many of which are within walking distance to Kuta Beach.\xa0Kuta is the number 1 surf spot to learn to surf in Bali as it is one of few beach breaks the island has to offer. Beach breaks, meaning the floor is soft from sand, enables one to risk more and not have to worry about hitting, or more so not hitting, cement like plateaus found at reef breaks at other spots around Bali. Soft, mellow waves break far out from the shore, creating thick foamies that are perfect for giving time to try stand up and get a good length of ride.''The surf schools on Kuta beach are usually a simple set up of big soft boards propped up next to plastic chairs and tables, strategically placed under big tropical coconut trees where the locals will sit and enjoy chatting to anyone interested in taking up their services or simply wanting to know them! Go to a school where you feel most comfortable. All the guys are super friendly and will teach you the basics of what you need to know. They will give you a nice soft board, super for learning on, and look after your belongings while in the water.''The instructor will give you a quick introduction on the beach about how to stand up, control your board and basic tips on safety. Kuta is renown for being a bit of a jungle in the line up as when bigger waves start rolling in, many learners are likely to abandon their boards to dive under oncoming waves. Keep your eyes open and expect the unexpected!''The wave itself is soft. It’s easy to paddle out when the swell is small and white water enables beginners to choose how deep they would like to go. Anyone not so confident in the ocean can stay waist deep where you can still have fun and an all round wonderful experience without fear. For those getting the knack of it quickly, take a chance riding sideways out back! This is the perfect place to do so!''Hazards –''Big crowds including surfers & swimmers. Boards flying around, Drop-ins and out of control boardriders in the lineup.''Ideal Learning Conditions''– 2-4ft. Offshore wind. Any tide – low/ mid/ high. As Kuta is notorious for its pumping nightlife, hangovers may prevent early rises for uncrowded early morning surfs.''Canggu &''Seminyak''North of Kuta, these are''slightly heavier breaks for more advanced and confident surfers. The waves are generally bigger, faster, more hollow, and close out quicker than Kuta. One needs to know how to pop up fast and ride sideways along the wave. Going straight down the face in the direction of the beach will lead you directly into the impact zone, probably after an epic, jaw dropping nose-dive which is more likely to entertain sun bathers watching from the safe banks of the shore!\xa0 These spots can be worth the challenge to push your limits and try advance your surfing post-Kuta. However, be aware of solid reefs, strong current & rip tides. Waves can also appear much smaller from the shore than what they actually are in the water.''SLEEP:''The best place to look for accommodation in Kuta are on websites such as Agoda and Booking.com. The area of Legian and Kuta should be used as reference. Minimum per night can be as low as 50,000 IDR, average around 150,000 and more upmarket places are from 350,000 IDR onwards.''EAT:''Just walking off the beach will lead you onto a coastal strech of bars, restaurants and cafe’s, catering to all budgets. Either eat a local dish on the beach itself\xa0 (fruit salads/ rice with chicken) at local rates. Otherwise, find a place that suits your cravings on the road off the beach.''Bukit/ Pecatu Region – Southernmost tip of Bali''Host to world class surfing waves and World Tour surf competitions, the Bukit/ Pecatu region is renown for its incredible consistency in delivering perfect waves and its ability to hold any size swell, especially during the dry season.''The beaches in this region have exquisite, picturesque backdrops of tall, steep cliffs with thick green overhangs from flora and fauna that have nestled into the golden rocks. Gorgeous golden sand and transparent, turquoise water make it a beachlovers paradise, while warm water enables hours of bathing with or without a board. The breathtaking beauty of boulders and reefs tracing the shoreline make these surf breaks unforgettable and easily distinguishable from other regions in Bali. However, when it comes to surfing, the jaggered sea floor becomes a hazard and something all surfers need to be aware/ careful of. kissing the reefs will likely leave some daunting scratches or open wounds, and infections are easily attainable if sores are not attended to with care.''BEST Bukit spots for learning to surf''Padang Padang – Right!''Thomas Beach''Balangan''Bingin''Uluwatu''Nikos Beach''Mushroom Rock''Seringan''Padang Padang Right''There is the famous, barreling, \xa0left-hander wave hosting the annual Padang Padang Cup that should be avoided at all costs! It is a heavy wave for advanced surfers only – a definite NO NO for beginners! The wave you are looking for is the mellow right that breaks almost directly in front of the beach, closer on the inside towards the shore. A nice right peeling wave works on all tides, although it’s better to paddle out mid- high tide when there is more water covering the reef. When the swell is big, currents can become strong and waves more wild. A surf school set up on the beach is run by locals that will explain everything you need to know. You can trust they will never take you into conditions they feel are too dangerous. Board rentals are also cheap – 150,000 IDR so should you feel you want to continue surfing after a lesson, its possible to do so. A lesson before attempting to go solo is recommended for getting to know dangers.''The walk down to Padang beach is often a tourist attraction in itself, with a natural gateway of steep concrete steps carved alongside a large boulder leading into a narrow cave and widening out at the bottom. Many people enjoy taking a moment to photograph this spectacle of an entrance. Trying to manoeuvre through this slot with a surfboard can be quite tricky. The best is to make sure you don’t end up behind a tour group that have gingerly stepped off their bus!''Ideal surfing conditions –''3-5ft waves, light offshore wind, mid to high tides.''Hazards –''Hard reef floor, strong currents and big crowds.''Beach Info –''Entrance fee is 10,000 IDR per person. Parking fee for bikes is 2,000 IDR. The beach almost disappears on peak high tides and monkeys also like to roam around, so be careful where and how you leave belongings. Food and drink is sold at stalls on the beach. Lunch will cost you \xa0around 30 -50,000 IDR. Cheaper options are found on the main road not even 5min walk away, including minimarts for those on a tighter budget.''Thomas beach''Thomas Beach is''a mix between a reef and beach break. Swell has to be pretty large for these waves to be surfable, usually when Uluwatu is 6ft+, but when it does, there are awesome, fun and easy lefts that peel off from the side of the cliff on the far left hand side of beach, and faster, more close out lefts and rights breaking in the middle. The left’s seem to form better and open up for longer in the sense it will give a longer length of ride with opportunities to attempt basic turns.''In the middle of the beach, the rocky coral reef almost zigzags across the shore so there are sections where the ground is soft and other sections hard. Because the wave breaks further out in some places, the white water created enables beginners to attempt to surf just the foamies, although it’s better to attempt the drop at the left hand peak to give more time to stand. It’s by far one of the easiest waves this side of the coastline and is unlikely to be crowded, as large swell attracts surfers to neighbouring spots.''The beach itself is only a few hundred metres long but has soft golden sand, rich blends of lush green vegetation crawling down the sides of the cliffs and lining \xa0the back of the beach, adding a gorgeous backdrop to this majestic bay. The tall cliffs, trees and bushes provide shelter from the scorching sun on hot afternoons. Very low tide exposes the dry reef and enables a stunning walk deeper out towards the flawless aqua blue sea, or adventure behind the boulders on either end of the beach.''Hazards –''Low tide reef exposure and close outs.''Beach info –''No entrance fee. Steep flight of stairs from the parking lot to the beach. Lifeguards monitor the beach.''Balangan''A left-peeling point break perfect for beginners. A coral reef base lines the shore, but at the peak there’s much deeper water making it easier to take the drop. The beach itself is absolutely gorgeous with the massive golden cliff and it’s lush green overhang towering over the transparent water, as well as colourful and lively coral adding an extra tropical sensation to the surf experience. Balangan is easy to get to, easy to paddle out into and a great option to start learning how to ride green waves.''Bingin''This is a popular spot for families with younger children as the gorgeous enclave delicately lined with soft white sand provides a lovely ambient for playing on the shore, splashing in the warm ocean and simply relaxing in beautiful Bali! Bingin has breathtaking picturesque views, wonderfully convenient in having a selection of cafes and restaurants up on the rocks and good to advance in surfing!''Bingin is a left breaking wave where swell can reel in some bomber barrels and impressive crowds for surfing. There are no surf schools on this beach, but surf shops or camps providing lessons may bring you here if they feel it is safe to do so. It’s only possible to Learn to surf on higher tides and small surf days as the shallow water crashing onto rugged reefs can be hazardous to any surfer, let alone beginners. The end section of the wave is usually more shallow than the take off, but when the waves break further out or at least on higher tides providing added depth for cushion, the foam that rolls in from the broken waves have quiet a bit of kick to them.''Surf schools will usually opt for going to Padang Padang as its simply easier to coach there than it is at Bingin.''Impossibles''is another famous wave right next door. However going out back would not be recommended as the spot got its name for a reason!''Hazards –''competitive/ aggressive crowds, strong currents, big waves, and a shoreline scattered with rocks on top of hard reef. Avoid low tide at all cost and make sure you paddle toward the beach and not restaurants for safe exit. When the waves are big, they are tricky for a beginner. Only go on small days – Max 4 ft.''Beach info –''car\xa0park fee is 5,000 IDR. The stairs are to the right. Ask locals if unsure on directions, otherwise you can end up confused as to how you haven’t made it to the beach after walking a while! It is safe to leave valuables and personal belongings on beach and in one of beach cafe’s, but try not take any expensive items of you plan to leave belongings alone…you never know!''Uluwatu''By far the most famous surf break in Bali, this is one of the most amazing, exciting, exhilarating and just awesome spots for surfing, sunbathing and sightseeing. Breathtaking panoramic views of the ocean, impressive cliffs and heavenly tropical beaches makes this a special location for witnessing some truly stunning\xa0 sunsets.\xa0 The beaches at Uluwatu are relatively small. Weaving your way down between the numerous restaurants built into the rocky cliff side, the zig zag descent leads you to a magnificent cave that is the entry point for surfing and exploring this unique paradise.''Live coral reefs expand deep out to sea with narrow enclaves, creating a mix of aqua, sky and Safire blue ocean lines from above . At low tide, the water sucks out and exposes the algae that has grown over the shingle reef. Narrow stretches of golden sand are elegantly tucked between the reef and cliffs, providing a perfect base for a sunsational sunbathing session!''The name “Uluwatu” means Lands End (Ulu)\xa0 Rock (Watu) and understandably so when you see the outstanding magnitude of the tall cliff.\xa0 The most amazing part of Uluwatu beaches is the cave – the entry point to sea and beaches. Steep manmade stairs etched into the side of the cliff lead into a natural arc with big, dark rocks contrasted by thick green foliage. Early in the morning, rays of sun shoot their beams through the crevices and into the transparent ocean below.''Uluwatu surf has many sections. Although not recommended for first time surfers, Inside and Outside corner are the safest options for beginners. It should only be surfed on mid to high tide to have water covering the coral platform and swell should not be greater than 4ft. The reef here is vicious. It’s not uncommon to see guys being shifted to hospital with holes, lacerations or serious head injuries. This is not to create fear, but the reality is the floor here feels like cement, with lively, razor-sharp coral that cut on the slightest skim. Smaller waves requires more water, as they break and close out faster.''Uluwatu has some exaustingly strong currents pushing down towards the rocks in the direction of Thomas Beach. Every time you catch a wave, you need to paddle out in the direction of the horiz on before you paddle left towards the peak. Exiting the water requires slipping back through the cave mouth. Bad timing or positioning for exit can lead to all sorts of trouble. (See my blog''“Unleash in Uluwatu”''for some first hand account of such an occasion!)''Hazards''– Extreme Currents! Hard coral reefs, impatient surfers and ruthless crowds, sometimes more than 70 people in the water at one time. This is one place you must respect the locals. Dropping in on one, or interfering w ith their wave somehow, can be the end of your surf at Uluwatu.\xa0 Monkeys hanging around the restaurants or down the path heading towards the cave can be little buggers, especiallly if in a pinching mood.''Beach Info –''Entry Fee for motorbikes is 5,000 IDR. It’s NOT safe to leave belonging in your vehicle. All food and drinks can be bought at any of the restaurants. The very first two as you walk down from''the car park are the most expensive and overpriced even for someone not on budget – Single fin, the most famous in this area, is also renown for its Wednesday and Sunday night parties, h osting awesome international DJs and a hot spot for meeting others during your stay.''EAT:''Warung Noodle Heads'', 5mins drive up the road (going away from the beach) from Padang, owned and run by a wonderful local Indonesian lady who speaks fluent English – Saffire, eat your heart out on the most delicious and massive portions of rice, noodles, salads, ribs, sandwiches and other mouth-watering dishes! Prices are super cheap – 35K IDR for “double portions” that can be shared between two, if not 3 people! Usually open from 2pm-10pm Tuesday to Sunday.''STOP Makan''– situated on Jimbaran main road. It’s more central for Balangan beach or\xa0 heading to Nusa Dua. Great buffet style Halal and Indonesian food where you select what you want and pay for your plate. Awesome, rich and tasty dishes give opportunity to taste a variety of new flavours and food combinations at very good prices. The inside decor is very artistic, rustic and colourful with funky signs such as “looking for wi-fi? Try looking for your wife!”and “life’s better on the beach”. A very vibey Warung worth the drive for a decent lunch or dinner.''Pizza Italia''– At the top of Jl. Labuhan Sait, the name says it all. Decent pizza and pasta with good portion sizes are sold until late in the evening. A bit pricey but a great alternative to having a break from chilli loaded local dishes. Service charge of 15% is added to bills, so just be aware of this… expect to pay around 100K per person per meal.''Beach cafes & warungs''– At each surf spot, any of the cafes/ warungs will sell local dishes, such as Nasi or Mie Goreng (fried rice/noodles with vegetables & chicken), sandwiches, omelets etc. International dishes are usually quiet a bit more expensive. Soft drinks are sold between 10-15,000 IDR, Coffees around 20K and beers roughly 30K. Meals usually start at 30,000 IDR.''SLEEP:''Nightly rates usually start from 250,000 IDR per room, getting more expensive with closer proximity to beaches or offering views.

They can arrange motorbike rentals or help with car rental contacts for the duration of your stay.''Type Uluwatu, Padang Padang or Bingin on''Agoda.com''or''Booking.com''for more options.''Nusa Dua''This is by far the cleanest, most pristine, golden sand beaches of the entire Pekatu Region. Nusa Dua is a wealthy area lined by upmarket resorts and a fabulous complex that has everything from shopping centers, cinemas, water parks and an incredible hospital of international medics and standards. There are several different surf breaks within Nusa Dua that cater to all different types and levels of surfing. Beginner spots include – Nikos Beach & Mushroom Rock.''Nikos Beach''This is the first break heading into Nusa Dua from Uluwatu. It has a hollow, fast, barreling right that breaks over coral reef, on the far right hand side of the beach, closest to the pier. Right next to this, there is another right breaking wave, with slightly deeper water than the shallow reef break and a much softer,\xa0 slower and easier drop where many beginners like to hang out. There is also a third section more on the inside, closer to the left hand side of the beach, that only works when the swell is bigger and on a higher tide. The wave is short so it’s not possible to ride a long time, but it’s easy to catch and practice getting to your feet quickly.''Nikos has one surf school in the far left corner of the beach that many foreigners use for lessons and board rentals. Nikos is a great place to learn as the beach is more secluded by being situated in front of classy resorts that pay great attention to upkeep of its grounds.''Hazards''– Very shallow water (literally below knee-deep) and solid reef. Chaotic crowds of people scrambling and boards being flung.''Beach Info –''Beach access by vehicle is either through the Hilton resort or a road under construction, which has a lot of loose stones bikes can easily skid on. Cars must be left at the top of the hill as there is no space to park at the bottom. At night there’s no light, so it’s best to make it back to the main road before dark.''Mushroom Rock''Inside Nusa Dua complex at the entrance to “Water Blow”, it’s the first break on Nusa Dua beach situated on the right hand side of the park. Similar to Nikos, there are a few sections of wave that break within metres of each other. All have reef bottoms, but on mid to high tide, water becomes deep and it’s fine to surf without worrying too much.''Mushroom rock is situated on a huge stretch of beach that has countless numbers of hotels, restaurants and beach cafes, all of which are neatly tucked into the back-end of the beach. The endless stretch of sand elegantly weaves along the coastline, and has steep banks running horizontally from the water’s edge up to the paved walkway in front of tasteful chalets above. Thick green flora and fauna, and perfectly aligned palm trees create natural shade up from the ocean. The water is so unbelievably clear, a bright, transparent blue, allowing to see plenty of colourful fish and an array of aquatic plants that are better than what can be seen on paid snorkelling tours!''Hazards –''coral reefs, hollow waves, fast closeouts on low tides. Sea urchins hiding in the coral reef with long venomous spikes can nastily pierce and stick to the skin, creating a strong burning sensation. Remove the spike immediately and bathe in urine to disinfect!''East Coast of Bali – Serangan & Sanur''The Eastern coast of Bali is characterized by fine, black volcanic sand and small, shiny, jet black pebbles scattered all over the water’s edge. All the beaches along this coastline have hard, dark, concrete like reefs cemented firmly into the ground with little growth of algae and other marine plants seen in the Bukit region. The black sand becomes extremely hot as the Sun glazes down in full power from around 9am onwards, but its easy to seek refuge from heat under the lush green vegetation and tall palm trees that run all the way along the back of the beach. The sea water appears dark and murky but over the ledge of the reef, a few metres off the shore, the ocean becomes a tropical mix of deep blue and bottle green colours blending together between their patches.''Looking out to sea, Nusa Lembongan Island sits gloriously with its big mountains covered in dense, tropical forest. On a clear, sunny day, the island seems extremely close as it’s possible to see houses and other buildings built up on the mountain side. On Bali island itself, Mount Agung, the highest volcano, and other mountains and volcanoes make a picturesque landscape and unforgettable view/ backdrop.''Serangan''Serangan means Turtle Island in English, and is the first surfable beach reached when you exit the Mandara Toll Road Bridge either from Nusa Dua or Denpasar. It’s the easiest wave in this region with easier take off, breaking in an A frame both left and right and sand bottom. Bigger swell brings in pretty sizable waves and not suitable for beginners. Even on small days, try not sit too far to the left as it is a more hollow break, reef bottom and occupied by more advanced surfers, including heaps of locals.''One has to travel a few kilometres down a wide, dusty, bumpy road to reach the beach and surf break. It is usually very crowded with scooters flying past in all directions, cars weaving between the potholes and bikes, big groups of families with surfboards, body boards and fishing rods, and clusters of warungs and surf schools that line the beachfront upon arrival. The gravel road, once you reach the end of the straight, continues hugging the coastline for over a kilometre in the direction of Sanur, where there are even more warungs and beaches to sit on. Eventually you will reach a point of no return by car or bike, but if interested, possible to explore by foot.''Hazards –''(Avoid) Serangan Reef due to hard floor and faster breaking waves, big swell means big waves and a NO NO for beginners! Big crowds, especially over weekends. Avoid Sundays in particular, and mid to high tide is always recommended for learning.''Optimum surfing conditions for beginners –''2-4ft, mid to high tide, Monday to Friday.''Beach Info –''Entry R for scooters. As soon as you have paid, take the road in the middle, heading straight where therefee is only 2,000 ID is tree cover and the widest road. You may think you have missed it or driven too far, but keep driving until the very end as Serangan is only place at the end of the road. It’s a good 10-15 minute drive on a scooter from where you pay entry to the actual beach itself.''Sanur''A\xa015-minute drive North from Serangan, Sanur has epic right peeling waves that break off the reef about 150/ 200m out from the shore. This spot should only be paddled out as a beginner when the swell is around 3-4ft max. Any bigger and it becomes a more advanced peak and probably a little scary and dangerous for someone still in the initial stages of learning to surf. Translucent water appears both green and blue, with splendid backdrops of Nusa Lembongan in the far distance looking out to sea, and numerous volcanoes covering Bali.''Hazards''– Sharp reefs, shallow water on low tide, big barreling waves in big swells.

It’s so lush and green, with jungles along the crater rim and green grasses in an otherwise savannah-like Rift Valley, it’s no surprise they chose this name.''The crater is the''world’s largest''inactive, intact, and unfilled volcanic caldera, and was named\xa0of one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa.''Approximately 25,000 animals live in the crater, and it is one of the''best places in Tanzania''to see the critically endangered black rhino.''On a personal level, after going on''Safari in Namibia'',''Botswana'', and''Zambia'', I have to say this is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever searched for wildlife, and other than Etosha in Namibia, the only place where I’ve seen wild black rhinos. I\xa0saw four, to be exact.''The crater is also home to one of the\xa0the densest known population of Masai lions, which I\xa0saw as well, playing in the grass.''This was due to a combination of being lucky and doing a few key things right – though mostly the latter. These are my tips for seeing the best of the best in the Ngorongoro Crater:''You can see it in a day''Zebras hanging with zebras in the morning light''If you’re planning out a Tanzania trip and want to see the''Serengeti''too (and you should!) and are wondering where to prioritize your time, compare the size of the two.''The span of the crater as seen from above''The crater is pretty small at 8,292\xa0km''2''(3,202\xa0sq\xa0mi), and there aren’t a lot of places to hide, so the animals are everywhere, in plain sight. In almost any direction you look, you’ll see zebra, wildebeest, elephants, and if you’re lucky, lions and rhinos too. You can devote one full day to the crater, and save 2-3, or more, for some of the other parks which are much larger and have different animals, like giraffe and leopards.''Stay the night on the rim''At the Serena Lodge -what a view!''I suggest arriving at your lodging on the crater rim by the mid afternoon. This gives you a chance to watch as golden hour and then sunset come and paint the crater various hues of green and blue. It’s a beautiful sight.''There are campsites and hotels of varying luxury. I stayed at the''Ngorongoro Serena Safari Lodge''which is within the Crater Conservancy and provides breathtaking views from the stone rooms and pictured here, from the bar and dinner area:''Tea time at the Ngorongoro Serena Safari Lodge''The food was good and plentiful, they hire local Maasai to come dance in the evenings, which I like since they provide work opportunities for the local community, and rooms start from the low $200s per night, which is a pretty decent rate for\xa0the crater!''Go early (seriously!)''We saw these guys shortly after the sun rose''We left the hotel at 5:55am for our game drive into the Ngorongoro Crater, and it was the best decision we could have made! Later in the day three things happen: The animals get lazy and tired and try to hide from the heat, more and more cars arrive so the crater gets crowded, and the light gets quite harsh for photos.''Beautiful morning light''We got lucky with lion sightings, seeing the younger lions playing around in the reeds and the water. Later in the day, they were considerably less animated, sleeping under rocks and in the ravines, enjoying the shade.''Hello, beauties''We were also lucky enough to see four black rhinos. Two were at a distance, but the other two we saw were pretty close!''Get a good guide''Checking out the hippos and this heart-shaped tree on the nice and new African Horizons truck''We booked our guide, Francis with''African Horizons'', as well as our hotel and car through''Perfect Africa'', which organizes tours all over Africa.''Francis was essential to our trip because he knows how to spot the animals. It was also at his suggestion that we went super early in the morning. He took this very seriously, making sure that we were the very first people in the gate.''He also had a radio that allowed him to communicate with the other drivers so that if they spotted something, he would know where to go.''Spotted Wildebeest and their babies early in the morning (and all day long, they love the crater)''It was usually him letting everyone else know what we’d found, though, because we had been the first in the crater and he’s so great at his job. Ask for him when you book with Perfect Africa and you won’t be disappointed!''And let him drive''Elephants crossing in the Crater''Like the Serengeti, you can self-drive the crater if you really want to. You’re looking at a $300 vehicle fee (if it’s foreign-registered like the one we’re driving is) plus the $70 per person park fees for the privilege, though.''I’m normally not a tour person, but the downside to doing the crater on your own is you don’t have the pop-up top that allows you to stand and get a 360-degree view of the crater and animals, so you’re fighting each other for window space.''Checking out buffalo on the way into the crater''We’d read in forums that the roads are also terrible, which I can confirm are incredibly true. They might be among the worst in Tanzania, which is honestly quite a feat since many of the roads are barely even roads, so you’ll spend more time worrying about the car than enjoying what you’re seeing if you self-drive.''Talk to the guide about what you want to see the day before''A baby elephant nursing in the early morning''Let your guide know what you want to see the most so that he knows what to prioritize when you enter the crater. We wanted to see rhinos, so he made that priority number one from the get-go. He also knew that we really wanted to see hyenas, because for whatever inconceivable reason they just appear to be really cute to me.''I know one shouldn’t and can’t hug a hyena, but how can someone with a face like this really be a villain in the''Lion King,''I ask you?''How sweet, right?''The face only a mother could love?''He was so knowledgable about the area and the animals as well, and he even brought along his own camera with a 300mm zoom lens so that we could shoot with it in case ours broke or weren’t long enough.''A jackal! (Are you sure you’re not a fox, sir?)''He had a pair of binoculars as well, which we were really excited to have along for the rhinos.''You don’t have to eat at the picnic areas''Flamingoes and white flowers''There are designated picnic areas where you can go and have your breakfast and lunch, sometimes with a little plaid table cloth over the hood of the car, if you fancy, but we had an even better breakfast view.''We stayed in the car and ate our packed breakfast while watching the rhinos. I can honestly say that’s the coolest breakfast view I’ve ever had!''A couple of bird brains''Another incentive for eating in the car is the aggressive birds. Every now and then, they make off with some of the tourist’s food and some are even brazen enough to grab your food right out of your hands! These are huge birds, and you don’t want those talons to meet your face.''I much preferred watching a rhino and all kinds of awesome hoofed animals from the car instead.''Dang he’s big''In all, we spent rougly 24 hours between the crater rim and the crater itself, arriving in the afternoon, enjoying an evening on the rim watching the stars come out, and descending into the crater early in the morning to see the best that it had to offer.

The Serengeti is also home to''2 million wildebeests, 900,000 Thomson’s gazelles and 300,000 zebras as the dominant herds''(via the Unesco World Heritage site)''. The Serengeti is also hosts many other herbivores including; “7,000 elands, 27,000 topis, 18,000 hartebeests, 70,000 buffalos, 4,000 giraffes, 15,000 warthogs, 3,000 waterbucks, 2,700 elephants, 500 hippopotamuses, 200 black rhinoceroses, 10 species of antelope and 10 species of primate.”''That’s a boat load, no, more than a boat load, of animals!''And giraffes!''Indeed, the magic of the Serengeti is difficult to describe in words, which is why you see me reduced to referencing children’s movies and songs. The\xa0landscape of vast plains and a scattered outcropping of rocks (Kopjes ) here and there that was originally formed by volcanic activity is vast and diverse like few places on the planet.''When looking out at the Serengeti it’s easy to see why the''Maasai'',''who are the native inhabitants, know it as ‘Siringitu’ – \xa0the place where the land moves on forever.''The''Serengeti''region spans over 30,000 square kilometers and encompasses the Se''rengeti National Park itself, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Maswa Game Reserve, the Loliondo, Grumeti and Ikorongo Controlled Areas, as well as the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.''How to Budget it''The part I visited was the Serengeti National Park and some of the surrounding conservation areas, sleeping just outside the park at the''Simba Serengeti''Lodge which is a tented lodge with a killer view.''Perfect sundowner spot''In the \xa0Serengeti, as with all of Tanzania, you can spend a metric ton of money on a safari, or you can go the extreme budget route taking a local bus and skirting the outsides without going in, or something in between.''I opted for that something in between because I wasn’t about to go all the way to the Serengeti and not go in with a proper safari vehicle!''My safari tent at Simba, with a proper roof, an outdoor shower (which I LOVED), bathtub, and a view of the Serengeti''While I’m a huge fan of doing things independently (I’m traveling through East Africa at the moment with a couple of others\xa0who are self-driving in their 4×4), we ditched the truck for this adventure for a few reasons: The roads are insanely bad in the Serengeti and we didn’t want to pop a tire, you really want a guide with you who knows how to spot animals, and the safari vehicles with the pop-up top are way better for viewing.''What the safari vehicle looks like''Once we got there, we saw zero other self-drivers, thereby confirming we’d made the right choice.''Most people book a package, including a full-board few nights at a lodge, a safari vehicle with a driver, and maybe even a bush flight into the park to save time, and to have a killer view:''An overhead view of Lake Manyara during the bush flight. We saw some of the great migration from the air, too!''Safari packages can cost tens of thousands of dollars per person on the high end, closer to several hundred dollars per day in the mid-range (which is what Simba is, and what I did), and can be more like a day tour departing from Arusha if you’re on a tight budget but still want to enter the park. There’s no bush camping in the Serengeti, as it’s a National Park, but there are campsites with amenities.''How to save money''There are a few clever ways that you can spend less money during your trip, such as staying on the outskirts of the Serengeti in the conservation areas for some of the trip. The park fees cost just over $70 per person per day at the time of this writing, but the animals don’t know what is in the park and what isn’t, and you’ll find just as many animals in the conservation areas, and far fewer people.''We took the truck out and saw a family of elephants crossing a river and then the road right in front of us, escorting their two-month-old baby along the way.''This was magical''Many of the lodges, such as the Simba Serengeti Lodge, are located on the outskirts, so you can still stay in the vicinity of the park, see animals from your room (I saw a giraffe!), and hang out in the pool in the hot afternoons, all enjoying the Serengeti without having to pay to be in it.''Loved chilling in here during the day''In the conservation area, you can also get out of the vehicle (when it’s safe, of course), and do things like a bush breakfast.''Pretty cool having breakfast with zebras in the background''You can also book during the low season, which is right in the middle of the rainy season in April, or before the great migration begins in January and February. This is known as the green season in the Serengeti, when the dry and golden plains grasses turn more lush.''It’s not always green''You can get amazing lightning storms in the rainy season. This was taken at the end of February.''Nearby areas worth exploring''As mentioned earlier in the post, there are several areas that make up the Serengeti and several other national parks nearby as well. The Ngorongoro Crater, for example, is famous for Black Rhino sightings and Lake Manyara National Park has beautiful flamingos.''Tarangire National park also has plenty of wildlife, from monkeys to elephants and all kinds of species in between. Swimming in the pool just on the outskirts of the park, I saw a herd of male elephants walk by.''Hey guys! Welcome to the pool party''Spotting them from my room''Most of the time, when people come visit the Serengeti, they book safaris in these neighboring parks as well.''Might as well if you’ve come all the way to Tanzania, right?''All in all, I spent about 10 days in the Serengeti National Park, the crater, and the surrounding areas. Each day I saw something different and wonderful, including the big five: buffalo, lions, leopard, elephants, and rhinos.''The viewing platform at Tarangire Simba Lodge''So if you’re going on a safari in the Serengeti and want to do it right with a mid-range budget, get a few of your friends, rent a big safari vehicle with a driver, and hop around a few of the lodges to see it all. I like Simba for this because the price is right, the food is really good and healthy, the service is great, the rooms are super clean and the beds are comfortable, they have outdoor showers (and I LOVE me an outdoor shower), and they all have pools and nice views.''At the Karatu Simba Lodge''If you share the safari tented rooms, share the car, and enter the parks for one day each and spend the rest of the time on the outskirts, you’ll see plenty, spend less, and still be comfortable and happy with the experience.

Africa is\xa0sweltering\xa0and us west coast\xa0gals may be tempted to wear crop tops and daisy dukes, but dressing on the conservative side (covered shoulders, knees and no bare midriff) is truly no sacrifice to\xa0make if you wear something lightweight. Take the opportunity to experiment with twirl-worthy maxi dresses and fun long sleeves.''Long-sleeve maxi dresses to rock this spring:''Floral Maxi''from Forever 21 ($28) or this''Enchanted Floral Maxi''from Needle & Thread (my current obsession).''Less is more''The ultimate takeaway most of us westerners take away from rural and developing parts of Africa (poverty inflicted regions excluded) is the incredible experience of witnessing people live life happily with hardly anything.

After about 12 hours in Africa, you will abandon your materialistic and needy self and feel good in your own skin – sans makeup, hair up or wavy, and\xa0a lightweight dress you’re obsessed with.''Match the vibrant culture''Ditch neutrals, whites and blacks – there is nothing less than vivacious and colorful in Africa. Embrace risque patterns that would normally garner skeptical looks in your own city. Judgement isn’t a thing in Africa, and even on those rare occasions where made, it certainly isn’t over anything as trivial as fashion choices. Be bold, be loud, be you – Africa is the place to do it.''Create\xa0your own clothes''Have you ever dreamed of custom tailoring your own dress? While this wasn’t at all on my itinerary, Stone Town (Zanzibar’s must-visit historical city) is brimming with fabric vendors for prices that will forever put your daily Starbucks run into perspective. I brought with me a jumpsuit from Antropologie that cost more than I’d like to admit. Upon discovering the irresistible fabric selection and the in-house tailor at my resort, I had a copy made that cost around two Starbucks lattes.

I told him that in some parts of the country, it is quite cold. He seemed satisfied with those answers.''Then I offered him one of the 20 or so mangoes we’d bought from a roadside vendor for about $1.50, and he was so excited that he hugged me – twice.''We’d come a long way that day from the humid heat and''light blue waters of the coast''to the mountains that we’d been seeing in the distance for so long. The heat made way for cooler temperatures as we climbed meter after meter into Lushoto in Tanga, Tanzania, watching the arid ground turn into red farmland before settling at a quaint little farm lodge called''Irente Farm Lodge''.''Now all over Southern and Eastern Africa, I’ve become very used to friendly, curious people and in particular, children running out to say hello, but Lushoto\xa0seemed to be on another level.''As we walked on several of the those red dirt roads seeking views from up above, it wasn’t just children who excitedly ran to the road to say “Jambo!” (Hello in Swahili), but the adults as well who would say hello and, “Karibu” (welcome).''It really is the nicest thing when people warmly welcome you as an outsider.''Our quest was to see what was rumored to be one of the best views in Tanzania. This took us up a few mud and dirt roads, climbing in the sun and thankful for the light breeze. I had a feeling that we wouldn’t see much. The crop burning had made the sky a hazy brown, so milky you could barely see through it into the distance.''However we did find a nice patch of ferns, and some dramatic rock formations.''Fern Gulley! (Pic by''The World Pursuit'')''Later in the day, we tried again, walking to the Irente viewpoint for sunset. Just then, the sky opened up and in what seemed like no time at all, went from a sporadic drop here and there to a full on monsoon.''The rainy season was starting in east Africa, after all.''That night a solid sheet of water came down for two hours, leaving me wondering how good my tent really was as I hunkered down in the farm lodge, running out into the rain to stir the dinner we were cooking over a wood fire in a covered area outdoors from town to time. Of course,\xa0the other campsite guard insisted on helping me build the fire and helped watch the poike (stew) as it bubbled for a couple of hours. Don’t worry, he got a helping of stew and a nice tip.''The next morning I awoke mostly dry, and we decided to make a last-ditch effort to see the viewpoint.''Third time’s a charm. The rain had cleared all of the smoke and I’m happy to report, the view is truly spectacular.''The viewpoint is easy to access from the farm on foot. It takes about 20 minutes to walk there, give or take, or you can drive there in about 5 minutes if you have a car.''You’ll arrive at the Irente Cliff Lodge, and you can either pay 1000 TZS (about 50 cents USD), to cut out some of the walk and go through the lodge lobby, or you can bypass it and walk in from lower down on the road. Either way, it costs 2000 TSZ to gain access to the viewpoint, which is advertised as going to the village.''Be careful up there. It’s a sheer drop from the rocks above, and as you can see, that would be one long fall!''We left town that day a lighter in spirit, thankful to have been welcomed so warmly by everyone in town, including the guard at the bank who vigorously shook my hand and even escorted me to the machine to draw my cash out, smiling the whole time.''This is potentially one of my biggest reasons for loving Africa so much – the warmth and hospitality. Yes, the people are poor and desperate and some heckle tourists for money (wouldn’t you in their position?) but when it comes down to it they are kind, curious, and ever the most gracious hosts.''Lushoto, you were beautiful in so many ways.''Do it yourself:''Get there: Drive in on your own or if taking public transport, Take any bus bound for Moshi/Arusha and get off at Mombo. It takes about 4.5 hours from Dar es Salaam. Then take a Dala (local mini van bus) up to Lushoto which should take roughly one hour and cost 2500 TZS.''Stay: I camped at Irente Farm Lodge which is slightly out of town, and it set me back 15,000 TZS per night. They also have rooms and delicious food with cheese, bread, and jam that they make onsite.''See: There are several waterfalls and national parks that you can enter only with a guide, which the farm lodge can arrange.

And like most major European cities, Brussels has lots of youth hostels, making it easy to meet people.''While in Brussels, don’t miss out on the food – be sure to sample the fries, waffles, mussels, and world-famous Belgian beer.''Check out the striking Grand-Place, a UNESCO world heritage site that was once the meeting place of Flemish guilds.''Brussels also has incredible street art, with gigantic and colorful street art murals around every corner.''Switzerland''Gorgeous Zermatt, Switzerland''We both pick: Switzerland is a great destination for solo female travelers in summer or winter. In summer, go hiking, paragliding, or mountain-climbing in adrenaline-obsessed Interlaken or hike around the Matterhorn in Zermatt.''In winter, enjoy winter sports in ski towns like''Davos Klosters'', Grindelwald, or Gstaad. Lift tickets are cheap compared to North American prices, and the Alpine ambiance is lovely. (Fondue, anyone?)''Snow-shoeing and tobogganing on an old-fashioned sled are also great winter activities in Switzerland.''Recommended destinations:''Gimmelwald, Interlaken, Grindelwald, Zermatt, Davos Klosters.''While this is by no means an exhaustive list, these are a few of our favorite places in Europe for when we’re solo. However there are tons of places worth checking out all over Western and Eastern Europe which can be safe, fun, and great places to meet others. Get out there and explore (then comment and tell us your favorites!).''Want even more?''Here’s a list from a bunch of solo female travel experts on their favorite places in Europe.''How to meet others\xa0while traveling solo in Europe''Hot air ballooning with friends in Germany''Europe draws a lot of solo travelers because of the reasons we’ve pointed out before: It’s compact, easy to get around, it’s famous all over the world for its amazing art, cathedrals, food, and mix of cultures. It’s also generally an easy place to travel through and has a great hostel culture.''According to Ashley: \xa0When traveling by yourself in Europe, strangers will ask, “Are you traveling alone?”''Followed by other questions such as:''“Want to come by the pub tonight?”''“Want to stop by tomorrow for coffee, on the house?” and/or''“My friend’s having a party Wednesday, did you want to come?”''Because you’re alone, locals will be more likely to take you under their wing and offer to show you around. Plus, it’s much easier to accommodate one guest than it is two or three.''As an extrovert, I love meeting people while traveling. So when I travel alone, I try to meet as many people as possible. A solo trip completely alone would be hell for me.''Over the years, I’ve found the the best ways to meet people while traveling solo in Europe is by staying in hostels or''Couchsurfing''(just be sure to pick people with lots of reviews, or attend the meetings without actually staying with anyone first.)''Staying in hostels is a great way to both save money and meet people. Before staying in a hostel, I check on sites like''hostelworld.com''to see if it has a common area or throws parties, both of which bode well for meeting others.''Keep in mind that the European backpacking crowd tends to skew younger. If you’re staying in hostels, prepare to meet a lot of study abroad students.''If you decide to Couchsurf, your host will most likely show you around town and introduce you to people. Plus, you’ll get exposure to the local culture and possibly have a richer experience!''Note from Kristin: I’ve also been told by a few solo female traveling friends that while in Europe, they’ve used Tinder to meet up with others, even platonically. Just be upfront about exactly what you’re looking for before meeting up.''How to stay safe while traveling solo in Europe''Hanging out in South Tyrol, Italy''Overall, Europe is very safe but it’s important to take some safety precautions. In general,\xa0places in Europe can even be safer than big cities in the US since most countries have outlawed guns and generally, assaults are few and far between, especially as they pertain to tourists (you can find stats by country''here'').''While traveling alone in Europe, take the same safety precautions you would anywhere else:''Don’t walk home alone at night (especially not with headphones!),''Don’t drink too much alcohol, especially alone''Carry a photocopy of your passport (or have a digital copy).''Carry photocopies of your credit cards (or have a digital copy).''Travel with at least two credit or debit cards (and at least one of each), and also keep an emergency stash of money in your backpack (no more than $100-200).''Leave your passport at the front desk of the hostel or lock it up in their security deposit boxes.''Don’t be too trusting of fellow travelers at a hostel. If there is a locker available, pay to lock your valuables.''Make sure the taxi driver has the meter on and is a marked, legal taxi. He or she can’t legally charge you if the meter has not been turned on, but it’s better to request it up front than risk a confrontation.''Use a''theft proof bag and\xa0purse''. A cross-body purse is not only harder for thieves to pull off of your body but is also great when you’re carrying a backpack, and locking zippers are a wallet-saver as well. Thieves in Europe are super quick and tend to be able to do their worst before you even notice, so beat them to it by bringing bags that they can’t infiltrate.''Don’t give to beggars even though it’s tempting. In doing so you reveal the location of your wallet, which can lead to trouble.''What to Pack''At Lago di Braies in Italy''Generally, what you wear and love at home will also work for you in Europe, as long as you consider the time of year. Also, unless you’re at a beach, flip-flops are generally not a good choice on those cobblestone streets. Closed-toed, comfortable shoes are your friend in Europe!''Here are a few of my packing lists to help you prepare for some of the types of weather you might encounter:''Iceland (for any time of year)''Europe in the Fall''Europe in the winter''(and how to do it''carry-on only!'')''Ski trips''Long-term Living and Working Abroad in Europe''Ashley Abroad''Americans, Canadians, Australians, Kiwis, and many others get a 90-day Schengen visa upon arrival in Europe.

In her words:''Au pairing is an excellent way to explore Europe. For reference, an au pair is a young woman (or man!) who takes care of a family’s children in exchange for room and board. Au pair duties usually include childcare, cooking, and tidying up.''I was an au pair in France four times and absolutely loved it.

It could be tucked down a quiet alley in Bangkok. It could be smack in the middle of noisy Old Town Hanoi, from a cart on the street. Sometimes it’s\xa0at high-end establishments, replete with white tablecloths and clinking champagne flutes.''Pin me!''In Southeast Asia, however, the best meals are\xa0usually at the most humble of eateries: a street cart, a fluorescent-lit dining room with plastic chairs, or a roadside shack with a hand painted sign. This part of the world doesn’t care about ambience — it’s all about''flavor''. And Southeast Asian cuisine brings the flavor in spades. It’s difficult to narrow down such a breadth of culinary choices into one small list, so here I''focus on the lesser-known specialties from each country''. Here are the top ten meals in Southeast Asia:''The Top Ten Meals in Southeast Asia''1. Banh Xeo — Crispy Pork and Shrimp Pancake — Vietnam''Photo:''Anthony Tong Lee'',''Creative Commons''I have''raved ad nauseum''about this simple-yet-delicious Central Vietnamese meal, and I’m about to do it again. Banh Xeo brings it all: contrasting textures, hearty and satisfying flavor, and a dash of freshness. Juicy shrimp and hearty minced pork are fried in a wok, then\xa0stuffed into a gorgeously crispy rice-and-turmeric shell. Bean sprouts and fresh herbs punctuate the savoriness, giving it a lift that keeps you coming back for more. Wrap it up in a rice paper, dip it into briny''nuoc cham'', and you’ll have a flavor explosion that will linger in your memory for years to come.''Where to Find It'': It’s a specialty of''Hoi An'', but you can also find it on menus in Hanoi and Saigon.''2. Babi Guling — Slow-Roasted Pork — Indonesia''Photo: Rollan Budi,''Creative Commons''It was a toss up between Indonesia’s''babi guling''and the Philippines''lechon baboy''— both slow-roasted pork dishes are''delicious.''I gave it to''babi guling''for a couple of reasons: consistency and spice. In the Philippines, the best place to get''lechon''is in Cebu, where the Sprite-soaked crispy skin is a piece of crackly heaven. But outside of that island, it can be hit-or-miss.\xa0The Indonesian dish not only includes the same ingredients all over the island, but it also packs in several layers of spice. Sweet spice from ginger, galangal, and lesser galangal. Earthy spice from fresh turmeric and black peppercorns. And fiery spice from loads of birdseye chilis. In addition to the briny\xa0shrimp paste that pervades all things Balinese, it obliterates all corners of your palate.''Where to Find It:''In mostly-Muslim Indonesia, it’s hard to find pork outside of Bali. There are several famous''babi guling''restaurants throughout Bali and the Gilis. You can check out''more Indonesian dishes here''.''3. Khao Soi — Crispy Noodle Curry — Thailand or Laos''Some call it a curry, some call it a soup. It’s true nature is entirely dependent on where you’re eating it. In Laos, it’s a clear-broth soup with egg or rice noodles and minced pork. But in Northern Thailand it achieves legendary status. A coconut milk and turmeric sauce cradles pillowy-soft cooked''and''crispy-fried egg noodles, giving a texture bite that most curries are missing. Fried shallots bring a hint of sweetness, fried chilis a hit of tempered spice. A shot of lime rounds everything out with just enough tang to lift everything up from “just another meal” to “one of the best meals I’ve ever had.” Usually served with chicken or beef, you’ll have a hard time not eating this every day.''Where to Find It:''This dish is a staple of Northern Thailand — good luck finding it in the south, or anywhere outside of the country.''Chiang Mai''‘s restaurants are a fun way to find your favorite version of this dish, but it can be found in''Pai'',''Chiang Rai'', and other Northern Thai cities.''4. Fish Amok — Fish Curry — Cambodia''A pretty package: Fish Amok''Poor Cambodia. It’s so often overlooked as a culinary destination in Southeast Asia. Yes, Cambodia is\xa0sandwiched between spicy Thailand and French-influenced Vietnam. But it has plenty to offer the hungry traveler,''if only they knew where to look''. And nothing is a better testament to the cuisine than Fish Amok. If you like your sweet with hit of tart, you’ll fall in love with the thick, almost custard-like sauce that forms the base of this dish. The ginger-galangal-turmeric\xa0trifecta is back, ground down into a paste. Into all this spicy, earthy goodness, tart lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves create the perfect tart tang to cut through it. A little hint of chili a splash of coconut milk round everything out. Tossed into a banana leaf with freshwater white fish and steamed until done, it is perfection on a plate.''Where to Find It:''You will find this dish on menus all over Cambodia, no need to make a special trip for this one!''5. Chili Pan Mee — Stir-Fried Wheat Noodles — Malaysia''This iconic noodle dish is served two ways: wet or dry. Both are excellent, but the dry version really speaks to my soul. Thick, hearty wheat noodles are smothered in a just-fiery-enough caramelized chili sauce. This is then topped with seasoned minced pork, crispy fried shallots, dark and light soy sauce, and crispy-fried anchovies. Yes, anchovies. It sounds gross, but they lend the''perfect''umami\xa0crunch to offset the fiery chili. Many places also serve this with a poached or soft-boiled egg — break the yolk, shovel it down, and thank the universe that you are a human with tastebuds.''Where to Find It:''The best place to find this is in Kuala Lumpur — there are several restaurants and food stalls in the markets that offer it.''6. Som Tam — Green Papaya Salad — Thailand''Photo: Takeaway,''Creative Commons''The Thais are dedicated to exploring all the components of flavor in each dish, and they don’t skimp when it comes to their salads. This salad also isn’t your typical lettuce-based “rabbit food” (though I have no issue with salads that are!). The base of''som tam''is shredded unripe papaya. Despite this fruity base, the papaya really acts as a stand-in for lettuce — it’s not packing a load of flavor. What''is''packing in that flavor? The dressing — what else? Fish sauce and shrimp paste are giving you briny savory flavors, chili brings the heat, lime loads up tartness, and a little palm sugar tempers all of it with some sweetness. In Thailand, you can request a spice level that you’re comfortable with, so go big or go home.''Where to Find It:''Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere. It’s on menus in every location I’ve been to in Thailand, though it is more popular in the south.''7. Chili Crab — Whole Crab in Chili-Tomato Sauce — Singapore''Photo: megawatts86,''Creative Commons''Despite it’s name, this dish isn’t usually packing''intense''heat. The base of the sauce is tomato and chili, but just how much fire you’ll be getting depends on the restaurant and how you order. No matter where you go, one thing is certain: It’s gonna get messy. Chili crab is whole mud crab (read: uncracked) drenched in a tomato-ginger-garlic-chili concoction so generous it’s almost like soup. You’ll reach in, crack your crab, and end up with fingers covered in the stuff. Fortunately, this sauce is so good that it’s served with loads of steamed Chinese buns to soak it all up. Note: It is perfectly acceptable to lick your fingers when the buns run out.''Where to Find It: There are several restaurants scattered throughout Singapore worth exploring —''this post''gives a good overview.''8. Crispy Pata — Deep-Fried Pork Knuckle — The Philippines''I may have passed over the Philippines for their''lechon''(it was a difficult decision), but I had to give props to crispy pata. If there is one Asian country that really knows how to cook a pig, it’s the Philippines. Another characteristic of Filipino food? They waste''nothing.''Every part of an animal is used, from it’s innards to it’s blood — just Google the street food Betamax. Fortunately, crispy pata is one of the more tantalizing variations of this resourcefulness: a deep-fried pork knuckle. It’s buttery goodness and crackly skin is complemented with an uber-Filipino soy-vinegar dip that sends the whole concoction rocketing into the stratosphere of deliciousness.''Where to Find It:''The Filipinos are foodies — which means restaurants all over the major cities will offer this. Do a little research wherever you are and you’re guaranteed to find a great spot.''9. Bahn Mi — Pork and Paté Sandwich — Vietnam''Okay, I know I promised you the more obscure dishes in Asia. But I''can’t''leave off this Vietnamese classic baguette sandwich — it is just''too''good to ignore. This beautiful mashup of French and Vietnamese cuisines results in nothing but wins for your tastebuds. Start with a pillowy, fresh-baked baguette, cut in half. Slather\xa0some rich, buttery paté generously on one side of the bread. Pile on plenty of juicy, smoky barbecued pork. Top this with fresh julienned carrots, daikon, cucumber, and cilantro. Then pop on a healthy amount of diced red chilies, sandwich it together, and get ready to get your mind blown. There are several variations of this throughout Vietnam, with chicken, egg, cheese, and more. But sometimes you just can’t beat the original. The best part? They’re cheap as chips — perfect for a budget traveler!''Where to Find It:''Almost anywhere you go will have a banh mi shop or street cart, but our''Vietnamese Food Guide''has several excellent suggestions throughout the country.''10. Beef Rendang — Caramelized Dry\xa0Beef Curry — Indonesia or Malaysia''Photo:''su-lin'',''Creative Commons''The ingredients list for Rendang is half a mile long, and it shows in the complex all-star Indonesian curry. The inclusion of exotic spices like cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon really bring a new level of depth to Indonesian all-stars like ginger, garlic, chili, and lemongrass. Ever-present coconut milk is generously heaped in with the spice paste. All of these flavors are stewed down until they are completely absorbed by the beef – a process that takes hours. After the liquid evaporates, the exterior of the beef is caramelized, bringing the perfect smoky back note to the dish. You will never be happier to be a carnivore than when you take a bite of this one.''Where to Find It:''This dish originated with an ethnic tribe in Sumatra, so the most authentic versions start there and spiral outward. Bali and other tourist destinations have also adopted this dish onto their menus, making it more accessible.''Narrowing the list down to just these dishes was soooo difficult — I’m sure I left off one of your favorites. Which dish has you coming back to Southeast Asia again and again? What lesser-known regional dishes do you think should be on this list?

It is important to stay in central areas for easy access to attractions. Fortunately, hostels are affordable. A night in a modern facility, right in the heart of the city – such as''Comrade Hostel''– should cost around $11, during peak season.''Must see: The Red Square is the heart of Moscow, Russia and the former Soviet Union.\xa0It is perhaps the most famous capital square of any country in the world. Lined on one side by the red brick walls of the Kremlin, and another by the beautiful St. Basil’s Basilica (Open 10:00 – 19:00. Closed Wed.

Trust me, there are far too many days where all three meals consists of espresso and carbs (especially when traveling through southern Europe – croissant and pizza alert), but for the most part it’s all about setting realistic goals for your health and being consistent.''This task isn’t always easy, especially when traveling through endlessly vibrant and delicious food cultures, but making solid travel diet habits is the key to success. Here are the five steps to eating healthy while traveling:''Step 1: Stick to Colorful Foods For Breakfast''In the mornings, our dark hunger instinct usually demands we order the croissant and espresso. While this is fine on some mornings (a girl must live), opt for meals with color and fiber most mornings. Take advantage of fresh fruit stands in the local area and combine with yogurt, oatmeal or\xa0eggs. Millennial rule: The brighter it looks on Instagram, the better it is for your body.''Step 2: Take Advantage of Snacks''To prevent overeating I always keep a stash of raw almonds and dark chocolate in my purse. Whenever I feel the urge to munch or try the next delicious fried miracle from a local vendor, my almonds and dark chocolate always curb my cravings (both savory and sweet). Pick a few non-perishable snacks you love and make them a part of your travel routine.''Step 3: No Carbs After Lunch''To aid digestion and keep your diet and exercise goals in check, it’s important to give your body plenty of time to burn off carbs throughout the day. Just like at home, it’s important to avoid overconsumption of carbs late at night. Aim to eat your most carb-heavy meal for lunch so you don’t deprive yourself from culinary goodness and simultaneously prevent weight gain.''Step 4: Stick to the 80/20 Rule – and savor that 20 percent!''Deprivation doesn’t have a place in any sustainable diet\xa0— especially not a traveler’s one. Experiencing the culinary traditions of any destination contributes to your overall understanding of a culture. That’s where balance comes in. Stick to a clean\xa0diet 80% of the time but allow yourself to experiment, explore and indulge in delicious foreign temptation the remaining 20% of the time to maintain both sanity and overall travel satisfaction.''Step 5: When in Doubt, Go Local''Stick to the local food no matter where you are in the world (I learned this rule the hard way when eating Cuban food in Nuremberg). Local delicacies are often the freshest with all ingredients coming from neighboring regions. Ignore strange cravings that don’t fit into the food culture and always indulge in what the locals are eating; you won’t regret it.''About the Author:''Kortney Gruenwald of''The Modern Jetsetter''is a travel and lifestyle blogger who took the dive into brand-ownership and the entrepreneurial life in 2016.

The benefits are huge, but I’ve harped on that enough, so it’s time to let someone else tell you her story about why she became a solo female traveler, and why it has been so wonderful, in her own words.''Meet Courtney, a 25-year-old personal stylist from Orange County, California:''Who are you?''Courtney in Australia''I’m Courtney, a Southern California native who has only has one unwavering passion in life: travel. To travel far and travel wide.''I’ve always been pretty athletic and quite competitive, which fuels my adventurous nature, my need to be challenged, and my spontaneous way of living. I find value in moments and experiences, and will never tire of sunrises/sunsets, live music, and the moon. Apart from travel, you can find me drinking coffee like a''Gilmore Girl''and rereading''Harry Potter''for the 10th time.''What was the moment when you realized you were going to travel solo no matter what?''My solo travel journey is a bit unique, as it was never supposed to happen. I decided the right path for me was to go to university and complete my Bachelor’s degree before taking off, where a friend and I connected with our love of adventure and decided we would backpack through Europe together for at least a year once we graduated. We took off to London to start our journey, but after two months, my friend had a family tragedy which forced her to return home where she decided to stay and not continue traveling. It was in that moment where I had to decide “do I continue traveling solo, or do I also return home and wait to find someone else to go with?”''I had to face my fears of traveling solo and not let them stop me. It was in that moment where I was presented with an opportunity that challenged my strength. I said “I can do this,” and I did. The decision to continue traveling by myself was the best decision I have ever made, and I faced my fears everyday with the most magical and rewarding experiences because of it.''What misconceptions did you have about solo travel that you now realize were untrue?''Courtney in Cappadocia''The biggest misconception I had about solo travel is that I would have to work really hard to make friends. I quickly found out that travelers are very alike in the means of making friends, and it wasn’t very hard at all. Nearly everyone I met was kind and good-natured, and I made some of my dearest friends in the world while traveling, resulting in many visits to foreign friends and a place to stay always mutually open.''Where have you\xa0been that you think is\xa0perfect for solo female travelers?''I personally had the best time traveling in the Balkans (former Yugoslavian countries, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, etc.) as a solo female traveler. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend these places for your first travel experience, but the type of people that you meet here are primarily long-term travelers. These countries have more genuine culture and I made genuine friends more easily here and had some of my greatest travel experiences going through these areas. They are also the less explored European countries, so you’ll have so much fun in the unspoiled areas and will appreciate the history and stories the natives have to tell.''Can you tell me a story about when you were traveling solo that was just so mind-blowingly amazing that you still smile when you think about it?''Sailing in Greece''To save money, I used a tool called''Trusted Housesitters''where I would go and house/pet sit for people in their homes while they went on holiday, resulting in mutual funds saved as they didn’t have to pay me for my service and I didn’t have to pay them for their accommodation. I ended up getting along so well with one woman I house/dog sat for that I stayed an extra week after she returned home and then went with her daughter (around my age) to her university up north. I kept in contact with this wonderful woman while backpacking through Europe, and one day she sent me an email inviting me to go sailing on her yacht in Greece for two weeks with her daughter and friends. To this day, those two weeks sailing in Greece are the best two weeks I have ever had, and I fondly refer to her now as my British mum.''How did this site, help you?''Be My Travel Muse has helped me to find my identity. Through traveling solo, I discovered the cliche is true and I really did find myself. The more I read \xa0Be My Travel Muse and related to experiences and stories shared, I became more and more confident in myself, my dreams, and who I was and wanted to be. Kristin and I have similar backgrounds: both from SoCal, dreaming of a life far bigger and more adventurous than what we were living, packing it all up for an unknown destination with nothing but a backpack and a wild heart.''This blog helped me realize''I belong to the nomad community'', and if someone from my home turf can do it, I can, too.''What are some unexpected benefits of traveling alone?''The biggest benefit of traveling solo is that it’s a constant test of both character and ability that leads to discovery and growth. The more practical benefits are that I’ve learned more about finance and budgeting than I did in my classes at school or work (and I’m a business major!). You quickly learn how much you’re willing to spend and where, which made me a super resourceful person and reevaluate what I actually need, versus what I want. You learn to trust your instincts and realize how much strength you actually possess. You learn to appreciate every moment and how to truly live in the present.''The biggest benefit of traveling alone? You learn who you are. You challenge yourself every. single. day. And it’s worth it.''Courtney with a group of travel friends in the Isle of Skye in Scotland''How have you managed to make it sustainable?''I work in fashion as a personal stylist, where my entire inventory is online and all shipping and packing is done at warehouses throughout the country, so I can style my clients from my computer. When I started, my company was a start up and quite small, so I was able to build up trust with them before I started traveling (I was an employee for a little over a year before taking off). I made sure to keep in constant communication with my manager so I wasn’t letting my clients down, but that required some sacrifices on my part. For example, if I was scheduled to have a meeting at''14:00 PST''and I was in Italy, I’d be on the call at''midnight''UCT+1.''I also had a responsibility to my company to maintain my minimum hour requirement, so that means I had to designate specific times to work. As I am able to make my own schedule, I could do one hour in the morning, go exploring, and do two more hours at night. Or if I knew I was going to be traveling and my mode of transportation didn’t include WiFi, I would designate a day to working before going out and having fun. As long as I have WiFi, I can\xa0work!''You can find more from Courtney on her blog and''Instagram''.''Want more? Check out''Thia from Indonesia''‘s story. Want to do it, too?

I didn’t want to have my trip ruined by theft and I also didn’t want to have to constantly worry that someone would slash my bag or unzip it without me noticing.''I read all kinds of unsettling things that I had no idea about. Let me count the\xa0ingenious ways that thieves successfully operate before you have time to notice: They can slash your bag, cut the strap as they drive by on a motorbike, force a blunt tool into the zippers and pry it open, or of course, unzip it with lightening speed and precision and then run away. They can also steal your information by bumping into you and scanning your pockets or purse, and in a matter of seconds, they have all of your passport and credit card information.''I didn’t want that to happen to me, so I decided to invest in some good travel gear so that my camera and identity would remain with me.\xa0Most of what I found online recommended the same brand over and over – Pacsafe – so I decked myself out head to toe in their gear before I left for Southeast Asia.''They were right. It works really well! Over four years later, here’s what I still use and love:''55L backpack: Venturesafe GII''In Mozambique''with my backpack''I brought this bag to Africa with me and love that the zippers lock into place. They unlock again with a bit of pressure, but it takes time to open them and unslide the zippers from the lock, and you’d have to know how the bag works as well, which makes me a much less attractive target than someone next to me whose zippers are easy to pull. The zippers are also designed in such a way that makes them very difficult to penetrate.''It’s also lined with eXomesh, which is a fancy word for,''you can’t slash this bag because there’s metal running all through it''. It also comes with a steel locking cable so you can attach it to the metal bars on trains and busses and to unmovable objects in your room.''I’ve also found that front-load backpacks are so much easier and nicer to use than top-load. If I want to find something in my bag and it happens to be at the bottom, I don’t have to pull everything out and then organize it again. It’s also easy to adjust and fit to multiple heights and body shapes. I also love that the straps all zip inside for flights, so they don’t get snagged and broken in transit. If I’m not''traveling carry-on only'', I bring the''Venturesafe 55L''with me.''Camera bag:\xa0Camsafe V9 anti-theft camera sling pack''With my camera at Iguazu Falls in Argentina''I’ve taken this bag hiking with me all through Africa, Patagonia, and Europe – all of which are full of pickpockets. I picked this bag in particular because I like how it wraps around my body. I can be agile while I’m bouldering with my hands and feet, and the compartments inside are well-padded and designed for camera equipment. It has a rain-proof cover as well, which helped when I was walking around the very wet Victoria Falls in Zambia.''The straps on the bag have metal running through them, plus this is also lined with eXomesh, so thieves can’t slash it. It also has zippers that clip and can’t be undone in a rush, so my camera equipment doesn’t come out until I want it to. When hiking, the''V9 anti-theft camera bag''is my go-to.''Cross-body bags: Citysafe and Metrosafe''In Germany''Before I went to Southeast Asia, I read that in Vietnam and Cambodia, it’s really common for motorbike thieves to search out girls with canvas bags and cheap-looking cloth straps that they can easily slash. Before you can even react, the bag is gone and so is your passport, money, phone, and dignity. In Europe, they’ll quickly unzip your purse before you have any idea they’ve made off with your stuff. I know,''it happened to me''when I didn’t lock my zippers on my purse (stupid!), and I couldn’t believe how they’d managed it in a matter of seconds.''That’s why it’s important to have bags that look sturdy, can’t be slashed, have locking zippers, and can block RFID scanners to keep your data and money safe and secure. I’ve bought several purses in various sizes over the past 4 years from Pacsafe – the bigger''Metrosafe bag''that I could fit my DSLR camera into, and the smaller''Citysafe purse''in cranberry for when I’m in, well, cities, and want something smaller and easier to carry around. I’m testing out the cheaper and lighter''Slingsafe bag''as well now. It has fewer bells and whistles but it still has the eXomesh technology and the slash-proof straps, which is my main reason for buying these bags.''Electronics backpack:\xa0Camsafe Z16 anti-theft camera & 13″ laptop backpack''Walking with all my camera gear in''Maui''Once I upgraded to''more camera equipment'', I needed to increase the size of my backpack as well for flights, trains, and bus rides. Since my whole life and business are basically in one bag, this is the most important one in terms of technology and resilience.''I also wanted a bag that could carry my computer and was designed for camera equipment, and found the''Camsafe Z16''to be perfect for all of that. It has seperate padded compartments for each item, is made with super sturdy and thick slash-proof straps, material, and zippers, and has RFID blockers in place in the compartment meant for my passport.''Extra security: Wire mesh bag protector''This is one of my favorite items to bring along when I travel. I use it in every hostel, bamboo hut, and car trunk that my bags go into. I place all of the good stuff that I don’t want stolen in my backpack, slip the rain cover over it, and then lock this''wire mesh bag protector''over it. Sure, I guess with bolt cutters someone could still rob me, but with a bunch of other backpacks in the room that aren’t locked, I’m the least attractive target.''I can’t even count how many times I stayed in a hostel or bungalow that didn’t have lockers or a safe. Though more and more hostels are installing lockers, I’d say about half of the places I’ve traveled to, particularly in developing countries, just didn’t have lockers or safes for my stuff. The front door isn’t enough security when in a place where people can easily break in, or where the staff who works there is under pressure from local mobsters to rob tourists. For less than $100 I’ve probably saved myself thousands in stolen camera equipment. Seriously, I swear by this thing.''Happy travels!''Those are a few of my favorites from the past few years, using a brand that I’ve come to pretty much solely use and swear by.''Though I will never know\xa0how many times I would have been robbed, had a bag slashed, or had my data copied had I not had all of this technology on my side, considering that I’ve been only been robbed once (because I wasn’t following my own rules, of course), over the past 4.5 years that I’ve been largely nomadic, traveling to 6 out of 7\xa0continents on planet earth, I think it’s safe to say I’m doing pretty well.''Most of the time, petty theft is reserved for the easiest target, so by making myself less of one, I was a lot less attractive to rob. That’s the best part about these products – if you look harder to rob, you’ll get bothered less, targeted less, and will be able to worry less. For me, that’s priceless.''*Some of these links are affiliate links – there’s no extra cost to you to purchase through the link, and it helps to support this site.

Before this however, that week for us would be spent gazing over the country’s world famous rice terraces in North Luzon and getting''some awesome drone footage to match''! You may be mistaken for thinking we are in fact referring to the rice terraces of the well-documented Banaue, however, a short tricycle ride away is a much more coveted and in our opinion jaw dropping spectacle that is well worth going off the beaten path for.''To reach Banaue there are regular buses departing directly from Manila which travel for 8 hours throughout the night. A quick Google search and we found that Ohayami would provide the best price in terms of cost, comfort and reputation. We didn’t buy tickets in advance, however we were able to purchase these just a few hours before the journey from the station office located in Manila for only $8. Phew!''Having stopped several times throughout the night, we arrived into Banaue at 6am feeling surprisingly fresh! Every passenger on the coach was dropped at the tourist information office and from there all of them but us opted for crowded tour groups, paying over the odds for what we deemed to be a less authentic experience.''Heading down the line of tricycles, we found one that would take us to neighboring Batad, although our monstrous rucksacks had to be left behind at the tourist office for our return! The tricycle ride was an adventure in itself. We passed through miles and miles of rice terraces, children running alongside the tricycle, eager to see Batad’s newest visitors and chickens even daring to cross the road!''For those who\xa0are unfamiliar with the northern territory, Luzon is known as the mountain province of the Philippines and boy did we realise this as we scooted up hill. As the climb steepened, we were summoned by the driver to lean forward and help carry the tricycle up the bank. On several occasions, Charlie also had to make a quick escape out of the side door to prevent us from skidding backward the way we came! Well, he did promise my parents before we left that he would look after me.''As we travelled further toward our destination, we began to realize even more so, the real beauty and vastness that lies in this province. The rice fields draped over the hillside, rolling as deep as the eye could see. If these views prior to our arrival were\xa0anything to go by, Batad would truly be spectacular and a stark difference to our time on''White Beach in bustling Boracay!''It was only when the road came to a surprising dead end that we were informed no road existed\xa0down to our village and that the locals farmers and their crop nestled\xa0deep in the valley, along a small path that they had carved for themselves. It was at this point we realized why it was suggested we left our rucksacks behind. A mere 40 minutes later, we arrived at''Batad Transient House'', our home for the next two nights!''Like the rest of the houses in the village, our guesthouse was stood on stilts which protruded from the old rice terraces below. Made from just wood and corrugated metal, this was as authentic as you could get, especially when we realised there was no electricity during daylight hours! It was like nowhere we had ever seen before. Like most, we are always craving a room with a view; well Batad Transient House far surpassed our expectations.''In true English style, we had a good old cup of tea to wake us up before we explored the rice terraces. Ignoring the suggestion of a guide and instead opting to learn about local life through our guesthouse owner, we took to the rice terraces alone. Shaped like an amphitheater, the terraces take center stage and are a pinnacle of the community. It is amazing to roam freely, watching the local farmers go about their everyday life as they work together strenuously planting rows upon rows of seedlings.''From the top of the rice terraces to the depths of the hidden waterfall, Batad holds no end of sweet surprises and phenomena. Having crossed the central section of the terraces, we headed down the steep steps to the icy river below, dreading the return climb. Word of warning – don’t wear jeans! As we reached the rocky river bed and turned the corner, the haze of water cloaked us. A final staircase and we were face to face with the huge surge of water ahead. We attempted to regain our breath from the trek down, but the mightiness of the waterfall delayed our full recovery. Note to self: Always carry swimwear in The Philippines; you never know when you will uncover such natural beauties!''Heading back to the main path, we rejoined the staircase to the highest point overlooking the entire site. Gazing at the villages below, we were completely in awe of our surroundings. If it wasn’t for the clouds rolling past us, we would be guilty of thinking that time had stood still.''Standing alone with only the local farmers for company, this certainly beats any over inflated, over crowded and over trodden tour group. It is amazing to think that just an hour’s tricycle away from the hub lies this serene and secluded sensation. Truly a hidden gem.''About the Authors:''Charlie and Charlotte are the wanderlusting couple behind''TheWanderLovers.com''.

Photos in this post by''Backpacker Steve''I pulled into the station at Davos, a quaint little town with sparkling icicle lights strung from building to building, and alighted with the other skiers to meet a valley framed with mountains all around, and gondolas running in every which direction to take people up to the top. I imagined the view up there must be spectacular.''And the next day, I found out that yes, it is.''Getting ready to ski at Rinerhorn''Davos is a special place because while much of the rest of the Alps might have to create their own snow, it’s high in elevation and gets plenty from the sky during the ski season. While I was there we had a mix of snow flurries, blue skies, and billowy clouds. It was the Alpine winter wonderland you imagine and hope for when you picture what a perfect ski holiday might look like.''Let’s talk about the cost. Switzerland is expensive, that’s true. You’ll spend a lot on\xa0food and lodging. The lift tickets and the quality of the runs, however, beat out the US and Canada easily, where it’s just as much if not more expensive. When I was in''Idaho this winter''a lift ticket cost $140. In Davos, it’s half of that (you can also''get it cheaper by prepaying online''), and includes 5 ski areas: Parsenn, Pischa, Madrisa, Rinerhorn, and Jakobshorn.''Plus for skiing, I want lots of\xa0real snow.''Parsenn''It’s breathtaking''Parsenn is the largest\xa0ski area in Davos with 35 runs and these\xa0absolutely stunning surroundings. It’s also the most modern with the funicular, plenty of chair lifts, and gondolas.''Check out the Route 66 theme!''Apart from the runs, several of which are over 10km combined (which I think is too cool!), there’s also an igloo village that you can ski into and stay in for as little as 150 francs per night per person. It has a hot tub, sauna, and fondue. ‘Nuff said.''Pischa''Mountain biking in the snow''This mountain has one gondola that runs up every 30 minutes, and is loved for the snow-shoeing, off-piste (un-groomed slopes) skiing, and activities like air boarding and fat biking.''I fell off of my fat bike within the first three minutes and opted for air boarding after that, which is basically a little blow up pool floaty that you lay face-first on and charge down the mountain.''As an added bonus, my abs are still sore from it two days later. It’s always the best when you don’t even realize you’re getting a workout, you’re having so much fun.''Rinerhorn''Let’s shred''I loved the Rinerhorn for the view, the smaller crowds, and for being the first place where I learned to embrace the T-bar lift. While the mountain has runs in every color and suited to every level, I really appreciated the variety of blue and red runs that I was able to do with ease, some running through the trees and through truly beautiful scenery.''And some delicious local eats''They also have a sledding track that you can do during the day or at night.\xa0Believe it or not you should bring your helmet and goggles along – it’s like Mario Kart on snow. You’ll be careening down the mountain with serious\xa0speed.

Perfect way to take a ski break''I also loved the conditions on the slopes, with nice, soft snow that was easy to learn on. So far, it’s been my best skiing experience, which is probably due largely to my technique improving with more practice, but it also has to do with the quality of the snow and the availability of lots of ski runs.''So thanks, Davos, for introducing me to winter so high up in the Alps and with such lovely powder.''I’ll be back again.''Do it yourself:''Stay:''The digs''Davos is a classy ski town with mostly four and five-star hotels.

Though a 3-4 day backpacking adventure through the Drakensberg mountains would have been ideal, I had to get to Cape Town by a certain date in order to participate in a project I’ll discuss here later.''It’s the great plague of traveling and movement that there is, by nature, limited time to see everything. It seems the more I move around, the more I become aware of and the longer my must-see list grows.''Even less sensical, I go places and immediately think to myself, “when I return, I’ll do this! I’ll do that! I’ll bring so-and-so with me!”''As if in some mystical future\xa0I’ll suddenly, magically, have all this extra time that I don’t seem to have in the moment.

The warmth would have to travel through all of those layers both ways to heat the bag, so it’s less about more layers, and more about getting a bag that’s meant for the temperatures.''About critters''If you’re worried about insects and/or animals, remember that keeping your tent zipped up is the best way to keep everything out that isn’t welcome. As long as it’s a solid tent that doesn’t have holes, mosquitoes, spiders, and anything that doesn’t come in with you shouldn’t be able to get in. You can also use sage in your camp fire or''citronella candles''to ward off mosquitoes''Remember not to keep food or trash in your tent.

Meat and vegetables are fried in this spicy concoction, then coconut milk is added to give it a creamy sweetness that takes this flavor to a new stratosphere. The spice level on red curry is usually about a 3 out of 5, with just enough zip to keep it interesting.''Yellow Curry''Yellow curry gets its color from super-spices like turmeric, yellow mustard seed, and cumin, among many other things. These earthy spices counteract the less-prominent chili and blend beautifully with the sweetness of the coconut milk to create a wonderfully balanced dish. With a spicy scale of a 1 or 2 out of 5, it’s a great ‘starter curry’ for those who can’t take the heat.''Green Curry''Green curry by''Takeaway'', used under creative commons''The spiciest of them all (and my personal favorite), green curry gets its color and its heat from underripe green chilis. These are ground with all the usual curry suspects into a thick paste, but even a healthy dose of coconut milk can’t counteract all that spice. You may sometimes find this watered down to a 3 out of 5 on the spice scale, but a true green curry should be at least a 4.''Massaman Curry''This is the most unique of the curries, with spices like cardamom, cinnamon and cloves making it one of the rare Thai curries that doesn’t rely solely on chili for some heat. With Muslim origins, many attribute these unique flavors to Persian influence. This is generally made with chicken as the protein, and the surprise addition of potato makes it a hearty and satisfying meal (and a pretty decent hangover cure). Some of the best Massaman can be found in Koh Lanta, a predominantly Muslim island just a ferry stop away from Koh Phi Phi.''Panang Curry''My favorite! Many say it’s red curry sweetened with coconut milk, but my experience in the southern islands was a slightly spicier, richer version. Ground peanuts are the game-changer with this dish, creating a thicker sauce that makes this curry the least soupy of the options. So much so that you might be able to skip the rice, if you were so inclined. Sweet or spicy, this is a hearty, yummy dish that should definitely make your ‘to taste’ list when you visit Thailand.''Choose Your Soup: Tom Yum Goong, Tom Ka, Gaeng Jued''Tom Yum Goong''This tangy, savory shrimp soup is heaven in a bowl. It gets heat from chilies, a sour note from kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass, and plenty of hearty flavor from mushrooms, onions, and fish sauce. With chunks of juicy shrimp floating through all that spicy-sour goodness, you’ll want to dive into the bowl and never find your way out. Even if soup isn’t usually your meal of choice, you’ll make an exception for this one.''Tom Ka''This is Tom Yum’s creamier, sweeter cousin. Generally made with chicken instead of shrimp, it has a note of tartness from some kaffir and lemongrass, but the coconut milk is really the star of the show. With a hit of cilantro to give it a fresh lift and galangal (a stronger-flavored relative of ginger) to give it depth, it is a well-rounded comfort food meal that will keep you full all night.''Gaeng Jued''Too many curries have your belly protesting? Gaeng Jued is the answer. This is the equivalent of mama’s chicken soup, except it’s a veggie and noodle soup (vegetarians rejoice!). Compared to most Thai food, it’s pretty bland, but sometimes you need to take a break from the spice and the noodles and just eat something that’s easy on your stomach. This is your answer!''Choose Your Noodles: Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, Pad Siew, and Khao Soi''Pad Thai''If you’ve made it to Thailand without trying Pad Thai before, congratulations! You’re part of\xa0a''very''small group of people. This dish is most Westerner’s first intro to Thai food, made up of thin rice noodles laced with vegetables and chicken (or some other meat) and fried in a wok. Punchy tamarind and earthy fish sauce create a yummy balance, and peanuts, lime and loads of bean sprouts get the texture, crunch and tang that will send you to seventh heaven. Since a heaping plate of this is usually under $0.50 on the street, you’ll be loading up.''Pad Kee Mao or Drunken Noodles''The story behind this dish is a good one: One late night a man came back to his house looking for some drunk munchies. He grabbed some noodles, started to fry them up, and threw in everything in his refrigerator. Generally consisting of wide, flat rice noodles, vegetables and some form of meat, it’s the stir-fry sauce that makes this dish so yummy. Soy sauce, fish sauce, chilis and Thai basil combine to create the perfect balance of salty and spicy. Unsurprisingly, it’s a''phenomenal''late-night meal after you’ve had a few Changs. Dig in!''Pad Siew''Pad siew is another all-star fried noodle dish you won’t want to miss. Similar in many ways to Pad Thai, it features broad, flat rice noodles and a rich sauce that is dominated by dark soy and oyster sauce. It’s usually a little sweeter and a little less crunchy (the peanuts and bean sprouts are nowhere to be found on this dish), but with a hit of chili flakes it may supersede Pad Thai as your noodle dish''du jour.''Khao Soi''This Northern Thailand staple is an almost-curry, almost-noodle, almost-soup dish. Whatever you may call it, it’s 100% delicious. The base of this dish are egg noodles, boiled soft and\xa0deep-fried to delightfully crunchy crispiness. This contrast in textures is covered in a thin turmeric-heavy sauce that’s thinned out with plenty of coconut milk. Added into the mix are fried chilies, shallots, lime, and pickled mustard greens that create texture and flavor''heaven''. This ended up being my favorite new discovery on my last visit to Thailand, and it’s rarely on restaurant menus outside of the country, so don’t miss it!''Som Tam or Green Papaya Salad''Salads don’t usually make my list of ‘favorite dishes’ when I travel abroad. They’re usually more of a dietary necessity than the celebration of intense flavor.''Not so''with Som Tam, an explosion of salty shrimp flakes, loads of spicy chili, nutty toasted peanuts and a lime juice-fish sauce dressing smothered over shredded green papaya. There are so many flavors going on in this dish that your tastebuds will take a beating with each bite, but it hurts''so''good. It’s easy to find, super cheap, and so delicious that\xa0you’ll come back for more again and again.''Mango Sticky Rice''By the time dessert rolls around, I’m usually so stuffed full of curry or noodles that I can’t possibly fit another bite. On the rare occasions I can, Mango Sticky Rice is the ultimate sweet treat. It’s a very simple combo of ripe mango, glutinous rice and coconut milk. You can find it all over southeast Asia, but I personally think Thailand does it best.''Choose Your Drink: Thai Iced Coffee, Mango Shakes, Chang Beer''Thai Iced Coffee''Take super-strong coffee, pour it over a layer of sweetened condensed milk, and put the whole thing on ice. The result is a power-punch of caffeinated goodness that is the''best''way to start your day. What sets Thai coffee apart is the infusion of spices like cardamom and cinnamon into the coffee itself. Over ice, it’s the perfect way to cut that heavy Thai heat.''Mango Shakes''Mango shakes and banana pancakes are staples on the backpacker trail through Southeast Asia. Sure, they may not be''traditional''Thai fare, but they are so good you won’t want to skip it. Shake carts can be found just about anywhere there are people, and on a hot afternoon it’s just what the doctor ordered. A ripe mango, a little condensed milk, a little sugar syrup, and a lot of ice. You’ll be doing a happy dance.''Chang Beer''With it’s distinctive elephant logo plastered on tank tops, key chains, and hats, Chang is more than just the local beer. It’s a national icon. It’s an easy drinker (sometimes''too''easy, if you ask some of the backpackers on Khao San Road), it’s refreshing, and a big bottle is a great way to wash down a spicy curry. It might not win any craft brew awards anytime soon, but it gets the job done.''There is so much variety and deliciousness in Thai cuisine, this list is only the tip of the iceberg. There is no better place to get adventurous and try new flavors than in Thailand, so get ready for a culinary journey! Do you have a favorite that didn’t make the list?

Tipping is big in Canada, so sitting down at a restaurant can be expensive at $15-$35 CA. If you want to save money on food, keep your eye out for cheap sandwich shops or cook your own meals. Lastly, accommodation rates are dependent on the city you are in but expect to pay around $30 CAD for a dorm and $60 and upwards for a hotel.''United States''Pu’u Pehe in''Lanai, Hawaii''The U.S. might be one of the most expensive destinations on this list but it is also one of the destinations with the most diversity in terms of culture and natural beauty.''Almost anything you want to experience, from the tropics in''Hawaii''to the northern lights in Alaska, is on offer. The U.S. can be a fairly expensive destination because of high transportation and accommodation costs, but these costs can vary greatly from state to state\xa0with prices running highest on the coasts, in the national parks, and in Hawaii. A suggested daily budget is around\xa0$100 for decent meals, non-dorm accommodation, and transport. Travelers who prefer dorms should expect to pay about $28 for a dorm in New York or Los Angeles, but should also know that the US doesn’t have a big dorm culture. The best ways to save are to cook your own food, camp, and to''couchsurf''.''Public transport isn’t great in the US, therefore road trips are popular for most visitors, either''across the US''or on the''Pacific Coast Highway'', among others.''Mexico''Mexico has a lot to offer from gorgeous beaches along two coasts, to the vibrant culture of Mexico city and Oaxaca, and of course Mexican cuisine, which has been added to the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity List by UNESCO. Mexico is also known for its ancient Mayan ruins and tropical weather. As a result of this popularity Mexico''can be a bit more expensive''than its neighbors in Central America,\xa0even if you do skip the resorts, but it’s still much cheaper\xa0than the US or Canada. Accommodation in hostels begins at around $6 to $14 in budget hotels. For budget travelers,\xa0street food is the best option with tacos starting at $1. To travel around Mexico you can take buses using the''ADO website''and the cost ranges from $10-$40.''Central America: Cheap''Caye Caulker in Belize''Central America is a great choice for those on a budget who want to find a slightly older crowd on the road (more people in their 30s and 40s as opposed to more in their 20s in Southeast Asia). The most expensive countries to travel to in Central America are Costa Rica, Belize, and Panama. Excursions and activities such as zip lining or ATV tours in''Costa Rica''are always priced with American tourists in mind and are usually over $50. Entry to the parks for hiking without a guide will cost at least $15. In Belize, expect to pay more for diving and tours than you would elsewhere in Central America.''Conversely,''traveling to Guatemala'', Nicaragua, El Salvador, or Honduras is more affordable. Accommodation can cost as low as $10 per night, and keep in mind that local public transportation is much cheaper than private, or ‘tourist’, transportation. Food is the best, tastiest, and cheapest when exploring the local street food. In countries like Guatemala, you can enjoy a full lunch “menu del día” for $5 or less!''South America: Mid-Range''The Fitz Roy in''El Chalten, Argentina''South America really varies in cost, but it’s still generally cheaper than most of Western Europe, Oceania, and North America. Plan on spending less in the countries farther north and a lot more in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. That said, the buses are generally great, there’s camping and hostels, and varying degrees of luxury (and bang for your buck) as well.''Accommodation:''AirBnB (click for $25 off!)'',''Booking.com''Transport:''Check this guide''for bus recommendations per country.''Bolivia''Bolivia is one of the cheaper countries to travel to in South America. Accommodation costs for backpackers in dorms are cheaper than many other South American countries,''ranging from around $10-20 for dorms and $15-30 for private rooms''. Eating local meals will be cheaper (under $10) than westernized restaurants.''Public transportation is very cheap, but the quality and safety is better on tourist buses,\xa0which are more expensive. When traveling in Bolivia, the most expensive thing\xa0you’re likely to encounter is activity costs. Tours to mountain bike down the World’s Most Dangerous Road, for example, vary depending on the safety gear provided, but range from $50-100. The Bolivian visa cost for Americans is steep at $160.''Argentina''At Iguazu Falls in Argentina''Prices in Argentina tend to fluctuate thanks to an unstable currency. Sometimes, Argentina can be a great value to travel through and at other times, prices can essentially double. The black market on currency which used to make Argentina cheap is gone now, so don’t expect it to be as cheap as the glory days of yore. Hostels can run as much as $60 for a private room in popular places. Food can also be expensive, but when you’re eating delicious steak in Argentina, you just might be willing to overlook that.''Colombia''Colombia is affordable when it comes to local meals and accommodation. A typical bandeja paisa platter costs around $6-7. The menu of the day is always a tasty, affordable option as well. A nice hostel dorm can''cost as low as $12 per night''.''Colombia can get\xa0expensive for transportation on overnight buses (around $50 one-way). In some cases it is more economical to fly via VivaColombia, Colombia’s budget airline. Prices for everything in popular cities like Medellín and Cartagena (especially in the historic center) are higher than in less traveled cities. Note that tourism in Colombia is rapidly growing, so price increases should be expected year over year.''Chile''In''Torres del Paine National Park'', Chilean Patagonia''Chile’s economy is the strongest in Latin America. As such, expect Chile to be a more expensive place to visit. You can still save by camping through most of the country, ordering the menu del dia (menu of the day) for lunch, and you can even''hitchhike''through part of it pretty safely. Your budget can vary pretty wildly in Patagonia, in particular. I personally''spent an average of $53 per day''over 60 days there.''Expect places like''Easter Island''to be super expensive for food and activities, and for the middle of the country and Santiago to be mid-range with lots of accommodation levels and options.''Brazil''Brazil is one of the most expensive countries in South America. The visa entry cost for Americans is $160 USD, $65 USD for Canadians and $35 USD for Australians.''Since the 2016 Summer Olympics, prices in Rio have skyrocketed. Activities in Rio such as the Christ the Redeemer statue and Sugarloaf mountain cost around $15-20 and visiting the Brazil side of Iguazu Falls costs approximately $15-20. Accommodation in hostels ranges from $10 during low season to as much as $50-70 in high season. Traveling by buses\xa0runs from $20-80, so\xa0flights from around $80-100 may be a more efficient use of travel time for long distances considering that Brazil is such a massive country.''Meals range from $10-20''; consider the self-service option in which you can eat as much as you want for a fixed price!''Peru''Peru has the potential to be pretty affordable.''Where it can get expensive is depending on which activities you want to do and''how independently you do them''. For example, there are very expensive tours to Machu Picchu using the train and bus, but you can also travel to Machu Picchu independently and without the help of a tour for a fraction of the cost.''Day trips to Huacachina or the 2 day/1 night Colca Canyon hike are about $20-50.''Local meals and street food are the cheapest options while food in more tourist-heavy areas such as Cusco are more expensive. Lima, which is very much like any American city price-wise, is also inherently more expensive. There are many affordable accommodation options ranging from dorms to guest houses or hotels. Cruz del Sur is one of the better bus companies for the long-haul overnight journeys, but these tickets are more expensive than some of the less comfortable overnight bus companies.''Western Europe: Expensive''Near''Stuttgart, Germany''Western Europe includes the countries on Europe’s west coast from Portugal and Spain,\xa0to as far east as Germany, Italy, and Finland, and all of those in-between. This region isn’t a budget destination, but it does cater to travelers of every type from budget backpackers to high-end luxury travelers. Expect to pay about what you would in the US for most things, with some, sometimes extreme, variations.''In general, the shoulder seasons in the autumn and spring\xa0are much cheaper than summer for accommodation and activities, and as of this writing in 2017, the exchange rate is better than it has been in years at USD $1 equaling 93 cents Euro. The beauty of traveling through Europe is that while the exchange might not be as great as countries like Vietnam or Cambodia, it’s easy and comfortable thanks to the infrastructure. Plus, \xa0you can stay for a whole 3 months with no visa required for most western nationalities. While the northern countries such as Norway and Sweden can be incredibly expensive, Greece, Spain and Portugal can offer amazing rates on food and accommodation. Moving slowly and planning ahead\xa0as much as possible will cut your transportation costs, and thanks to budget airlines like''Ryanair''and''Norwegian'', airline travel between countries like Italy and Greece can be as low as $65 one way.

Local trains in Italy are also reasonable with a ticket from Rome to Bologna costing as little as $19 euros with''trenitalia''.''A daily food budget''of $25 euros ought to help satisfy a pasta craving if you only eat fancy for one meal and consider shopping at markets for bread, cheese, and wine for other meals. There is also pretty decent street food in Italy with slices of square pizza for $1.50 and even some cheap pasta places for $5 a plate. Aperitivo is also popular in much of Italy, which is a happy hour with snacks and drink discounts.

Dorm rooms in June in London start at £13, but in January start at £9.78. If you’re into museums you’re in luck as many are free, however the cathedrals, Buckingham Palace, and the Tower of London all have entry fees. The Tower and Buckingham palace together cost over £30. Public transportation in UK tends to be expensive as well. A trip from Liverpool to London can range from £25 to £150.

A sit down meal runs from $10-$20.''Albania''Just north of Greece, Albania, like Croatia, is one of Europe’s best kept secrets. On the road to recovery from a civil war in the ’90s, Albania is finally showing off her beautiful coastline. As one of the most underdeveloped European nations, Albania’s public transportation can be a bit bumpy but cheap. A bus in Tirana runs every 10 minutes on 12 routes to various cities and is 40 lek.

While there are some cities like Cairo, Egypt that can be as cheap as $18.75 USD per day, Dubai in the UAE can be over $200. Tourism has dropped due to bad press in former tourist hotspots like Turkey (which wasn’t much cheaper than countries like Greece or Spain) and Egypt, causing prices to drop there as well.

If you’re not tight on money check out any sit down restaurant and where prices can be as low as $10 or almost limitless in the other direction.''Public transportation in Dubai is fairly cheap.

Israel has a growing network of hostels with rooms starting at $20 USD. Buses are the most popular mode of travel often offering free wifi. A bus from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv is $5 USD. The quality of food is very high in Israel and can be quite affordable. Falafel is delicious and only cost about $2 USD.''Turkey''Many people view Turkey as the place where East meets West and in many ways it is. There’s even some debate as to whether or not it should be classified as European. Turkey''isn’t a particularly expensive destination'', with dorms in Istanbul starting at $10 USD\xa0and entire homes on''Airbnb''starting at $40. Food in Turkey is similar to Mediterranean food but with more spice and flavor. Street food in Turkey is quite delicious with pinerli, a type of turkish pizza, starting at $2.50. Hot air balloon rides in Cappadocia range from $100-$175 per person.''Iran''Opening up to the world, Iran is quickly captivating travelers’ hearts with its stunning architecture, tasty food, and famously hospitable people.

If you fly into Morocco you will likely land at Casablanca airport and from there it is fairly simple to take a train, bus, or taxi to many of the most popular cities such as Marrakesh and Fez. By taxi from Casablanca to Fez is about 3 hours and $147 USD. Once inside the city there are city buses for 50 cents.''Dorms in Morocco begin at $6 USD, rooms on''Airbnb''begin at $15 USD, or if you have some extra cash, check out''booking.com''to stay in Riad, which is a traditional Moroccan house built around a courtyard typically, starting\xa0at $40. A typical Moroccan meal will range $3-5 and a higher-end meal is $12. A bottle of beer is $ 3 USD\xa0and water is $0.60\xa0USD. Museums are typically $2-$6 and camel trekking is $50. A daily suggested budget runs between $30-$60 a day. *Money saving tip: Negotiate your hostel or hotel in person. Be wary of touts trying to steer you the wrong way or scam you.''Sub-Saharan Africa:\xa0Mid-Range to Expensive''At''Golden Gate National Park''in South Africa''This part of the world has the potential to be mid-range if you camp, cook your own food and/or stay at backpacker accommodation. It also has the potential to be incredibly expensive and high into the luxury end, with very little in the middle.''Transportation can be difficult and you might be scratching your head wondering how locals afford $30 taxis to go short distances, until you see how overpacked and dangerous the cars and vans are. Hiring a private car, or even buying one, can sometimes be more economical in South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia, but as soon as the roads turn to dirt and mud as you head farther north, you’ll want a 4×4 and they can be very expensive to rent. National Park fees and safaris can get expensive too, ranging from as cheap as $80 per day for a safari to thousands.''Best websites for savings:''Accommodation: Check free Coast to Coast books in hostels in South Africa, and''AirBnB (click for $25 off!)'', otherwise, check individual camping and hostel websites and call ahead''Transport:''Intercape'',''Greyhound''South Africa''It used to cost a lot more to travel in South Africa, but lately with the value of the Rand falling, it’s becoming a cheaper and cheaper destination, particularly for a part of the world that can be on the expensive side. The big cities cost the most, and the rural areas tend to be the cheapest. The backpackers accommodation has everything from camping to higher-end rooms and are great places to stay with communal spaces and friendly vibes.''My personal spend was''$56 per day in South Africa'',\xa0which included renting a car, staying in a mixture of dorms and with friends, and eating out often instead of cooking (because I was feeling lazy and BBQ, or braai, in South Africa is delicious).''Mozambique''Vilanculos,\xa0Mozambique''Mozambique''runs pretty similar to South Africa in terms of pricing. A plate of delicious, fresh seafood will cost you $6-$12 at most beachside shacks, while buying directly from a fisherman can be pennies on the dollar. Transport is slightly expensive, annoying to use, and something you should definitely haggle on, which will be your biggest price consideration.''Activities like SCUBA diving and boating around the islands can get very expensive, while accommodation is well-priced at $15-$20 per person for a private beach bungalow with a mosquito net and fan.''Kenya''Kenya had focused much of its attention on luxury tours and safaris in the past, but more recently has begun to focus attention on budget travelers as well. Backpackers accommodations offer dorms from $6-$12 depending on location, mid-range hotels cost $15-$30, and high-end hotels can go into the thousands. Eating in Kenya can be very cheap if you eat local. A typical Kenyan meal is just 0.87. If you prefer to eat Western meals, you ‘ll likely pay $4-$8. Some attractions in Kenya are costly, such as Nairobi National Park for $40 per day and Maasai Mara Game Reserve for$60 per day, but for the most part Kenya is a more budget friendly destination than its neighbors. Purchase an East Africa visa for $100 which gives you access to Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda.''Tanzania''Tanzania can get very costly very quickly due to the pricing of major activities. Safaris to the Serengeti (''click here for a discount'') and Ngorongoro Crater each run several hundred to several thousand dollars, and climbing Kilimanjaro\xa0is in the thousands as well. The\xa0visa for Tanzania\xa0is also expensive, at\xa0$100 for US citizens.''It gets cheaper''when it comes to local buses, which are just a few dollars for long distances, and food can run just a few dollars per day from street vendors and cafes, and accommodation in guest houses\xa0starts at $16 per night.''Mauritius:''Hanging out in the Indian Ocean covered in lagoons, rainforests and waterfalls the island of Mauritius is the definition of paradise. But how much does it cost to go to this particular paradise? This luxurious island offers hotels on the budget end for $48-$85 and upwards for the fancy hotels and resorts.''Public buses are cheap'', and an opportunity to meet locals, so try one out for only $0.34-$0.86. Regular restaurants meals are $9 while a 4 course meal at a midrange restaurant for 2 people costs $35.''Central Asia and the Caucus Region: Cheap''Yerevan, Armenia''The Caucasus region is not commonly traveled and still very affordable, though Azerbaijan is generally more expensive than Armenia and Georgia. Americans don’t need visas to enter the region through Georgia or Armenia, though Azerbaijan requires payment for a visa on arrival ($20). Hotels or hostels cost around $20-40 per night for private rooms, while homestays are cheaper options. Food can be as cheap as $5. Rides in shared vans are common for public transportation in addition to buses or private taxis.''Georgia''Clean, inviting,''affordable'', and understated, Georgia is a hidden gem. Accommodation in Georgia starts at around $10 USD. In Tsibilis, public transportation is easy to use and cheap costing 0,50 Lari which is nearly 19 cents. Food in Georgia is also quite cheap with meals costing as little as $2.50. Such a meal includes a type of dumpling called Khinkali which are sold for 0.30 each. Activities such as museums range from $0.60 to $2.00 and are cheaper for students.''Tajikstan''Despite recent improvements in Tajikstan’s tourist infrastructure this remains a little-traveled to destination partly due to the the police corruption of the past and partly due to the fact that it’s not as cheap as some nearby alternatives. This is due to high costs of transportation. A suggested daily budget for two people is $89. Hotels in Tajikstan average about $30 USD per\xa0night.''For an incredible experience'', you can do a homestay or stay in a yurt for about $15. Local dishes will cost $3-$5 while western meals will cost $5-$10.''*The following 5 entries are contributed thanks to LostWithPurpose:''Afghanistan''Battered by decades of war, Afghanistan is not the type of place many people plan on visiting. It is, however, on many people’s bucket lists and a handful of intrepid travelers make it there every year. War has ravaged the county’s economy, and most goods need to be imported. Coupled with the need to fly everywhere for more than $100 round-trip, and sleep in hotels with security for $30+ per night, Afghanistan is a''relatively expensive place to travel'', though it can be done for about $50-75 per day.''Kazakhstan''Kazakhstan was long known as the most expensive Central Asian country to travel in. Luckily, with the recent devaluation of its currency,''those times have passed''. Due to its massive size and poor connections, getting around in Kazakhstan can be expensive, but hitchhiking is common. Besides sizable transport costs, other costs such as food, sights, and accommodation are all reasonably cheap, making travel in Kazakhstan possible for $25 per day or less.''Kyrgyzstan''Kyrgyzstan is the country of choice for most travelers interested in trying out Central Asia, and thus most well-suited to''travelers of all budgets''. There are hostels to be found for less than $10 per night in all of Kyrgyzstan’s major destinations, and homely community-based tourism home stays in other locations for about the same price. Cheap (if grubby) minibuses are available to every destination under the sun, and budget-friendly canteens are a dime a dozen… though Kyrgyzstan being Central Asian, don’t expect anything too tantalizing.''Uzbekistan''Uzbekistan is the stuff Silk Road dreams are made of. Towering mosques and mausoleums rise every which way you look, and its old cities are a maze of sand-colored buildings and narrow alleyways. Older package tourists from Europe currently comprise the majority of visitors to Uzbekistan, so some tourist activities can be a bit costly in nature. However, with dorms in hostels and guesthouses available for about $10 per night, and markets galore with fresh breads and cheeses for less than $1, it’s definitely possible to travel Uzbekistan''on a backpacker budget''.''Armenia''Tiny Armenia is often overlooked by travelers, but that will change soon! It’s a marvelous country filled with epic monasteries and churches, stunning mountains and rolling hills, and a million places to sit and sip wine for an afternoon. Armenia was the first country to officially adopt Christianity as the state religion, and believes it should be accessible to all, meaning all religious sites are free to enter! It’s also one of the oldest winemaking countries, so cheap and delicious sweet wine is widely available for rock bottom prices. Accommodation can be on the higher side, at around $20 a night, but''everything else is so cheap'', you won’t even notice.''East Asia:\xa0Mid-Range''Overall, East Asia will feel pretty expensive if you spend it mostly in Japan and South Korea. China, on the other hand, doesn’t have to be as expensive, especially if you stay in dorms and eat cheap. Spots like Hong Kong will make you break open your wallet again, and Taiwan lands somewhere in the middle, with prices easily reaching that of the US for some things, like high-end food and clothing, and super cheap for others, like accommodation and street food.''Best websites for savings:''Accommodation:''hostelworld'',''hostelbookers'',''Agoda''Transport:''Air Asia'',''12GoAsia''Japan''Believe it or not, Japan''might not be as costly''as you’ve heard. Hostels start at about $20 a night, which is no worse than Paris or London. Private ryokans can cost as little as $40 a night. If you’re craving sushi you can find sushi trains selling 6 pieces of sushi for $2 and ramen for $6. Transportation around Japan can get costly, particularly if you take a bullet train, which can cost nearly $100 for one hour. However the''rail pass''could make a lot of sense if you’re hitting lots of spots (thanks commenter Rachel for the info!), or to save money consider a bus which costs about 60 yen, or 50 cents.''China''China’s big cities have all kinds of fancy restaurants and hotels that can eat right into your budget in a big way, but it’s also possible to stay in hostels, which might just be the best-value hostels in the world at $5-$10 per night, and eat street food for just a few dollars per plate.''Transportation can run a bit more expensive at $20+ for 8-hour buses and upwards from there. China is a huge country and therefore, moving around quickly and on higher classes of train can add up quickly. My personal spend was about $50 per day, and I was''hitchhiking''to avoid train costs.''South Korea''South Korean boasts one of the most educated populations where 78% of them are on smart phones. The cost of traveling in South Korea is about $50 dollars a day but you could do it on a''shoestring for closer to $30''. Soups like kimchi jjigae can be found for $4-$6 and are full of delicious vegetables like cabbage and sprouts. The cheapest option for accommodation is jjimjilbang. This is a public bathhouse and costs $6-$10, though you will be sleeping on a mat in a room with other people.''Mongolia''Nestled between Russia and China, Mongolia is a country with more horses than people. Mongolia offers unique cultural and outdoor adventures that aren’t packed with tourists. A single entry visa to Mongolia costs $53 and has an''average daily cost of $50 per day''. Transportation in and out of Mongolia can be a bit expensive, with trains from Beijing to Ulaanbaatar costing over $190 one way. A cheaper third option includes an overnight bus, a local jeep ride, then a local train ride for around $80. Flights are typically quite expensive but still an option\xa0if you are tight on time and have extra cash. Hostels in the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar are around $6-$15 a night and many only take USD, so carry both forms of currency. Expect food to cost $4-$7 per\xa0day and just\xa00.78 per beer!''Southeast Asia: Cheap''The''White Temple Chiang Rai, Thailand''Southeast Asia is among the cheapest regions in the world to travel through. It’s also''one of the easiest'', often referred to as the ‘banana pancake trail’ thanks to how well it accommodates backpackers of all ages. On a shoestring, it’s even possible to travel through Southeast Asia for the golden $30 per day. I personally''spent $6k on 6 months''in the region, if you subtract my expensive SCUBA diving habit.''Best websites for savings:''Accommodation:''hostelworld'',''hostelbookers'',''Agoda''Transport:''Air Asia''Thailand''A favorite amongst backpackers and luxury vacationers alike, Thailand is the cheapest in the north and gets more expensive in the islands to the south.

My personal spend for one month there was''$36 per day on average''.''Indonesia''Kawah Ijen in Indonesia''Indonesia is another place that can be dirt cheap, or pretty good affordable luxury value if you want to spend more and have more comfort. There are a lot more tourist transport options and expensive restaurants in Indonesia that can really add up, but don’t forget there’s always a way that locals get around (like a local ferry instead of a tourist boat) and eat, too. Find those options and you can easily''keep to $30 per day''.''Cambodia''Cambodia is one of the cheapest countries in Southeast Asia, a region that’s already dirt cheap.''You can find dorms''for as little as $2 per night! Beer is, thankfully, also pretty cheap and delicious at as little as 75 cents during happy hour. If you’ve got a little more money to throw around, you’ll be pretty impressed by how far $25 will go towards a room in a decent hotel.''I spent $30 per day in Cambodia''.''Laos''Like Cambodia, Laos is also super cheap and can be done for $30 per day. I found that transport was a bit more expensive there, but other things like accommodation, food, and many activities were cheap (like a $1.50 entry fee to view a stunning waterfall) or free. Here’s my''budget guide for Laos''.''Philippines''The''Philippines is another pretty cheap''destination, as long as you don’t move around too often. Islands are farther apart and require a lot more planes and ferries.''South Asia: Cheap''At the Thurong La Pass on Nepal’s''Annapurna circuit''In general, South Asia is one of the cheapest regions in the world that you can travel in, with a few exceptions.

Bhutan maintains that it charges tourists this''$250 daily charge''in order to ensure that Bhutan retains the type of tourist they want. Although $250 per day might be restrictive for some, Bhutan remains one of the most authentic countries you will ever visit.''Maldives''While the Maldives is certainly famous for catering to the rich and famous, believe it or not, hostels and cheaper,''local guest houses''and''mid-range resorts''mean it’s more within reach than it has been in the past, at as cheap as $100/day with activities like diving, food, and lodging included. Cheaper flights with Air Asia and Sri Lankan Airlines also make it easier to get to than it’s ever been.''India''Prior to going to India you will have to apply for a visa. India has a fairly straightforward online application, and if you want to go for 30 days it costs $60 for US passport holders and $48 for EU passport holders. India is perhaps the cheapest country to travel to, but if and only if you’re willing to haggle and hunt for deals. Keep in mind that cheap rooms that run in the $3 range will be very basic and it’s normal to shower with buckets of heated water.\xa0You will be hard pressed to find cheap gems in the North but the South with its gorgeous beaches may prove more fruitful when it comes to budget accommodation. Expect to pay 200-600 rupees depending on your haggling skills.''India has loads of growing hotel sites, such as''OYO''and''Cleartrip'', that will display\xa0“affordable” rooms for around 400INR-600INR (5-7 USD). The best trick is to look up these hotels then go there and try to negotiate a price directly with them.''Travel by train in India is absolutely dirt cheap, but book your tickets yourself! Do not trust a local “travel agency” to do it or you might get a train to find you don’t have a ticket. In order to book online you will have to get an account with Indiarail –''here’s a guide to help with that''. \xa0When you book trains you will be asked which class you want, and while the AC 2 tier might be a little pricier, for the overnight journeys it is well worth it. Flights within India are also very cheap with flights from Mumbai to Goa going for as little as $30.\xa0Buses and metros are fairly good and reliable, especially in New Delhi and Mumbai. They also have Uber and Ola which will take you 10 miles for about $300 INR/ $4.41 USD. Local buses are between $25-$100 INR or $0.37-$1.10 USD depending on the distance you travel.''A sit down dinner for two people can be 600 rupees or $8.81 USD (if you feel like splurging). Street food is delicious and absolutely worth trying\xa0as well. Samosas are about $20-$40INR.\xa0Bottled water is a must and runs $20-$40 INR or $0.30 USD, or bring water purifying tablets. Sights for tourist will often be $500 -$1000 INR. In general, a daily budget of $30 USD a day for 1 should be plenty, though on a shoestring it can be even cheaper.''Sri Lanka''Sri Lanka is a cheap country in some ways and in others, can be quite expensive. Tourism is one of the biggest and fastest growing industries at the moment, and everything from guesthouse rooms to fancy hotels are springing up. Generally, transport is''very cheap with train tickets''running at just a few dollars, while guesthouses can be more like $20 for a room, which is sometimes hard to swing for a solo traveler. Food runs at about $3-$5 USD for local food. Where Sri Lanka gets expensive is its activities and heritage sites, such as in the''Cultural Triangle'', which tend to cost around $40 or more per site. My''personal spend in Sri Lanka was $50/day.''Nepal''Much like India, Nepal is a very cheap country to travel through, with most food, accommodation, and transport running at just a few dollars if you eat, sleep, and travel using local options. If you end up trekking, as long as you do so independently and avoid Mt. Everest itself, which costs tens of thousands of dollars, you can travel for as cheap as $8 per day on food and accommodation at the lower elevations, and closer to $15 USD at higher elevations on popular routes like the''Annapurna Circuit''.''Pakistan''Not many foreign tourists make it to Pakistan thanks to its bad reputation. Travelers who do make it there, though, are welcomed by exceptionally hospitable people, and sights devoid of tourists. Due to its lack of mass scale tourism (and location in the subcontinent),''prices are low''. Most religious sights are free to enter, cheap street food is plentiful, and hotel rooms can be found for $5-$8 USD per night. The fact that Pakistanis will fall over each other in a rush to host you and invite you to dinner makes it even more affordable!

You won’t have a good time…''This is what we were told only two weeks before we planned to travel to Zimbabwe,\xa0and\xa0not just by one person, but by multiple people. It put a\xa0seed of doubt in our heads, and when we looked at government safety warnings for Zimbabwe online, things didn’t sound\xa0much better.''Zimbabwe in recent years has become increasingly unstable politically.\xa0We had been warned of fuel shortages that would leave us stranded in towns and of\xa0being fleeced by police for every dollar we had.''We’ve come to find that what you hear from others and what you experience are two entirely different things. We were five months into our overland trip across Africa and feeling fearless, so despite the advice, we continued on with our travel plans to Zimbabwe.''Forming our own\xa0opinion''The day we crossed the famous bridge over Victoria Falls to Zimbabwe we were greeted by friendly border agents. The process was easy by''African standards'', and the border police waved us on our way with a smile.\xa0It didn’t take long for us to begin enjoying Zimbabwe.''After all, taking in Victoria Falls from the Zimbabwean side is the only way to see that falls properly in our books, and having high tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel made us feel as we’d been set right in the middle of a movie set with Queen Elizabeth as the main star.''After our first week in Zimbabwe, we were starting to give a second thought to the warning we had been given regarding the country:''Corrupt Police Officers'': We were repeatedly warned that the police were well known for''conducting shakedowns on tourists''. We’d even heard reports of them arresting motorists on accounts of not having enough cash to pay their on-the-spot fines.''Bad Roads'':\xa0This should pretty much be expected anywhere in Africa, but asides from the main roads, Zim is supposed to have the worst.''Cash Shortages'': With serious''economic uncertainties''in the country it has been increasingly difficult for the government to get their hands on USD. Which, is the only stable currency used in Zimbabwe after the total collapse of the Zimbabwean dollar.''Fuel Shortages'': Fuel all around the world is purchased with USD. So, when a country has shortages of USD it makes it very difficult for them to purchase oil. The result is''empty petrol stations''while the fuel sits on the borders waiting to be bought.''Political Instability'': Have you ever heard of''Robert Mugabe''? He’s Zimbabwe’s first and only president for almost four decades now. He leads a regime of corruption and driven a formerly prosperous country into the ground. Many people aren’t too happy with him.''Crime'': With poverty often comes crime. We had been told that opportunity''theft was a very common occurrence''in Zimbabwe and that locals can hassle tourists looking to swipe their valuables. It’s the same story you pretty much always hear in developing nations, except this one is worse due to Zim’s economic ruin.''Our\xa0Experience in Zimbabwe''We decided that despite all that, we’d brave leaving the tourist haven of Victoria Falls and form our own opinions. Our plan was to drive around Lake Kariba, the largest man-made lake in the world. Spending 18 hours on the roads and driving some 800kms we were certain that if Zimbabwe had any safety concerns, we would \xa0most likely come across them.\xa0It would be an uncertain adventure by all accounts.''The lake is the Northern most border of Zimbabwe and divides the nation from Zambia. The man made part comes from the mighty Zambezi having been dammed for one of the largest hydroelectric plants in the world supplying power to both nations.''The region is the''iconic Africa''that you picture in your head – villages, bad roads, baobabs, rivers, mountains, prehistoric fossils, and amazing wildlife.''This is a place that is good for the soul.''It took us\xa0800 kms, multiple days, and 21\xa0hours of driving to make it around the lake.''The roads were about 90% mud with only\xa0one stretch of single-lane, paved road. The paved road was so full of potholes after villagers\xa0had removed the concrete for to make bricks for their homes, we were actually wishing to be back in the mud.''Our first day we took the backroads to Binga. A place that was once a popular destination for those looking to rent houseboats and go fishing on the lake, but now feels like a scene from an old dilapidated eighties movie. We were expecting something more, but instead, it took us two hours to track down gas, food, and accommodation. Luckily we managed to find a beautiful campsite at the Masumu Lodge.''The next day we took off towards the Musango Safari\xa0Camp. Things started to look up as the drive exceeded all expectations. We drove on single track roads through remote villages. Villagers would stop dead in their tracks and stare as we drove by, as seeing tourists in this area was rarer than a blue moon.''The road conditions continued to deteriorate, but as they grew worse the beauty of the region grew too. We climbed and descended mountains and valleys that were lush and filled with indigenous bird and wildlife. We watched elephants crossing the road, flycatchers feeding their young, hippos basking in the rivers, fish eagles flying overhead, and herds of impala grazing alongside the road.''By the time we had made it to our safari camp on the lake, our truck was 60 liters shy of making it back out to our end goal. The nearest village nearby didn’t even have a shop, let alone a gas station. So, using the bush network we were able to procure our 60 liters of fuel for $120 from a nearby local crocodile farmer. To put this in standard terms we paid $7.65 a gallon.''Ouch! We never claimed that Africa was cheap.''Despite the fuel setback, we were in the Africa we dreamed of and completely on our own.''The next day was a muddy hill climb up a mountain as the night before gave us massive rains. Whole sections of the road were missing and deep pits of mud put our 4×4 to a test. Thankfully, we made it up over the mountain and continued our stunning drive.''It was a day filled with mud and water.''By the time we had finished the journey our truck was a different color and we were exhausted. We pulled into Kariba, a small town in Zimbabwe where the lake ends and the Zambezi River continues. We set up camp at Warthogs Bushcamp along the Lake for $6 a night and immediately went to the bar. Sitting down to a meal of''sadza'', relish and beef with two Zambezi Lagers we felt that Zimbabwe had treated us right – it would be hard to leave.''Our Report on Zimbabwe''Police Corruption'': Not one single police shakedown. We had two encounters with the police. Both instances they were polite, checked our license/registration and waved us on.''Road Network:''The “back” roads are indeed bad in Zimbabwe, but most travelers will not be driving on them. The paved roads we did drive on were in decent condition.''Cash Shortages:''Cash shortages are a factor when traveling Zimbabwe. However, they should not deter you. Many tourist destinations (like Vic Falls) took credit card, including the national parks service. We were also able to bring in cash from outside the country. So, with proper planning, it shouldn’t be any issue.''Fuel Shortages:''We found and were told that fuel in recent months is readily available throughout the country. It is only in more remote locations where they are still having fuel shortages.''Political Instability:''Mugabe is not going to be getting any “best president” awards from his citizens. However, we found that Zimbabweans are simply waiting for Mugabe’s time to come to an end and hoping for a peaceful transition to a new system. The optimism that many citizens displayed was surprising. To keep up with the''current political situation check here''.''Crime:''Petty theft is a problem everywhere in the world, but one that we never experienced while in Zimbabwe. We left with everything we came with and had a great time.''Why You Should go to Zimbabwe''The Wildlife''Do you remember Cecil the lion''? Zimbabweans were proud to call him theirs until he met his ultimate demise. Don’t worry though – the game in Zimbabwe does not stop with one male lion! They have numerous game parks throughout the country, some considered the best in all of Southern Africa. With parks such Hwange, Mana Pools, Matusadona, and Matobo Hills you’re sure to find plenty of wildlife.''The History''It’s particularly difficult to pick a timeframe to refer to when it comes to Zimbabwe. Should it be prehistoric? There have been numerous paleontology sights found in Zimbabwe. We were lucky enough to visit one found by''Steve Edwards''. Or what about the former Kingdom of Zimbabwe home to the largest ruins in Africa. Or what about what was the colonial heart of Africa? Visitors can have high tea at the famous Victoria Falls Hotel while watching bungee jumpers on the Victoria Falls Bridge. A hotel that since it’s inception has seen dignitaries from all around the world including kings, princes, presidents, and prime ministers. Even a young Queen Elizabeth’s photo hangs\xa0on the walls\xa0of the institution.''The People''It’s extraordinarily difficult to put western standards on Africans. With a high unemployment rate, Zimbabwe is struggling. Despite the poor economic situation the Zimbabweans we spent time with were surprisingly upbeat and friendly. We talked to a number of locals\xa0about the struggles of their country and they all still seem to have a glimmer\xa0of hope in them.''The Adventure''While Zimbabwe does come with its travel woes, it also comes with stories. We certainly didn’t want to nearly run out of gas and pay $120 for 2/3 a tank, but it does make for an interesting story that we will never forget.

On our trip, we were fortunate enough to be offered a job teaching English and it’s been one of our most amazing experiences to date. One of the best things about integrating as a local is that your travel experience can be enriched through local knowledge and sites off the beaten path. Acting on this knowledge and utilizing this closely guarded travel tip has led us to some pretty unimaginable locations we would only dare to dream of previously before we ventured far and wide into the World. Coinciding with taking some time off from our teaching roles in May, the location this time would take us all the way to the Sichuan Province in the North East, tiptoeing across the Tibetan border.''Flying into Jiuzhaigou airport, the third highest airport in China, we were immediately greeted by the mountains that smothered the landscape of the Sichuan Province. The deep valleys and birds eye mountain views only preparing us for what was to come in this rural and rugged land.''Neighboring Tibet, Jiuzhaigou is instantly recognizable by its vast array of multicolored prayer flags that have been strewn across the hillsides, each colour representing a different element and each baring individual thought and devotion.''Jiuzhaigou is also known throughout the World for its national park, a popular tourist spot amongst Chinese travellers due to its\xa0beauty, crystal clear lakes and its barrage of forest. It is in fact its neighbor, Huanglong National Park that is the hidden gem of the province and largely overshadowed by its big brother.''A mere 40 minutes drive away from the touristic town of Jiuzhaigou, many of whom stay in the town where the National Park is only a few minutes walk away Huanglong is often disappointingly dismissed by travellers. We were surprised how many locals attempted to discourage us from making the journey to Huanglong in order to keep the tourism within the local town; however, the park is definitely not to be missed.''Although its not as easily accessible as the Jiuzhaigou National Park, getting to Huanglong is relatively straightforward and inexpensive. There are regular buses that make the trip from Jiuzhaigou town everyday departing around 9am and returning for 4pm. These buses are very cheap, however, the mountainous terrain doubles the journey time, meaning that you only have a few hours to explore. We opted to take a private taxi that was arranged for us by our guest house. It cost us around 400RMB to hire the driver for the day, but it was worth every penny. He collected us at 8am sharp and we didn’t set back to Jiuzhaigou until 5pm.''As we wound our way through the mountains, our driver stopped frequently to allow us to marvel at the surroundings and of course, pose for some obligatory pictures!! We were amazed at the prayer flags that had been set by the locals, the different colors brightening the landscape and acting as a reminder that we were venturing along the Tibetan border.''We arrived at the park after 9am and paid just 210RMB for the pleasure of entering the grounds. Unlike the Jiuzhaigou National Park that sees thousands of visitors each day, ourselves and another family were the only visitors. Wooden decking maps out the walkways to the different sections of the natural pools. Although getting around is not strenuous and those looking for a breather will undoubtedly be spoilt for opportunities to catch a breath while admiring each cascading pool, there is also a cable car that transports visitors for 80RMB.''We headed through the gates where we were greeted by the 5km stretch of ice cold limestone pools that stretched as far as the eye could see. We had never seen anything like it. At 3500m above sea level, each pool had been uniquely formed from the rainwater flow from the mountains above, which acted as the perfect backdrop, and complimented the landscape to a tee.''One of the most surreal places we have visited, it’s with no doubt that this well kept secret is worthy of a “Wonder Of The World” title.''Laying our eyes on landscapes such as that of Huanglong National Park confirms to us why we love to travel. The unimaginable natural beauty, the serenity of the atmosphere and the bluer than blue icy pools have helped us to create memories that will last a lifetime.''One thing that we have learnt from our travels around China is to expect the unexpected. The world is a beautiful place and sometimes the most beautiful places are those that are kept the most secret of all. From karst landscapes, dazzling skylines and unusual landforms, China has some amazing places that we never knew existed.''About the Authors:''Charlie and Charlotte are the wanderlusting couple behind''TheWanderLovers.com''.

When you’re a solo traveler, you need to talk to strangers. I was a shy kid, I didn’t even have a courage to start a conversation with my auntie when I was very young. Solo travel forced me to talk to survive and proved me that there is no harm talking to a strangers. As I am an Indonesian, I was shown how woman should be when they are 25 years old – married and having kids, I was told that the world out there is too dangerous for a woman to travel alone, that you could get raped, robbed and other bad things would happen to you.

Anyone can have them with the right approach. It’s not about being the life of the party, the person who knows everybody at the hostel because he’s been there for months, or being the most gregarious person in the room. It’s not person in the room who who did the most research before starting his/her trip who will get to have those magical, authentic experiences.''Pin me!''The secret sauce is being authentic yourself in your approach and your interest level. That endears you to people, and opens up a lot of doors.''How can you do that? These seven easy steps are my recipe for authentic travel experiences, and they can work for anyone:''1. Take genuine interest in other people''It’s easy to make friends when they know you’re for real (taken in''Tofo, Mozambique'')''Whether it’s a fellow traveler, the guide for your day tour''climbing on glaciers'', or the person sitting at reception at your guesthouse, taking a genuine interest in people opens so many doors, not just to friendship but for adventures too.''Even if you’re the shy type, you’ll find that if you stay in social places, conversations will happen, even if you’re not the one to initiate them. Just sit in the common room of a social hostel and you’ll see what I mean.''There are so many times when chatting with someone, giving them not just my full attention but also my genuine interest, led to them sharing a travel secret with me, going the extra mile to make my stay better, or even offering up an amazing opportunity to''join them at a local event''.''2. Take genuine interest in their culture''Getting immersed in the''San Pedro de Atacama desert''in Chile''Most people really love sharing their culture and the things that they’re proud of about where they’re from. If they can tell you are genuinely interested in learning more about the way that they prepare and eat food, celebrate holidays and milestones, and even how they drink tea, you’ll be welcomed in and will get those unique cultural experiences that money can’t buy.''Once in''El Chalten in Argentinian Patagonia'', I asked a local girl who was also cooking in the hostel kitchen if she would show me how to properly drink''mate'', a tea that is popular with locals and also a communal activity. She spent the next hour excitedly explaining the details to me while we drank the mate and chatted with her family, cooking together, sharing a bottle of\xa0Malbec wine, and having a lovely evening.''When people can tell that you genuinely care about them and their customs, they tend to be amazing hosts.''3. Remember things that people tell you, especially their names''In Spitzkoppe''Namibia''Do you plan on being in one place for a while, or even just a few days? Make it a point to learn the names of the people who work at the guesthouse or hotel you’re staying at, who you see the most often in the common areas, or who helped you plan something.''Names are one of the hardest things to remember when you travel because you meet so many people, but if you can say it in your mind a few times or even write it down if you need to, it’s much easier to make, and keep, friends on the road.''As Dale Carnegie said in his incredibly insightful book,''How to Win Friends and Influence People''(affiliate link), “Using a person’s name is crucial, especially when meeting those we don’t see very often. Respect and acceptance stem from simple acts such as remembering a person’s name and using it whenever appropriate.''Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.”''4.\xa0Eat\xa0where locals eat''Soup in Vietnam''If you want an immersive experience and particularly if you’re on a budget, you’ll love that eating well can be both cheap and authentic – just eat the street food!

If it doesn’t get them sick, you’ll be fine too.''Eating local is\xa0what led me to a''coconut brawl in Nepal'', something that I didn’t see any other foreigners at and haven’t really heard of anyone attending since, just outside of Kathmandu. When a local saw a friend and I eating traditional Nepalese food at a tiny stall instead of at the\xa0fancy tourist cafes nearby, he felt compelled to tell us about the festival, which was one of the coolest things I did in Nepal.''5. Be kind with people even when they’re not kind with you''Making friends with locals''Not everyone is going to be receptive to your friendly approach. Sometimes, people are having a bad day or they just seem disinterested at first. In these cases, it’s even more important to be friendly.''When I approach people, I think about the way my mom’s dog, Ollie, does it. Everyone has the potential to be his friend, it doesn’t matter how they look. You’d have to just not like dogs in order to not like Ollie, he’s so friendly, excited, and genuine with his approach.''When I approach people in that way, with friendliness and a smile, it makes it a lot harder for them to dislike me. Even if I don’t get a warm response, I don’t take it personally, and I don’t lose my friendliness.''I’m not always successful at being a ball of joy, radiating happiness, but when I am, things go my way more often than not.''6. Read up on customs and learn how to say hello and thank you\xa0right away''Cover the shoulders and knees at temples – check''In Thailand, it’s rude to face\xa0your feet at someone, a temple, or the front of a boat. In India, pointing, especially with your left hand, is considered particularly rude. It’s helpful to know this cultural etiquette and to practice it when you’re on the road, as well as learning how to say the basics like ‘hello’ and ‘thank you.’''It goes back to point number 2 – if people feel you’ve not only taken an interest, but genuinely respect their culture, they’ll be a lot warmer towards you. For etiquette around the world, check out''this listing on eDiplomat''.''7. Remember you’re not so different than the people in the country you’re visiting''Trying on the local dress''How often have you heard fellow travelers talk about the people in the country they’re visiting like another species?''“Can you believe that’s what they eat?”''“Have you seen the way they do XYZ? It’s absurd!”''It seems obvious when written out in plain black and white that this would naturally be a negative behavior when traveling, but it happens all the time in hostels, and I’ve even caught myself doing it, to be honest.''We’re all human beings, though, and we have so much more in common than we often realize. We all love, laugh, cry, sleep, hope, dream, and yearn for meaningful connections. When we acknowledge that about each other, it’s a lot easier to find some common ground.''Basically, authentic travel experiences come down not just to being an egalitarian traveler, but an overall kind and genuine person.

I’ve searched high and low, and these are some of my favorite destinations for solo female travel – they might surprise you!''Maui, Hawaii''Because it’s for more than just honeymooners.''It’s crazy to think that Hawaii would be a good place to travel to solo, but I was delighted to find that there were tons of things for me to do even though I wasn’t on my honeymoon. I made friends easily while\xa0snorkeling, found a lot of active adventures, like hiking to waterfalls on the''Road to Hana'', and''found a surf school''especially for women as well!''Coffee Bay, South Africa''Because Africa isn’t ‘scary’ after all.''Africa gets a bad rap as being a scary place to travel through, and while it’s important to take precautions (''here’s a list of them''), that doesn’t mean solo female travelers should write it off. I love how laid-back Coffee Bay (and that whole coastline) is and how many cool other backpackers are always passing through. It’s easy to meet other people and go on long walks along the bluffs on the ocean and take in the gorgeous nature.

I know that sounds impossible, but head up to Pai and you’ll see exactly what I mean. It’s eclectic, full of yogis and social people, and the waterfalls around there are magical.''I love Pai''for the laid back and free-spirited people it attracts.''Chengdu, China''Because the expat scene is diverse and so much fun.''Usually you have to actually be an expat to be part of the expat scene but in Chengdu, China, it’s such a nice mix of travelers, locals, and English teachers from Italy, France, Ireland, Mexico, and a bunch of other places all over the world. There are''only a few\xa0bars''like Jellyfish and Jah Bar that the social crowd frequents so it’s easy to see familiar faces if you stay for a little while.''Arugam Bay, Sri Lanka''Because places that attract surfers are social by nature.''This little surfing town on''Sri Lanka’s East Coast'', which doesn’t get nearly as much tourism as the booming south, is so tranquil\xa0and chill, it’s hard to leave. Places that have a sport as their main draw always attract more solo travelers, and this little surfing town in paradise is one of them. Extra points if you''take the train there'', one of the best parts about traveling through\xa0Sri Lanka.''Bukit Lawang, Indonesia''It’s about more than orangutans.''…but''you’ll see Orangutans''there too, which is cool, because this is one of\xa0the only places where they live in the wild.''Bukit Lawang is\xa0a tiny little trekking\xa0town with a river running through it, deep in the jungles of Sumatra. I couldn’t believe it, but after my second day there, locals and expats were calling out my name to say ‘hello’ as I walked by. It’s such a social and friendly place, they already knew me by name.\xa0It felt like a family in a way.

For the same reasons that I loved the Annapurna Circuit, I love the social atmosphere amongst campers and hikers on this trek, particularly on the back, ‘O’, part of the trail where fewer hikers go and the crowds are more intimate. Refugio Dickson, in particular, was tons of fun thanks to the social rangers who played music and organized soccer games.''Otres Beach, Cambodia''Because it’s still chill''Serendipity Beach in Cambodia’s Sihanoukville used to be the most coveted\xa0place for backpackers on the Cambodian coast, but I much prefer''laid-back Otres Beach''.

Though I already had a place to stay, I met people in Bologna via Craig’s List just to hang out, and ended up with a mixed crowd of locals and students from all over the world. There’s a nice history there, and I got fewer cat calls and purse-snatching attempts there since University towns tend to be a bit safer, people send their kids there after all.''Coron, Philippines''Because\xa0dive towns attract people.''There are a lot of social places in the Philippines, but the best for above and under the water, is''Coron and Apo reef''nearby.

I remember laughing and dancing at the reggae bar there with Masai warriors dressed in regalia, local beach boys, and tourists from all over, loving how communal and inviting it was. Even if you go there solo, you can find your people. Just lock up your stuff in the safes, as there’s some petty crime.''El Chalten, Argentina''The most social place in Patagonia''Much of Patagonia, particularly along the''Carretera Austral'', is remote and quiet, but if you’re solo,''El Chalten''is the best mix of nature and social opportunities. The hostels are warm and friendly places, many of the hikes and campsites are well-loved, and it’s easy to meet others on the more trodden hikes. Far from the cat calls of Buenos Aires, I found El Chalten to be a breath of fresh air.''After traveling for over four years, mostly by myself, I’ve found some really special gems around this world that seemed have that special something that was missing from many others, and all of these places have that.''I was delighted to find, sometimes in the places that I least expected, that such friendly people and that amazing of a social atmosphere could exist, and that’s the beauty of traveling on your own.''Still need help with the planning, financing, figuring out how to travel for cheap or even free, and what to bring?''Get the Guidebook for Solo Female Travelers!''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Idaho, it’s a little crazy how quickly you charmed me.

Norquay\xa0also has tubing available for most ages.''Snow Shoeing at Lake Louise Ski Resort''It’s a fun way to get some adrenaline without exerting energy if you’re sore, need a break, or just aren’t that into skiing. I also loved the views from Mt. Norquay\xa0and Lake Louise!''Skate at Lake Louise''A frozen Lake Louise in Banff''Probably the most famous lake in Banff national Park, and the one that made me want to visit so badly, is Lake Louise. It ices over in the winter time and turns into a whole different kind of magic.''Though the intense blue that made it famous isn’t visible when it’s iced and snowed over, the benefits include a much smaller crowd, a chance to walk on the famous lake, and even to play hockey or ice skate on it. Later on in the winter, they have ice sculptures as well!''Johnston canyon''I just loved taking a walk through Johnston Canyon when it was covered in snow. The waterfalls were mostly frozen as well, which was somehow even more beautiful than when they are flowing.''The lower falls at Johnston Canyon in Banff National Park''There is a walkway that winds through the Canyon so you can go through without needing snowshoes. It does help to have ice spikes that you can wrap around your boots, but in lieu of that, just to make sure that you’ve got some good tread on your shoes.''Ice climbing''If you like rock climbing, or are just curious about what it would be like, then chances are pretty good you’ll love ice climbing too.''An\xa0axe in each hand and long and lethal spikes on your feet, you start out by learning how to properly walk on the ice and then you get ready to climb. It’s a dance of wedging in the ice axes and stomping the toe of your boot into the ice as you climb ever higher. The satisfaction from getting up there is pretty awesome, and guaranteed you will have sore calves and triceps for days afterwards!''I went climbing with''Yamnuska Adventures''and loved the professionalism of the guide and the quality gear we used.''Caving''A stalactite that looks like bacon (so of course I loved it)''Caving totally brought out my inner child as I crawled and slid down the rocks and mud, rappelling short distances and marveling at the formations in the cave.''It was good for my claustrophobia to confront my fear of small spaces, and to find that I actually really enjoyed the feeling of crawling through the tunnels, feeling around in the total darkness when we turned off our headlamps for fun, and warming up in the cave which was nice and insulated on an otherwise absolutely freezing day!''I went caving with''Canmore Cave Tours'', who offer this activity year-round.''Bonus: Check out neighboring Canmore''A frozen river in Canmore''Just outside of Banff National Park, a 20-30 minute drive away, is the town of Canmore. Just like Banff, it’s surrounded by the rockies and full of absolutely breathtaking photo ops in and outside of town. In contrast to Banff, it’s a bit less touristy but still retains all of the small town charm and friendliness of the area.''I loved how many sweeping Rockies views there were from right in town, and enjoyed driving around the breathtaking surroundings as well. Definitely stop by if you’re in the area (I recommend''Paintbox lodge''for the night)!''Those were a few of my favorite adventures while in Banff, which I’m glad to say not only met but exceeded my expectations. The dramatic Rockies, the crystal clear skies, the mounds and mounds of snow, and the limitless amount of activities has me wanting to go back and check out the other seasons too.''One thing’s for sure, though: If you want Banff minus the crowds, check it out in the beautiful winter.''Read Next: Just 25 Magical Photos of Alberta in the Winter''*This post was brought to you in collaboration with Travel Alberta. All thoughts and opinions expressed are my own, always.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Just 25 Gorgeous Photos of Alberta in the Winter''12 Pictures that Prove Idaho is the Most Beautiful Winter State''Canoeing in Manitoba’s Nopiming Provincial Park''When I think of Namibia I think of red hot dunes slowly shifting with the winds. I think of great natural wonders like Fish River Canyon and the Skeleton Coast. I think of sandboarding and adventures across the desert while gazing at the ocean. There is one thing that doesn’t always necessarily come to mind when I think about Namibia, though, and that’s the wildlife.''If you’re coming to Africa for the wildlife you may think about giving desert-like Namibia a skip. I never knew that any creature could survive in such harsh and inhospitable conditions, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. The wildlife in Namibia is nothing short of incredible. At times when we weren’t even looking, we saw cheetah, oryx, wild horses, seals, and\xa0flamingos. Who says you have to go on an all out expensive African safari to see some animals when it’s all waiting for you in Namibia?''Go to Namibia for the sand dunes, canyons, and oceans , but stay for the animal sightings. Here is a guide to finding the best and more diverse wildlife in Namibia:''The Wild Horses of\xa0the Namib''Shortly after seeing''Fish River Canyon'', the second largest canyon in the world, we made our way to the strange German town of Luderitz. Luderitz is small town located right between the desert and the ocean. From Luderitz you can explore the Luderitz Peninsula. It is chalk full of wildlife, where you can find oryx, brown hyena, jackals, flamingos, springbok, and more.''However, it is the marine that is the star of the show in Luderitz. Visitors can spot the rare\xa0Haviside’s Dolphin. Whales such as the minke, southern right, fin, and pygmy right can also be spotted in season not far out of Luderitz Bay. Our personal favorite in the area is the massive penguin colony on Halifax Island.''125\xa0kilometers outside of Luderitz is the tiny mountain town, Aus. \xa0Just outside of Aus is Garub which is nothing more than a wheel in the desert. It is there you can find the feral\xa0horses of the desert, as it is the only place\xa0to drink for kilometers.''You may be thinking that horses aren’t exactly wildlife, but seeing the\xa0horses that have been untamed by humans and surviving in the desert is truly special. We came up on them late in the afternoon\xa0and watched them from a distance. We must have peaked their curiosity because\xa0about 50 of them started trotting towards our direction. It was apparent these horses were hungry and suffering from the drought and saw us as a source of food. Although, they were wild the horses were still so tame, calm, and with a completely different demeanor than the average stable horse.''Good to know'': The wild horses haven’t been so wild these past few years. Namibia is going through a major drought so the Gondwana Klein Aus Vista lodge has been donating hay to keep the horses alive.''To see the wild horses I suggest staying nearby at''Gondwana’s Klein-Aus-Vista camp''or at an''Airbnb''in Luderitz.''The Gemsbok of the Desert''I came to realize that what is most astonishing about the Namib desert are the species that live and have adapted to the brutal forces of nature. We drove far into the NamibRand Nature Reserve with one of the local guys showing us around to see just that. He was telling us about his family, his life in Namibia, and his favorite foods before he started screaming “A cheetah! Look, there’s a cheetah!” We couldn’t believe our\xa0eyes – there in front of us was a real life cheetah in the middle of the Namib desert. He sprinted across the road in the blink of an eye, before we could even realize what had happened.''Our next seven days in the desert were filled with zebra, snakes, hyena, springbok, white mongooses, and thousands of gemsbok.''Gemsbok (or oryx) are beautiful gray antelope that look like they were painted perfectly with black and white strips. They have massive horns which they use to fight one another and are very skittish\xa0creatures. I saw my first oryx near''the Fish River Canyon''and thought it was the beautiful animal in Africa. Before I knew it I was in the desert seeing thousands! The national animal of Namibia should be\xa0the oryx!''As if cheetahs, zebra, and springbok aren’t enough we were even informed that there are desert giraffe and elephant in the Namib desert. We never saw them with our time there as they are quite rare, but they can be found in Damaraland to the North.''Good to know:''To truly get a glimpse of the desert landscapes and wildlife I recommend staying for at least two days and truly get to know southern Namibia and the desert.''Stay:''To see the wildlife in the desert I\xa0suggest staying on\xa0the incredible NamibRand Nature Reserve.''The Flamingos on the Coast''Swakopmund is the highlight of many travelers’ Namibian road trip. Like Ludertiz the city is set right in between the ocean and the desert making it the perfect adventure destination.''Sandboarding, four wheeling, paragliding, and skydiving''are very popular options here. Once you are exhausted from all the activities\xa0head south to Swakop’s sister city, Walvis Bay.''Walvis Bay is Namibia’s main port down and there isn’t a whole lot going on there. However, there are a few things going for it and one is the chance to see thousands of greater and lesser flamingos. These pink birds call Walvis Bay home all year round.''We ended up staying for four days in Walvis Bay and watched the sun rise and set with the flamingos. Their “honks” became a common sound to hear and watching them feed all day was more than entertaining. The flamingos are steps away from the shore so you get a chance to get up close and personal with them here. Walvis Bay is also famous for the massive great white pelican that can be found in the bay and along the massive salt flats just south of town.''Good to know:''Swakopmund is one of the biggest cities in Namibia. From coffee shops to hardware stores you should be able to find just about anything you need in Swakop.\xa0For a real treat keep driving past Walvis Bay to Pelican Point. More bird wildlife and stunning salt flats are to be seen here.''Stay:''To see the wildlife in Walvis Bay I suggest an''Airbnb''rental in either Swakopmund or Walvis Bay.''The\xa0Seals of the Skeleton Coast''120\xa0km north of Swakopmund\xa0is the\xa0Cape Cross Seal Reserve. Here you can find one of the largest colonies of Cape Fur seals in the world! We debated long and hard about making the special trip to see the seals and subjecting\xa0ourselves to\xa0the smelliest place in Namibia, but eventually decided that we couldn’t miss the sight even if it was just a bunch of smelly seals.''As soon as we arrived it was obvious we had made a great call. I could have never of expected the sheer number of seals that were at the reserve. Not just thousands, but tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of seals were here flopping around, “honking” at each other, and basking lazily in the sun. We visited in mid-November which unbeknownst to us was breeding season, so that meant thousands of newborn pups too! Some of the pups were only a matter of hours old. If traveling Namibia in November it is an absolute must.''Good to know:''The Cape Cross Seal Reserve is a protected area in Namibia. To help with conservations foreign visitors are required to pay 80 NAD to enter. We stayed for about an hour, but if you have a weak stomach the smell may get the best of you. I recommend bringing something to cover your nose with. And most importantly plan to burn your clothes after…''Stay:''To see the seals I suggest camping along the way or staying in Swakopmund and driving up.''Namibia’s greatest\xa0wildlife spectacle''Etosha National Park''is not only the\xa0top wildlife destination in Namibia but one of the best game parks in all of Africa. The park is only a four-hour drive from the capital city, Windhoek, making it easily accessible for people on a short trip to the country.''The massive Etosha Salt Pan covers a large swath\xa0of the park and it is a sight to see. There are hundreds of different mammals and bird species in the park. The park is also home to the Big 5 (Rhino, Elephant, Leopard, Lion, and Buffalo).''We spent two days in Etosha and had amazing sightings at just about every watering hole. Our favorite sighting was at the Gaseb watering hole just after passing through Okaukuejo. We arrived around 10 am thinking it would be too late to see anything, but decided to hang around just for kicks. Within ten minutes giraffe, ostriches, oryx, zebra, jackals, wildebeest, and impala had all come to get a drink. We watched with excitement for over 30 minutes barely wanting to leave. We told each other we would return to the Gaseb watering hole at sunset to see if there was any new activity for the day. Good thing we kept to our word for when we returned there had been a lion kill with hyenas, jackals, and vultures waiting for a chance to eat.''The key to seeing a variety of wildlife in Etosha is to set up camp at a watering hole and wait for the animals to come for a drink. It’s exceptionally hot here so animals often flock to where the water is. Other watering holes that we found interesting were Chudob and Ngobib near the Von Lindequist\xa0gate.''Good to know:''Etosha National Park is one of the most affordable parks in Africa at 80 NAD for foreigners. The park opens at sunrise and closes at sunset. For the best chance to see wildlife I recommend avoiding midday in the park. The animals get as hot as you and will be hard to spot as they hide\xa0from the sun.''Stay:''To see Etosha I suggest not staying in the expensive campsites in the park and instead at Gondwana’s Etosha Camp near the Anderson Gate or Onguma Campsite near the Von Lindequist gate.''Check the online map for more details.''If you want to recreate our visits to the various game reserves and wildlife sightings around Namibia, here’s a map to help you get there:''Any visit to Namibia is bound to bring you one step closer to some of Africa’s best wildlife.

It can be tough to keep your diet in check on the road — a lack of routine and all the delectable local food options can tempt even the most devoted of healthy eaters to splurge on high-calorie treats.''But a vacation or long-term travel plan doesn’t need to cost you an extra 15 pounds. Here are my top 10 tips on how\xa0to eat healthy while traveling.''Focus on your veggies''If you do one thing, this should be the thing. If you make an effort to eat your daily requirement of vegetables, you’ll find less room for the stuff that isn’t as good for you.''Try eating a salad before you dive into that amazing Italian pizza or Mexican queso fundido — you’ll get some good fiber into your system before the carbs and fat come calling. When you try to get the healthy stuff in first, you’ll naturally have a little less room for the waistline-expanding options.''Eat like the locals do''Local Eats in Vietnam''Traveling is about experiencing local flavor. That local flavor includes healthy options too! Trust me, the French are eating more than just cheese and croissants, and the Italians aren’t eating mountains of pasta every day.''If you look closely at the daily diet of the locals, you’ll usually see lots of lean protein, plenty of fiber-rich vegetables, and little processed food. Step out of your comfort zone and try more than just the uber-famous dishes of the country that you’re visiting. I’m sure you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how healthy food is done all over the world, particularly''Vietnamese food''!''Try to only''eat''your calories''Tempting… but don’t do it!''This means things like fruit juice, soda, and energy drinks should go out the window. They lack the fiber necessary to make you feel satiated, so they end up being empty calories.''If you’re an OJ fanatic, eat an orange instead. It will help you feel fuller longer, and you’ll still get the citrus kick you love.''Limit your alcohol consumption''This one is a toughie for many of us who like a good glass of wine, are beer enthusiasts, or party animals (I may or may not fall into all three categories).''I’m not saying to go stone cold sober, but maybe try to lay off the sauce''a couple''nights per week. The old adage about alternating water and booze also helps with both calorie count and hangover prevention. Enjoy your travels and drink if you like to, but try to mix in some moderation.''Stay hydrated''Your best friend on your travels''While we’re talking about hangovers, let’s talk about water consumption, too. Keeping yourself hydrated is one of the easiest ways to make sure your body is sending you the right signals.''It’s easy to assume you’re hungry if you’ve gone all day with only one glass of water. Keep a reusable water bottle clipped onto your backpack or daypack and''use it''all day. It’ll help you feel full between meals and you’ll have more energy.''Don’t let yourself get hungry''A healthy snack option on the the road…''I’m one of those people who can go from “fine” to “hangry” in about 2.5 seconds. And when I’m in hangry mode, I’m looking for the most calorie-laden meal I can get into my belly''immediately''.''Prevent this situation by always having a few healthy snack options handy. Nuts, fruit, and even certain types of cheese (in moderation) can help stave off the hunger pangs until you can get your next meal. Always keep a few in your daypack to break into when you can’t get a real meal.''Get that lean protein''Fish, seafood, and chicken dishes tend to be a little healthier than their beef and pork counterparts, so try to center the majority of your diet around these protein options. Fortunately, nearly every culture and country has some''amazing''methods of cooking these meats, so you won’t have to sacrifice flavor for your waistline.''Swap pasta for rice''A balanced meal in Indonesia''Backpackers the world over will groan at me for saying this, but try to avoid eating too much pasta while on the road. Instead choose rice, such as brown, basmati or other long-grain or wild rice. The reason? Most store-bought pasta is processed, and many include trace amounts of sugar. If you’re noshing on pasta every day, that can start to add up. Rice bowls loaded with lots of veggies and chicken or fish are easy''hostel-kitchen meals''you can cook for yourself. Just be sure the majority of the meal is veggies and protein and not rice!''Try to avoid the deep-fryer''Of course, you won’t want to avoid this''completely''. Beer-battered fish tacos in Baja California, street doughnuts in''Hoi An'',''kwek-kwek in Manila''… even the healthiest of cuisines have a few deep-fried specialities – and they are worth trying! Just don’t make them the backbone of your diet and instead focus on grilled, steamed, poached, or roasted cooking methods for your daily meals.''Don’t be too strict with yourself''You’re traveling for life experience and to enjoy yourself, so don’t put yourself on a crazy diet regimen and beat yourself up if you can’t stick to it. Cut yourself a little slack and indulge once in awhile! I firmly believe that a little indulgence is part of a healthy diet. As with anything, just be sure there is''balance.''And have fun!''Do all these tips seem pretty obvious? That’s because they are! It’s not that hard to keep yourself full and healthy while on the road. In fact, it’s crucial to make an effort to do so. You’ll need plenty of energy for exploring all the amazing places you’ll be visiting, and it won’t happen on a diet of junk food.

The word ‘Sukhothai’ means ‘Dawn of Happiness’ (so appropriate – you will find out why, soon), and it was''the first truly independent Thai Kingdom'', founded over 700 years ago.''From Bangkok, you can buy tickets at major bus stations, and take an 8-hour long bus ride to Sukhothai.

Trust me when I say that you’re about to embark on a wonderful adventure that can open so much more of the world to you. There are so many mind-blowingly beautiful places\xa0on the planet where a car can’t take you, and hiking, (or trekking, backpacking, or whatever you want to call it), is the only way to see them.''Surviving a multi-day backpacking adventure\xa0isn’t about being the fittest person on the trail. It’s not about being the most experienced, either. It’s about will power, endurance, and most importantly of all, enjoyment.''So don’t worry if this is your first time backpacking\xa0and carrying gear, because with the right preparation, you can do it! Everyone was a first-timer\xa0at some point, right?''From a girl who has done everything from 1-day to 14-day treks, these are my best backpacking tips for beginners:''What to wear''Hiking in the''Dolomites, Italy''What you wear on a hike should first and foremost be functional.''Shoes''Your shoes will be one of the most important pieces of gear on your trip. Running shoes are appropriate sometimes, but waterproof hiking boots are much better. Try them on in person (in lieu of that,''I recommend these''), and make sure that you''break them in''before you take them on a multi-day hike. Do a few hikes or take some walks around your neighborhood first. The better they are molded to your feet, the smaller the chance of blisters. Additionally:''Get shoes that have just a little bit of extra room for your feet to swell.''Tie your shoes super tight. Tighter, tighter! The less movement your feet experience in the shoes, the less likely you’ll have the friction that causes blisters.''Bring''very thick socks''If it’s tropical''Standing on top of''Mt. Kinabalu'', a 2-day trek in Borneo''tropical hikes can get pretty hot and sweaty, so breathable fabrics are your friend, as are layers that you can put on if it rains.''The thickness of what you bring depends on the nature of the hike. Will it be through the jungle? You probably don’t need a jacket, then, but you probably will want to cover your legs and arms to help combat mosquito bites.\xa0If you’ll be gaining any kind of altitude, bring along a layer because even in tropical climates, going higher means getting colder. I suggest you bring:''Breathable rain jacket (in cute colors!)''Leggings''– they’re appropriate for almost every hiking situation''A colorful and supportive sports bra''that can be worn without a shirt if you get hot (and it’s culturally appropriate)''Tank top''or thin long-sleeved shirt''If it’s cold''Taken on a day hike in''El Chalten in Patagonia''The key to comfortable backpacking\xa0when it’s cold is layers. If you might encounter snow, bring along at least two layers for the top and the bottom, and:''A waterproof and snow-proof jacket''. If you have a ski jacket, that’s perfect''water-wicking pants''Ski underwear''Leggings''Beanie''or sweatband''Warm gloves''If it’s\xa0longer than 2 days''Brace yourself, this sounds icky, but if you’re on a long trek that requires that you carry everything that you’ll use, including food, a tent, and sleeping bag, etc., it’s best to just bring two changes of clothes: one for sleeping, and one for hiking. Believe me, I know that it’s not fun putting sweaty hiking clothes back on in the morning, but there is no point in bringing extra clothing because within 5 minutes of hiking in the morning what’s going to happen? Your clean clothes will be all sweaty too.''Don’t worry, everyone is in the same boat. Two sets of clothing is all you need. I would, however, bring enough underwear to change regularly, and at least one extra pair of socks just in case.''What to pack''What I brought on the 8-day circuit in''Torres del Paine, Chile''The most important thing to prioritize when packing for a hike is to keep the weight down, especially if you have to carry everything with you that you’re going to use, like a tent and all of your own food. This is all the sturdy, weather-proof, and reliable equipment that I use:''Shelter''Your tent and sleeping bag are super important, especially in inclement weather. You can definitely scrimp and save when it comes to hiking clothing, but make sure you invest in a good tent that won’t break in heavy winds or rain. The last thing you need midway through a trek is a broken tent! I use and recommend:''MSR tent'': It’s super lightweight but has sturdy tent poles''A sleeping bag that will keep you warm''Note, wearing more clothing in the sleeping bag will not make you warmer. It actually makes the sleeping bag less effective because the heat then has to go through more layers to reach your body. Invest in a good sleeping bag. Being cold at night is no fun!''Lightweight but thick sleeping mat''Instead of carrying around a pillow, I suggest balling up your jacket and using it as a pillow instead.''Food''Picking Calafate berries on the 4-day''Huemul Circuit''in Argentina''If you’re hiking for multiple days, the key to a light pack is bringing food that is light and/or can be rehydrated. Here’s my typical menu:''Breakfast:''Oatmeal/porridge with chocolate powder, milk powder, and dried fruit''Lunch:''Dried fruits and nuts (high in energy, low in weight and easy to snack on as you go)''Snack:''Chocolate (reward yourself a little), granola bar''Dinner:''Pasta with powdered sauce, cous cous, powdered mashed potatoes with a bit of cheese and sausage bits, or a''dehydrated meal''that you can add water to.''To warm you up:''Powdered chocolate for hot chocolate, powdered soup, and tea bags''What NOT to bring:''Canned goods, liquid sauces, or food that takes a long time to cook, such as rice. All of those add unnecessary weight to your pack. Remember, in most cases you’ll have to pack your trash back out with you, and cans are heavy and bulky.''For cooking:''Foldable, light pot''that doubles as a pasta strainer''Decent knife''foldable stove''(attach gas canisters. If cooking food that doesn’t take long to cook, bring 1 per 3 days)''Your pack''Day two on the Huemul Circuit in Argentina''The best thing you can do is try your pack on in person and make sure that it fits comfortably with weight in it. Stores like REI have dedicated staff just for this purpose. Make sure it fits comfortably around your waist and distributes the weight in such a way that is comfortable for your back and shoulders.''The size depends\xa0on the length of your hike and how much of your own gear you need. For example, in Nepal where I stayed and ate in tea houses, I brought a small pack since I didn’t need a tent or food. In Patagonia for the 8-day circuit in Torres del Paine, however, I brought a 70 liter bag,''like this one'', and it was full, weighing in at about 17 kilos (approx. 37.5 lbs).''Incidentals that will make your life easier''Bug spray: If you’ll encounter mosquitoes, this is so nice to have along''Steripen'': Just because you’re in nature doesn’t mean the water is drinking quality.

Like most sports, nothing can prepare you more than doing the real thing, and\xa0building up can only help you.''If you’ll be backpacking at altitude, do your absolute best to get some hiking in before the big trip. If you can’t do that, then get on the stair climber or the stationary bike at the gym and endurance train. The stronger you are, the more able you’ll be to climb hills and carry weight.''Other things that really help me are listening to music – the same music I’d dance to or listen to at the gym. Get a great offline playlist going and it will help out immensely. \xa0It’s also important to remember to drink water often, and eat if you’re hungry. In fact, by the time you’re hungry or thirsty, you’ve already waited a bit too long.''Most importantly, as I mentioned in the beginning of the article, it’s not about being the most experienced or fittest person on the trail. It’s really about mental endurance more than anything. As long as you keep up the positivity, you can do it, even if it seems like everyone is faster than you. It doesn’t matter, just honor your pace and body. If you need a 30 second break, then take a 30-second break and then get back up and keep going.''At the Thorung La pass on Nepal’s''Annapurna Circuit''You got this, and it’s going to be a beautiful experience in stunning surroundings! Most importantly, you’ll feel an amazing sense of accomplishment.''Note: Some of those links are affiliate links. If you make a purchase it costs you nothing extra but gives me a small percentage.

Sensational shopping, a stylish restaurant and bar scene and some of Asia’s best hiking routes cultivates in a perfect blend of East meets West.''Yes, you heard us correctly! For all you hiking junkies looking for a surprising yet compelling fix, Hong Kong and the surrounding islands are the perfect location to offer up your next hit.''We were particularly attracted to Lantau Island having heard from our''Chinese teaching''colleagues that it houses the famous Big Buddha statue and is a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. We were told to check out the Lantau Peak Trail in particular (the second highest peak in Hong Kong) and after only 1 hour of trekking, we were greeted by this sign to the right hand side of the track and our curiosity lead us to take a major deviation off the beaten path. We were later informed that this trail is unofficially titled ‘The Dogs Tooth Ridge Trail” due to its pointed peaks and valleys.''Aptly named, this trail takes you on a twisty, jagged journey on the tight crags lining the precipice of one of the tightly formed mountains. But be warned, this crossing is not for the faint hearted and coming from two adventure seeking souls who have previously taken on the''Worlds deadliest trail in China'', this must be saying something! We don’t know how we get ourselves into these situations, honestly! For those hikers that like their trails rigorous, rough and relentless and all for the love of the accomplishment from completing the expedition, then this ones for you.''The first 500m see’s you scrambling over rocks and boulders, so it is advisable to bring a pair of gloves, if only we knew beforehand! As you pass along the ridge, the views to behind of Shek Pit reservoir are ones to be savoured. The lush green valley below deepens the higher you climb and the narrow crags of the rock face make for dazzling views along either side of the mountainside, making for one of the most overwhelming hiking sensations we’ve ever experienced.''As you scale the ridge further, Lantau’s prize asset will come into view. While most tourists have jumped off their tour bus crammed into the viewpoint square to admire the 34m high Tian Tan Buddha statue, on the trail you are all but a solitary figure peering over the valley, taking in the panorama from above. It really is something to be able to view such a highly populated attraction from the serenity of the mountainside.''As you venture steeper, you will pass one of the trails most difficult endeavors, ‘A Slim Chance Of Survival’, again rather suitably named! This section can be recognized as the trodden path turns into a cliff face with two paths meeting either side. Push through this part of the trail and you will be rewarded with a less strenuous 60 degree climb before rejoining the Lantau Trail at ‘Tsim Chai Au’, standing some 810m high. At this point, you can either turn right and scale Lantau Peak ascending a further 120m, or choose to descend to the left to where you will reach Ngong Ping, the Big Buddha viewpoint and the''cable cars''to Tung Chung.''Having completed the trail, we were still looking to add to the day’s adventures. Walking past the tourists that swarmed the Big Buddha, we headed for the main road. Still way above sea level, we marveled at the waves as they lapped at the shore in the distance. We continued down the winding roads towards our next stop, Tai O.''A tiny fishing village located on the west side of the island, Tai O remains untouched by the western world, providing an insight into authentic Hong Kong. The quaint village is one of the last traditional Chinese fishing villages in Hong Kong and it stands proudly on stilts above the South China Sea. Throughout the day, you’ll notice the tide drifting in and out beneath the seemingly make shift homes.''As you stroll through the streets, you’ll first be met by the pungent smell of fish as it hangs to dry outside of the shops, it’s also renowned for its shrimp paste, although we weren’t brave enough to try it for ourselves''Many of the locals offer boat rides from the harbor for around 20HKD, allowing you to witness an active fishing port as well as admiring the picturesque village from the water. If you’re lucky, you may also catch a glimpse of one of the rare pink dolphins that reside in Tai O’s waters, although we must admit, we were pretty unfortunate! If you fancy being a little more active, you can also rent a kayak and paddle through the blue waters.''How To Get To Dogs Tooth Ridge Trail''From Hong Kong take the MTR to Tung Chung Station.''Take bus number 11 or 23 and get off at Shek Pik police station next to the reservoir.''Walk back the way you have just come for 500m until you see the country park. Go through the metal barrier and follow the path until you cross the bridge about 150m after the gates.''Head up the steps and you’re on the Lantau Peak Trail. Continue walking for an hour and after 3.5km (the distance covered is signposted) you’ll come to the Shek Pik reservoir viewpoint. On your right you will see a red sign telling walkers that there is no entry, this is in fact your starting point and the gateway to Dogs Tooth Ridge Trail.''At the end of the trail if you wish to visit Tai O village, you can walk, although this does take a while (and we stupidly made this mistake so you don’t have to), or you can get the bus from outside the Big Buddha statue that will take you straight there!''Lantau Island offers a much needed breather from the luminous delights of the urban landscape and who would of thought that a hiking haven exists outside of the concrete jungle!

I could feel my heart rate increase slightly as the excitement coursed through me at this discovery of why travel is so addictive.''I’d always known that newness – new places, the anxious anticipation\xa0of stepping off an airplane in a faraway land, the novelty of trying a new food, and the humbling feeling of discovering a new culture – gave me a shot\xa0of dopamine, but I never realized that there was concrete science behind it.''I cradled a\xa0glass of seltzer water in my hand, suddenly disinterested in the sip I was about to take. I was engrossed in our conversation that October day in cloudy Manhattan as I sat opposite my friend, Jon Levy, who had put a heavy amount of research into it for a book he wrote,''The 2 AM Principle: Discover the Science of Adventure''.''He was referencing an experiment conducted by researchers Nico Bunzeck and Emrah Düzel of\xa0University College London and Otto von Guericke University, respectively, who conducted a study of people’s brains using an fMRI while they were shown things that were new to them\xa0as well as things that were familiar.''They found that the more novel something was to the person, the greater the response in the hippocampus, which is the brain’s learning center, and the amygdala, the center for processing emotional information.''So basically, all this time, when people thought I was crazy, shirking responsibility, running away, or chasing a carrot at the end of a stick, there was a perfectly good explanation: We are hard-wired to crave newness.''I can attest. Seeing this in''Ireland''for the first time had me all kinds of stoked''After our conversation that day I was inspired to read Jon’s book. He’s about my age, has a lot of solo traveling experience as well, and has a background in behavioral science.''He’s also a master networker\xa0and adventurer and since I fancy myself an adventurer as well, I had to see if I’d agree with his advice on the topic.''His book is basically a road map of how to pursue newness and adventure. He leaves very little off the table and after trying a lot of his advice independently (and before I even met him), I can definitely agree with much of what he says. Here are a few of the points we agree on:''Say YES more. Nothing truly interesting or exciting happens at home.''WORD, Jon. This is why I don’t own a TV and unless my intuition is screaming, “NO!” I say yes.''Saying “yes” is what led me to a''crazy karaoke night in Malaysia''where I sang in front of people for the first time in my life, it’s what got me on a''motorbike for the first time''and what made me''climb the highest mountain in Southeast Asia''on a whim.

Yerkes and John D. Dodson in''Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology way back''in 1908, Jon’s point is an important one: test your comfort zone, but don’t do something that makes you so terrified that it paralyzes you or clearly puts you in harm’s way.''That’s why solo traveling is perfect to test the waters of adventure, and to try something slightly out of your comfort zone that at the same time, stimulates you in a way that few other things can.''Jon’s book''goes into way more detail with more studies about the human brain, hilarious stories from Jon’s adventures and his best tips for replicating them, including but not limited to how to assemble an idea adventure team, how to talk to celebrities, and how to push the limits without going over them.''It was pretty cool to finally learn about the science of adventure, a lifelong love affair of mine, and the reasons behind my insatiable wanderlust.''*Jon, as mentioned in the intro, is a friend.

Savory grilled pork, tart pickled veggies, and fresh herbs are set next to a pile of rice vermicelli noodles. Pour on a little''nuoc cham''sauce, mix together, and you have a dish that kicks flavor around every corner of your mouth.''Pho Bo or Pho Ga''If you haven’t\xa0heard of this hearty and delicious noodle soup, you must be living under a rock. Thin strips of beef or chicken\xa0cook in a boiling hot broth laden with wide rice noodles. Fresh bean sprouts, chilies, and a whole mess of fresh herbs accompany the broth, so you can load the bowl\xa0to your taste preferences. The servings are huge, and I can attest to their ability to cure a hangover.''Roast Duck''This dish really lets its Chinese influence shine. It\xa0is essentially China’s Peking Duck, adopted by the Northern Vietnamese centuries ago. Hanoi is dotted with shops that proudly hang the bright orange ducks in the window, with the delicious rich smell wafting onto the street and beckoning you inside. Once you’re there, you’re served thin slices of perfectly-cooked meat with a crispy, crackling skin. Try not to drool as you dig in. Trust me, it’ll be a challenge.''Bahn Mi''This famous Vietnamese sandwich is''everywhere''in Vietnam, and it’s equally popular in Hoi An and Saigon. But it''technically''originated with French settlers in Hanoi. This sandwich is world-famous for a reason! \xa0Crusty baguettes encase a whole host of savory fillings and spreads, crunchy fresh veggies, and a healthy hit\xa0of chili to keep everything spicy. There are a hundred ways to have this sandwich, but for me, there’s only one: Pate, barbecued pork, fresh cilantro, carrot and daikon, and a healthy dose of chili. Bahn Mi 25, an unassuming cart in the Old Quarter of Hanoi, does this particularly well.''Bia Hoi''Bia hoi is a unique Northern Vietnamese beer that is allegedly brewed in the morning and is only good to\xa0the end of the day. While that may or may not be true, you can’t beat the price of this yeasty, foamy beverage — usually $0.25USD and under!

Do not miss this one!''Cao Lao''I love food with a good story, and''cao lao''delivers. Only water from a secret well on the outskirts of Hoi An is used to make the buckwheat noodles that are the base of this dish. Only a select few know the location of this well, and they are the noodle masters. Fortunately, this beef-and-noodle dish is readily available on street carts and menus all over Hoi An city, so the noodle masters aren’t stingy. It’s the warm blanket of Vietnamese street food — one small bowl will warm and fill you up in no time.''Hoi An Won Tons''These are almost like Vietnamese nachos. If the chips were filled pork.

I love a good won ton, and Hoi An manages to take a Chinese classic to the next level.''White Rose''If you like your food to be as pretty as it is tasty, don’t miss White Rose. It’s a shrimp dumpling, but it’s made with such artistry and delicacy that calling it a dumpling seems sacrilegious.

Dipped into some hearty peanut sauce, it reaches a new stratosphere of deliciousness.''Com Tam''Rice is to Southern Vietnam as noodles are to Northern Vietnam, and this “broken rice” dish is a street food staple. It’s made with rice grains that have broken during harvest, which creates a softer, slightly stickier texture. You can find''com tam''topped with any variety of protein and veggie combinations, but the barbecued pork and fried egg variation is the best. Bonus points if you can find one with pork cracklings!''Bahn Bao''This little pillows of perfection are found on street carts all over Vietnam. A rice bun wraps it’s airy arms around minced pork and a hard-boiled quail egg, and the result is a party for your tastebuds. One of these makes the perfect afternoon or late-night snack, and two could substitute for a full meal. The contrast of textures from the fluffy steamed rice bun and the dense meat-and-egg filling is a dining experience you won’t want to miss.''Canh Chua''If''pho''is Northern Vietnam,''canh''is Southern Vietnam. The word''canh''encapsulates a whole host of tamarind-brothed sour soups famous in the south.''Canh chua''is a variation famous in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam. It features whitefish common to the Mekong River, pineapples, tomatoes, garlic, shallots, and a handful of those ever-present fresh herbs.

It was a vulnerable post, and one I was afraid to share, where I talked about how I reached the heaviest weight I’d ever been at and that even though everyone seemed to lose weight when they travel, I just seem to pack it on.''It took a toll on my self esteem. It made me feel like I wasn’t beautiful when I’d look in the mirror and see someone looking back at me who barely fit in her clothes anymore. I feared that I’d be super uncomfortable for my upcoming trips to''the Maldives''and''Burning Man''and knew that I had to make a change.''It turned out that a lot of people have the same struggles as I do, and it was through posting that article that I realized it. Today I want to share how\xa0I’ve lost the majority of the 15 pounds I was carrying around and have been able to get some musculature back too.''It wasn’t nearly as hard as I thought, and what I did is easy to replicate. Here’s how I lost the weight:''I changed my mentality''Lost about 10 pounds prior to Burning Man''I wanted to make changes to myself physically, but part of that change had to come from my mentality about my weight.''I couldn’t be loathing myself while trying to love myself enough to be healthy, go to the gym, and keep up hope and motivation. I had to stop hating the person I saw in the mirror and instead used my reflection as motivation to put the hard work into getting fit again.''So when I noticed that clothes didn’t fit anymore, or when I felt like I wasn’t making any progress, I stopped getting frustrated or upset, and instead just told myself that I could and would make progress. I believed it was possible, because it IS possible, for everyone.''Working out a lot more''Keeping active whenever possible''Isn’t the hardest part about working out just getting the motivation to start a fitness regimen? Gosh, it sure is for me. Once I’m in it, it’s easy to keep going. I come to adore the endorphin rush and I love the body changes too. I like getting stronger and finding exercises that are fun for me.''The most crucial\xa0part is finding an exercise that’s fun for you rather than a chore. For me that’s spin classes, dancing, and Pilates. Since I’m on the move a lot, I do the following:''Blogilates'':''What I love about Pilates is all you need is a mat and a little bit of space and the rest is just down to using your own body weight as resistance. It’s amazing how effective it is without any weights or equipment. I love Cassey Ho for her upbeat attitude and challenging videos, and it’s almost all free on YouTube. If Pilates isn’t your thing, then search other exercise forms on YouTube that you think you might like better. There are tons of free options!''Groupons'':''I’ve been getting groupons now for yoga and pilates studios so that I can keep fit anywhere I go. At first I was worried about not understanding in the local language, but so much of working out is just watching what the instructor and other students do, and suspending my ego.''Walk more:''When I got back to Berlin, I decided to walk a lot more instead of taking a train or bus.

Back when I lived a healthier lifestyle, I only ate food that started with raw and unchanged ingredients. It doesn’t have to be expensive or take tons of time. These days I usually cut up some veggies and maybe some chicken, and drizzle with olive oil and arrange on a baking sheet. 30 minutes later, boom, food’s ready.''Cutting out carbs:''My diet is mostly plant based with meat thrown in now and then. When I travel, I just order things without the bread or look for menu items that are mostly just meat and vegetables. When I cook at home, I like clean eating recipes (''here''and''here''are a month of recipes I like from Buzzfeed). I definitely still “cheat” now and then and just eat what I want so that I can try the local food, but it’s once per week now instead of once per day.''Drinking way less alcohol:''This is probably one of the biggest parts of why I look and feel better. In South America, I indulged in wine pretty often. A couple of glasses per day didn’t seem like a big deal. I wasn’t getting drunk so it wasn’t that unhealthy, right? What I didn’t consider were the empty calories and the dehydration.''Though I still struggle to find the time to exercise all the time when I travel, it’s a lot easier for me to maintain my body as long as I’m eating healthy and taking part in active experiences whenever I get the opportunity.''I’m not all the way where I want to be yet, but I’m a lot closer than I was in May.''Have you been able to find ways to lose weight even when you travel?

Yes, it’s a catch 22, so I suggest finding a “WG,” which is a shared flat, and joining their lease.''This website''and Facebook housing groups are both good places to look.''Then, bring the lease, the extra verification, and your passport into the Burgeramt and you’ll be given a stamped document called an Anmeldung. Find a very safe place to keep this!''2) Make an appointment at the''Ausländerbehörde''This is the ‘foreigner’s office’ where you’ll get the visa.''It usually takes a few weeks to get an appointment at this office as well. You can also try your luck and just show up without an appointment, which I’ve done and found was alright, but just consider that it’s a lot like the DMV too, which is to say that spending any amount of time longer than you have to there is like getting punched in the face, slowly.''3) Get a bank account''Walk into any main bank branch and set up an account. If you need an English speaking bank employee to help, this may require an appointment, which you can make in person. Bring your Anmeldung and your passport.''4) Get health insurance''You must have health insurance in order to apply for and to maintain a visa in Germany. Normal travel insurance won’t cut it.''I use''ALC,''which the office has accepted for all three of my visas and extensions. I’ve also made several claims with them and have been pretty happy with the service and found it easy to get reimbursed. I am also able to choose the doctor I want to see as long as I ask them to approve it first. I like this method!''Hanging out in Kreuzberg''5) Organize your documents''The main point here, as emphasized above, is to prove that you can afford to live in Germany and that you won’t cost the system money but rather, you’ll be paying into it. You can do this through a combination of savings in your bank account and future contracts. The more cash flow and savings you can prove, the better.''The documents you’ll need depend on what kind of work you do. As an artist, you’ll need a portfolio of your work and proof that it makes you money. The best kind of proof is contracts (or if you’re a tattoo artist, for example, appointments for your work). You need a business plan, profit and loss statements (best prepared by a local accountant), and all of the necessary licenses for your profession as well.''Since I applied for a freelance visa, which is slightly different, I didn’t need the business plan.''This is what I brought:''A portfolio of my work''I earn my living through this blog, my''Instagram'', and''my book''(more on''how I do it here'', if you’re interested). I needed to prove\xa0that this obscure kind of job actually pays my bills, so I printed out my blog’s homepage, samples from other websites I regularly wrote for at the time, and all of my social media channels. Basically everything that makes me money was represented.''A copy of my Bachelor’s Degree from University of California, Santa Barbara (go Gauchos!)''Future contracts''This is the most important thing, because you have to prove that your income is consistent. I’ve heard that the magic number is €800/month but that’s just hearsay. I’ve also heard that it’s particularly helpful to have contracts in German with German companies, but I didn’t have any of those and it didn’t impede my ability to get a visa.''Financing Plan and Revenue Forecast''Find the template\xa0at the end of this list and make your own''CV and cover letter''Bank Statements''For this one, I included a full year’s worth of my financial history in the US, plus evidence of my bank account in Germany. I wanted to make absolutely sure that they saw I had cash in addition to my future contracts. Remember, you have to prove that you have enough money\xa0in case your contracts dry up. Obviously, it’s best if you actually have the cash. If you have a relative wire you some cash a month or even a few days before you have the appointment, that’s not going to look very good, right?''Antrag auf Erteilung eines Aufenthaltstitels''This is the application form for first-time applicants''2 Biometric passport photos''There’s a booth in the\xa0Ausländerbehörde that I highly suggest you just pay the €6 for (in exact coins!) prior to your appointment. They will be picky about the photos and it would be a drag to have to come all the way back just because your photos aren’t the right ones.''All forms and templates, examples, and health care requirement information can be found''here''.''Anything else you can provide, like recommendation letters, can only help. It also really helps to have these documents very well organized in a binder with those individual plastic pages. Make it look as nice as you can.''It also really helps if you bring along a German speaker with you if you don’t speak German yourself. Though I’ve gone to the office a couple of times without a friend along and been OK, it’s just much easier if you speak the local language.''6) Settle in and wait''It will take time. You will probably be issued a Fiktionsbescheinigung (say that ten times fast!) in the interim to extend your Schengen visa and allow you to stay in Germany. This does not, however, allow you to work yet.''I personally waited four months for my visa, which was OK because my work is online, and not dependent on German companies. However, if you plan on freelancing in Germany, just make sure that you can wait out this period, and register for your VAT tax ID immediately once you do get the visa so that you can start billing clients.''It’s not the easiest process\xa0but if you qualify for the visa, it’s fairly straightforward and then you get to live in a country with one of the strongest economies in the world, a high quality of life, and the right to live in Europe for more than 3 months at a time. I can dig that.''Please note that this is entirely based on my experience, does not substitute the advice of a professional or a lawyer, and I am not qualified to answer any questions related to visa laws or obtaining your visa.

You want to post photos that make people say, “wow!” and to have something beautiful to print out and frame, or to look back on in 20 years fondly.''The key to that, so often, is in the editing:''How to make this''Look like this''Learning how to edit my travel photos has been the big game changer between them looking just ok, and looking amazing. Sure, you do have to know a thing or two about how to use your camera, how to shoot, and how to develop your ‘eye’ (click here for my best''tips on how to take better travel photos)''. Those things have all improved for me over time and research,\xa0both of which are necessary to become better at photography, but editing is just as important.''In this tutorial I’ll show you exactly what I do to make my photos pop, even in less-than-desirable light situations and even when my camera doesn’t quite capture what I feel I saw with my eyes.''To edit my travel photos, I use Lightroom on my computer. It’s the most user-friendly program I’ve found and you can learn it fairly quickly.''You can get a 12-month membership for''Lightroom and Photoshop here'', or you can get a''disc or PC download here''(affiliate links).''What’s the difference? With a membership you always have access to the newest updates, and this one is for both programs, though you’ll have to renew annually. Also, if you have a MacBook Air like I do, you don’t actually have a disc drive! Pick based on what serves your needs the best.''By the way, I still have an old version – Lightroom 4 – but the following tips will work with any version that you have.''Next, follow these steps:''Straighten''Lining up the horizon so that it’s sraight''I almost always end up having to straighten my photos and knowing that I can do this when I edit\xa0makes me stress less about getting it straight every time in the moment. All you need to do is select the crop and straighten tool and move the angle dial until it looks right. This is also a good chance to cut out anything you don’t like in the photo by cropping.''If you want to create a nonstandard size, click that lock button and you’ll be able to move around the dimensions by clicking and dragging as you see fit.''See how auto works for you and tweak''Click that button''Quite often, hitting that auto button does everything I want it to do for me, and I just go in and tweak a few things after. In this case, it changed the exposure, shadows, and highlights a bit. I wanted the shadows to be even less pronounced so I moved that dial to the right (this is a stylistic preference and not every photographer would agree with me on that. That goes for just about everything I suggest from here forward).''Play around with the whites, blacks, highlights, and shadows and see what looks good to you.\xa0It helps to accentuate the brightness of certain things rather than the entire photo, like changing the exposure would.''I almost always try\xa0‘punch’''Punch it up''On the lefthand side, you’ll see a few different options which are basically filters for the photo. The only one I like is ‘punch,’ which turns up the clarity and vibrance and alters the tint slightly. In this case, I didn’t end up liking the clarity so I slid it back down to zero. In some cases, like with street art, clarity is pretty cool. In others, sliding it in the other direction makes it look more etherial.''Individually play with the colors''Rather than moving up saturation for the entire photo, I strongly suggest moving individual colors instead. You’ll see the options to slide the scale for individual colors when you scroll down on the righthand side.''You can even change the colors themselves with the hue and luminance functions. This is particularly handy if you want to make fall foliage pop more, or if you want certain colors to stand out.\xa0The more you change it, the less it will look like the real version that you saw in person, but art is subjective and you can always do multiple versions of the edits for different purposes.''Use the paintbrush feature''The paintbrush feature\xa0is\xa0my friend''This is one of my favorite tools in Lightroom, because you can click on the paintbrush and make all of the changes we just mentioned on individual parts of the photo. I almost always individually edit the sky, turning up clarity to make the clouds look more defined, and in this case, I turned up the temperature and tint as well to give more color to the sunset sky.''I also clicked ‘new’ when I was done so that I’d have new settings, and lightened the foreground just slightly by painting then turning up the exposure. This is also a great tool for when you want to lighten a person or a building when the sky is bright but they turned out dark, or to change the saturation just in one part of the photo. It makes\xa0things look more natural.''The finished product''The difference between the edited and non-edited version''A few other quick tips:''You can click ‘copy’ on the lefthand side if you want to use this same edit on multiple photos. If you have a bunch all in the same spot with the same lighting, why reinvent the wheel, right?''I like a lot of color in my photos. This is just a stylistic thing, and others like it to be more monochrome. This editing tutorial is just based on how I like mine to look, but the more you understand the settings, the more you can come up with your own style.''Everything in moderation. For example, before you turn the green all the way up, make sure the other parts of the photo can handle it and don’t look ‘noisy’ or pixelated.''Shoot your photos in RAW format so that the files have all the colors and pixels available to you/your camera. You can find this in settings (more on that''here'').''This is YOUR art and these are YOUR photos and however you choose to make them look is perfect for you, no-matter what anyone else’s opinion is.''Happy editing!

Whether you are enjoying the day’s end from a beachfront BBQ restaurant, or from the comfort of a lounger, cold Bintang in hand overlooking the Java sea, the sunset is not to be missed.''While there are a number of ways to enjoy the sunsets on Gili Trawangan, the most famous has to be the Trawangan sea swings. Cast into the bedrock, rustic looking trunks of wood act as the perfect frame for both the swing and your photograph.''We’re all too familiar with the picture perfect Instagram shots strewn across our social media feeds of these exact spots, but being the adventurous souls we claim to be, we found ourselves on the hunt for another viewing point.''Having set foot back on the island having dived in the afternoon at the aptly named dive spot Shark Point, we couldn’t have timed it better to begin our search for sundown. Renting two bicycles in the late afternoon for around $3 each we chased the sunset to the West of the island.''Careering through the isle we were greeted by children as we passed through local communities, gawped at travelers and locals bonding over a game of football as we passed the football pitch and followed the beaten path past the burning rubbish heap, laden with livestock foraging for food. No doubt they were seeking out the waste from the catch of the day!\xa0Everyone on this path is heading for the same place, the sea swings, but as usual we weren’t content with following the crowd.''Just before you meet the main strip that runs parallel to the shore, you’ll notice on your right hand side a perimeter fence running around the islands lighthouse. Those with a particular sense of awareness will also notice that the gate is in fact open. If this isn’t an invitation to the best seats in the house for sunset then we don’t know what is, well that’s how we tend to look at it anyway. No need to RSVP here, we were in!''Staring toward the top of the platform, some 200 steps up we were about to embark on an adventure all in itself. As if diving with sharks wasn’t enough adrenaline for one day! Strapping a plastic bag of Bintang beers to our waists, we ditched the sandals and climbed the ladder rungs barefoot, only stopping at each podium for breath.''Access to the platform is easy and there is plenty of room to hoist yourself from the last step into the viewing deck. If you are not already breathless from the climb, you sure as hell will be from these heights and with these views!''From this point you are able to get a 360 degree, almost birds eye view of all three Gili islands for as far as the eye can see.

In all of the chaos below, the chatter of friends, the clucking of animals, the beats from the beach clubs and the whaling of the mosque, it was so peaceful to watch island life unfold from up here. This is an observation deck after all!

This was allowed with AT&T for 6 months at $10 month, which finished out my contract. \xa0It’s not ideal, but it’s better than the $75/month I was previously paying. \xa0The phone will still be locked, but you can use it with wifi only, which is still useful. \xa0You can then buy a cheap local phone with a local SIM''B: Put your phone on a disabled plan and use a shady 3rd party website to unlock it.

In the cases that they don’t I just remove my current SIM, match up the edges, and cut. \xa0It does’t have to be perfect, it just has to generally fit (and make sure you’re only cutting the plastic part).''How to find a SIM card''There are a few ways to find a SIM and it depends on the country.''In''Thailand'', they can be easily purchased at 7-11. I personally use DTAC, and I buy it directly at the DTAC store. They tend to have locations in big cities such as Phuket, Chiang Mai, and Bangkok. 4G is widely available, and data plan runs at about 100 baht for 1GB worth of data valid for a week. One must also buy the SIM itself for around 50 baht, if memory serves. \xa0There were no language barrier issues.''in''Cambodia'', Metfone is the most popular network, and you can find the flagship stores in major cities. 1.5GB worth of data valid for a week costs just $1.5. There are no 7-11s in Cambodia, but SIMs can be bought at smaller cell stands as well. \xa0There were no language barrier issues in Siem Reap.''In''Laos'', it was a little less straightforward. \xa0I paid around $10 for a SIM and found that the data ran out fairly quickly. I never found a cell store there and just bought from a nondescript stand. I wish I could be more helpful here, but I was pretty disconnected in Laos and didn’t worry too much about it.''In''Malaysia'', it is not as cheap to stay connected. There are a few good companies and you really can’t go wrong. Most malls there sell the SIMs which include data and some calling and texts. \xa0Since most Malaysians speak English quite well you shouldn’t have much issue getting a SIM. With the country’s largest network, Maxis, 1GB worth of data valid for a week costs about $2.5.''Indonesia''still baffles me a bit. \xa0In Medan, I bought a SIM with the 3 network for only $3, and the 3G never ran out over the 6 weeks that I lived there. \xa0I still don’t understand why because the man I bought it from spoke no English and at the time I spoke almost zero Bahasa. \xa0However, it only worked in major cities. \xa0Simpati was the best bet for the islands, such as Lombok and Bali, but I had to reload it constantly. I found that small amounts ran out very quickly, but as soon as I put USD$10 on there, it lasted for a while. There’s also usually a service fee to reload, so might as well do it infrequently. \xa0This can all be handled at cell phone stands and convenience stores.''With all of the SIM purchasing scenarios,''make sure the 3G is fully functioning before walking out of the store''or away from the stand. It’s often not as straightforward as just popping in the SIM and you may need some additional help setting up the network.''There you have it.''The ins and outs of buying a SIM are actually pretty straightforward'', but just take a little bit of know how in some countries prior to purchasing. \xa0If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask in the comments section.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''The Best Books to Read For Traveling in Asia''What to Pack for Backpacking in Southeast Asia''What 6 Months of Traveling in Southeast Asia Cost Me''Here’s a globetrotter style secret: one scarf is all you need to pack in your suitcase – truly!''Pack along a neutral scarf that makes a statement, and it’s bound to be the most versatile and powerful accessory in your travel wardrobe.''I’m an Arizona girl so the concept of scarves (and the elusive art of tying them) was LOST to me when I arrived into this thing they call''seasonal weather''when I moved to Europe.

After all, we leave home to experience the culture of countries that we visit. So why wouldn’t we share a little of bit of our own culture while abroad? There’s no better time to do this than on Thanksgiving.''How to Celebrate Thanksgiving on the Road''What do you do when you don’t even have turkey in the country you’re visiting, let alone an oven to cook it in? Get creative! The core of Thanksgiving is gratitude for the abundance in our lives, and that doesn’t have to mean abundant turkey. In fact, Thanksgiving can be so much more fun when you blend it with the flavors of the place you are visiting.''An Asian feast can be your Thanksgiving meal this year!''No turkey? No problem! Feature a meat that’s prominent and reserved for special occasions in your temporary home. Slow-cooked pig is a specialty in Bali, a whole steamed fish is reserved for special guests in Vietnam, and there are dozens of special vegetarian curries for holidays in India. Any of these can take the place of a giant roasted bird at the center of your table. If you’re craving roasted poultry, whole chickens can be found almost anywhere in the world. In fact, my first Thanksgiving in Sydney featured roasted chicken because I didn’t realize that turkeys were hard to find outside of Christmastime!''This may not be your average turkey, but it’s the Vietnamese equivalent!''Don’t have potatoes for mash? You can probably find taro in Asia, or yuca root in South America. With a little creativity, either can be just as delicious (or even better!) than traditional russet potatoes. Look for a starchy root vegetable at the outdoor market — you might surprise yourself.''The possibilities are endless…''Or scrap trying to recreate the perfect American meal and ask each of your friends to bring a dish from their homeland. My friends tell me stories of incredible hostel Thanksgivings with dishes from Argentina, Germany, South Africa, the Netherlands, and beyond. What a fun way to experience many cultures while sharing your own!''Note from Kristin:''I did just that one year in Berlin, and as the only American at a table of people from Germany, Hungary, France, and Vietnam, I was really touched by how much everyone got into it!''Celebrating Thanksgiving\xa0Down Under''One of my favorite holidays to celebrate when I lived in Australia was Thanksgiving. It’s a holiday that revolves almost entirely around my favorite thing — food — and it was a completely foreign concept to my new British and Aussie friends. “You make a''pie''out of''pumpkin''?” they’d ask incredulously. In Australia, pumpkin was a name for squash, and pie was a meat-filled pastry you’d pick up from a corner shop if you needed a quick lunch. “Just you wait,” I’d tell them with a knowing smile.''In my adopted home of Sydney, the third Thursday of November was a day just like any other. But on the Saturday following, I’d spend the entire day in the kitchen, mashing potatoes, boiling down (shockingly difficult to find) cranberries into sauce, and trying to convince a large special-ordered turkey that it fit in my Australian-sized oven.''Who knew these would be so hard to find? Finally found some frozen ones in Australia.''Recorded American football games would play on the television, and my friends would arrive with their delegated side dishes and copious amounts of wine. Fortunately, I knew\xa0several fellow expats who managed to creatively source the ingredients for more traditional side dishes, so my foreign friends were treated to American culinary delights like\xa0green bean casserole, candied yams, and that infamous pumpkin pie.''Did it get warm running the oven on a sweltering Sydney summer day? A little. But it was fun to explain the historical significance of Thanksgiving to the non-Americans and to share one of my favorite family traditions: telling the table what we are thankful for before we all got stuck into our turkey and gravy.''Making the Perfect Turkey''So maybe you’ve managed to find a turkey and an oven and want to share it with your fellow travelers — but you’ve never roasted a whole turkey before in your life. As the official cook for Thanksgiving and Friendsgiving, at home or away, I have a few tips that will help.''Season, Season, Season''Sprinkle loads of kosher salt and cracked black pepper over the skin and''inside''the cavity of the turkey before you stuff it. It’s a step many people skip and it can mean bland meat. Brushing a little olive oil or butter onto the skin before you season it ensures plenty of salt sticks, which means crispy, delicious skin.''Butter''Butter is your friend! I think this one trick is why my turkey is never dry. I soften a couple of sticks of butter, chop up a bunch of herbs (sage, rosemary and thyme are all legit), mix it into the butter, then stuff it beneath the skin of the turkey. It melts as the turkey roasts and infuses into the flesh — so good.''Nix the Stuffing''Before you freak out, stuffing can still be a staple in your Thanksgiving feast — you’ll just make it in a dish instead of inside the bird. I prefer to stuff my turkey with halved heads of garlic, quartered onions, sprigs of rosemary and thyme, and maybe a quartered lemon if I’m feeling sassy. This does two things:''Cuts down your overall cooking time because the turkey isn’t full of a solid block of soggy bread''Steams all those yummy flavors into the meat of the bird. Butter from the top, steamy garlic from the bottom… yum!''Get Your Timing Right''In general, 11 – 13 minutes per pound is the rule of thumb for roasting a turkey in the traditional manner (it may be longer if you decided to stuff it). The''only''way to know if it’s truly cooked is to use a meat thermometer in the breast and thigh. It should read 165F/74C when the turkey is truly cooked through. I usually take it out when it’s a degree or two lower, because it will continue to cook while it rests (which you should do for 30 minutes before you cut into it).''The New York Times has an awesome guide on how to cook a turkey''here''.''Recipe: Sinful Seven-Ingredient Mashed Potatoes''If there’s any time of year you should be able to splurge on a heap of carbs served with bucketloads of dairy, it’s at Thanksgiving.

Fold the foil over the garlic and pinch together at the top, sealing each garlic head into an airtight package.''Place foil packets in the preheated oven and roast for 40 minutes, or until the garlic cloves are tender and slightly browned. Allow to cool.''Squeeze the garlic out of the skins into an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use.''Make the Mash''Peel the potatoes and cut in half or quarters so that all pieces are about the same size.''Place potatoes into a large stockpot and fill with water until they are covered at least an inch. Generously salt the water and place the pot, covered, on high heat.''Leave the potatoes boiling for 10 – 15 minutes after the water comes to a rolling boil (when the potatoes crumble when stabbed with a fork, they’re ready to go).''Drain the potatoes and place back in the empty stockpot.

Around every corner, there’s something new to make you gasp in awe and even if there weren’t tons of gorgeous waterfalls and awesome beaches along the way (but thankfully there are), the drive itself would make it worth it.''Though it can feel a bit precarious to drive at times, thanks to the 600-plus turns on this 64-mile road, you simply haven’t seen Maui if you haven’t driven the road to Hana. The little surprises, small towns, powerful waves and the dense jungle vines growing all around the road\xa0make it feel\xa0like being transported into the''Jungle Book,''minus the talking bears.''I drove the road by myself, and by carefully picking and choosing the best places to stop and by leaving early and beating the crowds, I was able to have one of Maui’s most popular attractions more or less to myself. These are my best tips and favorite stops on the road to Hana:''Safety Tips''The road to Hana is partially famous for being a dangerous road to drive. I’m not talking cliff edges and vertical drops, but there are a lot of blind corners, narrow bridges, and hairpin turns. In order to stay safe, practice the following precautions:''Don’t stop on or along the road''unless there is a parking lot. A narrow turn-out does not constitute a parking lot.''Don’t feel the need''to get anything more than a basic sedan, even if the guy at the rental company tries to upsell you. You don’t need it!''Do go early in the morning''so that you can beat pretty much all of the traffic and other tourists. I departed the Haiku area at 6am.''Do go into it with at least 3/4 tank of gas'', just so that you don’t have to stress.''Do bring food''along if you go early, since the roadside stands won’t be open by the time you reach them''Don’t expect to get cell service''. Plot your points ahead of time on an offline map, or even better, download the''Road to Hana Gypsy guide'', as he’ll warn you with plenty of time before each attraction.''Do go slowly, yield,''and pull aside for locals when possible. They’ll be going much faster than you.''Of all of those tips, perhaps the most important is to go early. If you are uncomfortable with the thought of other cars being on such a narrow road with you, and if you want to maximize your time without worrying about big crowds or having to skip attractions, setting off right as the sun rises is the best way to make it happen. The early bird gets the worm (and the nice morning lighting for photos).''Early Stops''Most of the big waterfalls and impressive black sand beaches are later on in the drive, so for the first hour or so, just enjoy the road and get as far along as you can to keep the crowds way behind you, especially if your objective is to do the Pipiwai stream trail hike:''Twin Falls:''A lovely albeit smaller waterfall early on in the drive around mile 2. The trail can be muddy and since it was pouring rain when I drove by, I didn’t end up stopping, but after''consulting google images''I kind of wish I had.''Huelo Lookout:''This stop is super quick and easy, offering a nice panoramic view. There’s also a set of toilets at the parking lot. You might as well stop here, it’s worth 5 minutes.''Waikamoi Ridge Forest Trail and Overlook:''This one is a 30-minute hike and generally folks who have done it report that it’s just OK. You won’t find any waterfalls and it’s mainly a walk through the trees. I skipped this again because of the pouring rain.''Garden of Eden:''This is where the opening scene of''Jurassic Park''was famously shot. They’ve planted 500 species in this garden and it gives you a nice view of some waterfalls as well. However, if you follow my advice and leave early, you’ll have to miss this one (and the $15 entrance fee) since it doesn’t open until 8am. I prefer to see the wild nature rather than things that have been planted, but people do generally really enjoy this one. It’s your call!''Must do #1: Keane''Right around mile 17 there’s a turnoff to the left for Keane Peninsula. It’s easy to miss (which is why I was glad to have the Gypsy guide considering there was nobody else in the car to guide me), but it’s a very worthy stop, full of jagged volcanic rocks along the coastline and massive, powerful waves crashing up against them.''I especially loved the contrast of the greenish-blue water against the intensely green grasses and black stones.''The powerful waves''This is when the sun came out on my drive, giving me a full arc rainbow and thankfully staying out for the remainder of the trip!''After this you’ll turn back out and rejoin the road the way that you came in. It’s a small detour and only took me about 20 minutes, mainly because I stopped for a while to watch the waves and take photos. You could do it much quicker if you wanted to.''More stops nearby:''Aunty Sandy’s Banana bread''is located right on the peninsula and is the best place to buy banana bread, so I was told. Again, if you take my advice and go super early, it won’t be open yet by the time you reach Keane. If you really want this banana bread you might want to leave later so that you can experience it, but trust me when I say if you want the State park and bamboo forrest not to be mobbed by the time you arrive, go early and make peace with missing this.''Halfway to Hana snack shop''is popular simply because it’s halfway down the road, I stopped to get some cash out of the ATM and continued on my way.''Wailua overlook:''Just before this overlook on the right-hand side, which almost nobody seems to realize is there, is a tiny parking lot with an awesome view of several waterfalls and the\xa0Haleakala crater. Scroll up and look at the first photo in this post and you’ll see what I mean. The Gypsy guide will tell you when to pull off for this one. The overlook is just a half a mile farther up on the other side of the road, and gives you a view of Keane, where you just were.''3 bears waterfall:''This is a popular one and appears to be three different cascading waterfalls, at least normally. Before\xa0I arrived in Maui\xa0it had been dumping down rain at unusual rates so it was just one giant mass of waterfall. I did a slow drive-by, but if you want to park and take a look you’ll need to continue on the road until the larger pull out and walk back.''Nahiku Ti Gallery and Coffee Shop:''You can’t miss this one. It’s a set of food vendors and a coffee shop on the left side of the road with plenty of parking. The food is really expensive, and as I warned if you leave early, not open yet anyways by the time I arrived. I did get a latte, though!''Must do #2:\xa0Wainapanapa State Park''This is what we’re getting up so early for''This! This park at mile 32 is the reason why I set out so early on the road to Hana, hoping to get to it before there were swaths of people. When I arrived the parking lot only had a few other cars, and I was able to selfie away on this beach with out anyone else around.''There’s tons to see here, like the cave just to the right of where I snapped this photo – something that I think a lot of people actually miss:''Giant sea cave. I love these things!''Plus trails that run along either side of the black sand beach with panoramic views of the sea arches and cliffs over the water:''You can expect to see this and so much more''This is something I’d suggest really spending some time at, and not rushing through. It’s one of the most gorgeous spots on the road and really, how often do you get a black sand beach, two sea arches, and a cave that’s big enough to have a dance party in all in one spot? I’m willing to bet it’s not very often.''A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Oct 14, 2016 at 2:32pm PDT''I spent over an hour walking along the trails and exploring the park. Since\xa0it\xa0is so amazing and popular on the road, it’s usually full of people, especially in the water and on the beach. By the time I left, which was still pretty early in the morning, the parking lot was almost full and tour vans were pulling in.''In that moment I knew it had been so worth leaving before the sun, missing out on the banana bread, and being one of the first people to reach the park.''More things nearby:''Hana:''Though the road got its name due to this being the terminus, it’s actually nothing all that special. There are some beaches nearby that are, though, especially if you surf''Hamoa Beach:''A lovely red rock and yellow sand. Usually pretty crowded but not at the time that I was there''Must stop #4: Wailua Falls''Right after mile 44, there’s a parking lot just off the left side of the road where you can pull off and check out this several hundred-foot waterfall. Apparently it’s usually pretty popular, but I was the only one there since I had steadily managed to stay about an hour ahead of the crowds all day.''Park and pop over to the other side of the road to marvel at this one for a minute or two, it’s worth it.''You can also take a trail down to the bottom of the falls, but I had a date with the seven sacred pools, which I also wanted to get to before the tourists, so I kept going.''Must stop #5:\xa0Seven sacred pools and bamboo forest''7 Sacred pools''Just beyond Hana, you’ll come to another national park, this time with a $20 entrance fee that also gets you access to the Haleakala crater.''Usually, you can walk down a pretty short and easy trail to the seven pools which are open for swimming. As I mentioned before, the water levels were dangerously high and they were closed, but that meant I got a rare, impressive view of the falls in this powerful state as they poured out to a raging sea.''From there, you can hike to the bamboo forest and usually the\xa0Waimoku Falls. At the time that I visited (October 2016), the trail to the falls had been washed away by the flooding water and I couldn’t go all the way to see the falls. The trail was closed right in the middle of the bamboo forest, about 3 miles into the hike.''My favorite photo from the Road to Hana''I can’t pretend like that wasn’t super disappointing, but the hike up to the bamboo forest was not too tough, and I was really glad that I went for it anyways after seeing the gorgeous forest. The waterfall will just have to be for another time.''I still got all of this more or less to myself and was so glad to have left so early in the morning, especially considering that most people miss this part of the trail because they leave too late, run out of time, or are too tired by the time they get there. What a big mistake! Seriously, make sure that you do this one. It was the cherry on top.''After this, most people turn back and go the way they came. The road continues along steep cliffs, hairpin turns and one-lane roads again. Most car rental companies will also tell you that you’ll void your rental contract if you continue and if you do have an issue, you’ll be paying dearly out of pocket for it. It’s your call, though it is discouraged (tbh, though, I kept going).''Those are my best tips for the road to Hana.

It isn’t covered in resorts, and you won’t see many other tourists here. It’s rugged, rocky, orange, and rustic.''The entire island is about 140 square miles and there are no traffic lights.\xa0In sharp contrast to the resorts of''Maui''and the efforts I took to avoid the crowds there, on Lanai I rarely saw another person. I rarely saw a paved road, either.''Pu’u Pehe, aka sweetheart rock''It was my\xa0Jeep, Jasper (he needed a name, right?), and me adventuring around the island most of the time, taking in Instagram-worthy sunset views solo and enjoying the total silence, unless I did want to talk to people, which was easy to do at the B&B I stayed at with its live music and friendly staff.''My noble steed''I felt the family vibes all around, and noticed that people always waved when they passed me on the street. It felt good to be so welcomed and to be transported back to the past in a way, to a time and place in Hawaii where people still know and recognize each other, and acknowledge that in passing.''These were a few of my favorite activities on Lanai:''Manele Bay''Check out these tide pools!''This is the busiest place I encountered during my stay in Lanai, which is to say there were a few people around. This is mainly thanks to the Four Seasons nearby – the only resort on the island – and the day trips from Maui.''I still didn’t have to share the tide pools pictured above with anyone else during the 20 or so minutes that I spent swimming around in the warm water (and''taking selfies''like the one above, admittedly).\xa0From here you can snorkel or do beach dives, which can be fun if you like technical dives with swim-throughs.''This beach though''If you keep walking, you’ll see Pu’u Pele, or sweetheart rock, depicted in the first photo of this post. It’s a massive orange rock rising out of the ocean and is frequented by dolphins. Whether you see them or not, the sweeping views from the surrounding cliffs all the way over to Maui on a clear day are lovely.''An unspoilt Polihue Beach''Though the tide is way too strong for swimming, unless you’re crazy, Michael Phelps, or both, this 3-mile beach is unlikely to have anyone else around and is the perfect beach to have all to yourself.''On a clear day, you can see all the way to Molokai and on a particularly lucky day, there are seals and turtles around.''Just me!''I kept thinking a beach this clean, with such soft yellow sand and gorgeous views, would be absolutely packed on almost all the rest of the islands. Never mind that the waves were coming in sideways (have you ever seen such a thing!?) people would still be storming the sand with umbrellas and drinks with paper umbrellas.''On the way you’ll pass\xa0Keahikawelo, or the Garden of the Gods, which is a rock garden full of boulders and towers.

It was very rocky and steep but that’s the whole point of 4-wheel driving right? And without anyone in the passenger seat to say things like, “this is a bad idea!” I had a blast!''It’s a lovely sunset spot''Though the drive back up such rocky terrain after dark was all new to me, pulling off partway to see the glorious stars and taking in the sunset to the very last drop were such a treat.''golden hour with a lighthouse in the distance''Just drive''The views are gorgeous just about everywhere. Get in the car and just go. Head over to shipwreck beach and drive the coast over to Lopa, or head to Kaumalapau harbor for another great sunset spot. Just get out and explore! It’s awesome for getting just a little bit lost down those rough roads.''Molokai in the distance – the views are awesome''I returned the car the next day beaming, the girl behind the counter genuinely excited that I enjoyed my solo adventure in Lanai so much.''Even if you don’t have experience driving on 4×4 only roads (like me), and even if it’s a little daunting, don’t let the adventurous side of Lanai scare you. I’m so glad I went for it!''Pin me!''Stay:''Hotel Lanai''is the only locally-owned guesthouse on the island, and it’s also significantly cheaper than the $1k per night''Four Seasons''(but hey, go for it if you’ve got the cash!). The food there is excellent and I loved the friendly staff and quaint atmosphere. Plus, it’s a local favorite and sometimes there’s live music.''Drive:''Definitely rent a Jeep!

You don’t have to. Whether jetsetting across the world or''backpacking through Patagonia'', here are my five totally lazy girl tricks that will keep your hair glam everywhere in the world.''Create a Lazy Girl Hair Kit''I have six major components to my lazy girl hair kit at all times – a basic headband, four bobby pins, four hair ties, curling iron, dry shampoo and a hat when times get desperate.''This simple kit is portable and easy to haul across the world. A headband or hat goes a long way and are my most used accessories when on the go or traveling\xa0 – it’s is an easy way to create the illusion of being polished and put together even when you aren’t falling apart (because, jet lag).''Overnight Braids for Morning Wave''Putting your hair into a braid at any length every night is not only a way to prevent face breakouts and hair damage, it’s an instant hairstyle the next morning. To achieve this look I divide my hair into two sections on each side and create loose braids. I sleep on it overnight and finger through it in the morning – the result is beach-worthy waves and effortless glam.''Tip: utilize that volume for a flawless messy bun the next day.''Worship CTC: Cut, texture and color''One of my biggest mistakes when I became a travel blogger was growing out my hair senselessly because I thought it more photogenic. The reality: it had no movement and was just a giant curtain of comfort which I found myself hiding behind in photos – mistake – and all because I succumbed a bit to the societal notion that longer is''more''beautiful.''In order for your hair to be travel-ready on the go, you need to be realistic about the length that flatters you most and add textured layers for volume and enhance your natural color if needed – it goes a long way when simplifying the styling process daily.''Nail Down Your Signature 10-Minute Hairstyle''Every girl needs her signature quick “completely put together” look and for travelers with an endless hustle, it’s better if achieved if under 10 minutes. Brainstorm your favorite hairstyle – a messy bun, a French braid, curled and voluminous, or gorgeous beach waves – and try to nail down the routine to a short ritual that works in all settings.''Mine: After washing my hair, I add some''Bumble and Bumble’s sea salt spray''to my roots and throughout my hair and scrunch it my hand, put it in a high bun and let is dry overnight – about 3 minutes and some sleep. The next morning I finger through it and using a medium-barrel curling iron, add about six curls on each side – about 7 minutes. That’s my 10-minute secret, now discover yours.''Utilize the Power of Dry Shampoo''Washing and drying your hair is one of the most time-consuming aspects of hair care and frequent washing is actually damaging. If you aren’t on the dry shampoo bandwagon yet, it’s time to start. This is an essential for every traveler and girl on the go and will quickly rescue hair from too many washes or dirty hair.

Ultimate freedom in a place as raw and adventurous\xa0as Hawaii sounded like a dream come true.''When the opportunity came up for me to work on a photography project in Hawaii, I jumped at the chance to check it out solo, confident that more than a honeymoon destination, Hawaii can be a great solo female travel destination, too.''Turns out that it totally is! These are some of the best activities in Maui, plenty of which will give you opportunities to meet other travelers, and enjoy a few solo adventures\xa0too:''Road to Hana''This famous road has over 600 turns, and though some of them are hairpin turns on a one-lane road, as long as you take it slow and go before the other tourists are on the road, you’ll be just fine.''You can expect to see this and so much more''The Road to Hana has quickly become one of the most popular activities\xa0on Maui since it takes you through some of the dreamiest landscape on the island, including waterfalls, black sand beaches, jungles, and a bamboo forest.''I did this one alone, and was glad to have all of the time and space that I needed to really do it justice in the way that I wanted to.''One of the many waterfalls on the drive''You won’t have cell service out there, so I recommend getting the''Gypsy Guide for the Road to Hana''as it’s synced to satellite.

I’ve been resisting surfing for so long and I honestly don’t know why. I guess I just assumed it would be difficult and I’d be battling it out with a bunch of guys who are way better than I am.''Maui Surfer Girls made me feel so comfortable with the whole experience. The waves on the side of Maui that they teach on (Olowalu Beach near Lahaina) are nice and small, the views of the green mountains as you ride the waves in are beautiful, plus\xa0I had plenty of room to learn.''To my surprise, I was already standing by my second wave, and rode two all the way in during my two-hour lesson. Having the female-friendly, non-competitive environment that these lessons provided just made me feel good, and the surf camps they offer make it easy to meet other female travelers too! Try some''Maui surf lessons''out, it’s a blast, really!''Snorkeling the Molokini Crater''Met awesome folks on this boat''This was actually my first activity on the island and I was surprised by how easy it was to make friends on the boat. Even though people were there with their significant others, they were friendly and I ended up chatting with and making friends with people right from day one. I also found the crew to be particularly friendly and easy to talk to, which made the whole experience great as a solo traveler.''The Molokini Crater is a crescent-shaped, partially submerged volcanic crater that is pretty famous for snorkeling and even diving. For me, the boat ride was the best part as being on the ocean is one of my favorite things in life. Jumping into the warm water, spotting an octopus, and swimming around just added to the fun.''Mermaiding''You have a few options for booking a trip like this, but I’d suggest a smaller boat. I saw some that appeared to have hundreds of people, while the''Alii Nui’s''max is 60 (but there were only 24 when I went last Monday). The food was excellent, the wine and beer were free-flowing, and it included a pickup and drop off at my hotel.''A few solo female travel tips:''Safety:''Thankfully Maui is pretty safe and most crime is limited to petty theft. That said, plenty of people on the island don’t even lock their doors so that’s a pretty good indication that it’s a safe place for solo female travelers. Just make sure that you lock your rental car (''book here''! By the way, despite what the guy at the rental place tries to upsell you, a compact car on Maui will do you just fine).''Meeting others:''It might be easier than you think. I hadn’t realized I already knew plenty of people in Maui. Post on your Facebook page that you’re heading there and you may be surprised who knows whom!''Consider using social media:''If you have an active social media account like Instagram or Snapchat, you might be able to find people that way.

But the reason why I harp so often on the importance of solo travel is because of moments like these, dancing in a room where nobody knows you, free as a bird.''When I travel solo, I don’t have to worry that the other person might not be having fun at the dance party. I don’t have to stay home that night because the other person doesn’t feel like going out. Conversely, if I feel like staying in, I don’t have to go out dancing. The beauty is I get to make the choice without feeling guilty or forced.''It’s all up to me. I have the world at my feet''Solo\xa0travel means being able to be completely selfish, and though the word ‘selfish’ has a negative connotation, everyone deserves to know what it feels like at least once in life to call all the shots.''When you travel alone, you get to ask yourself questions like,''“What is it that I really enjoy?''How do I want to spend this afternoon?''How do I want to spend the rest of my entire life?”''Sure, it’s a lot of work making all of the decisions\xa0on where to\xa0stay, where to eat, whether you can trust that person or should you take that train out of town to a brand new place?''Now we could approach this as a negative, always having to do all the work.

Southeast Asia has such cheap and delicious food lining the streets that a kitchen is a no-go zone. But in\xa0more expensive regions like Europe, Oceania, South Africa, and South America, cooking can be a huge money-saver if you’re trying to travel on the cheap. Here are ways to keep those costs low.''Make a plan before you hit the grocery store.''You don’t necessarily need a full menu, but be aware of how long you will be in one spot and which meals you’ll want to make yourself. Then focus on finding ingredients that can be shared across meals. Like spinach, which can be the green stuff on a sandwich and double as salad greens for dinner.''Veggies are your friend.''I find that certain produce items like tomatoes, onions, and herbs go a long way, and they’re cheaper than packaged items. Plus, you can find these veggies in just about any country in the world. Pro tip: if spices are non-existent, sautéing garlic and/or onions in oil or butter is a guaranteed way to make anything taste delicious.''Tasty fresh produce at the Borough Market in London''Watch your perishables.''Only buy enough perishable food for the number of days you’ll be in one spot. Trying to bring a carton of milk on a hot bus ride is a surefire way to spoil your trip (or stink up the bus).''Think one-dish meals.''Food that’s prepared in one dish means you won’t be the person hogging all the pots and pans in the kitchen at dinnertime, with the added bonus of fewer dishes to wash. Popping a chicken breast in the oven with some root veggies or potatoes makes a hearty and quick meal all on one sheet pan. Or throwing some tomatoes, cheese, and sauteed onion into some pasta with pesto sauce is an easy one-pot dish.''The secret to yummy food when the share shelf\xa0is lacking — garlic and onions!''Starch + Protein + Veggies + Dairy = Yum.''Rice and pasta are mainstays for budget travelers, but they’re often mistreated. To keep you fuller, longer, you need some form of protein mixed in. For carnivores, this means chicken, fish, beef, etc. For vegetarians, it means tofu, beans, nuts, etc. To keep this formula from getting bland, I like to introduce my secret ingredient in countries where it’s possible: dairy. A little queso fresco, grated Parmesan, or cream can take a meal from good to great.''The secret ingredient… a cheese MOUNTAIN!''Plan for portability.''You’re traveling, so you’ll be sightseeing, hiking, and generally doing things outside of the hostel. This is why sandwiches will always be your friend. Think cured meat and cheese, apple and cheese, or the good old-fashioned PB&J. Be careful with anything that will spoil in a hot backpack, like soft cheese or avocados. Nuts and fruit are easy and healthy snacks that you can pack along. You can also take non-perishables from place to place — so a box of pasta can take a solo traveler a long way!''Get colorful.''Aim to get as many different colors into your meal as possible. This packs a variety of flavor and nutrition into your meal, with the added bonus of making it look pretty.

The city is all about counterculture and the best part is you don’t have to look that far to find it.''When you’re here, typical things like the hop-on-hop-off bus, a visit to the parliament building, a walk along the East Side Gallery, and museum hopping on museum island are what you’re likely to hear about, but that’s not what you came here for, is it? You want the info on the cool stuff to do that tourists don’t typically know about. You want to rock up to the places in torn black jeans, not strappy sandals and a sock tan!''Don’t worry, as a 2-year resident of the city, I’ve got you covered. These are my top 10 best alternative things to do in Berlin for those who like to head off the beaten path:''Klunker Kranich''A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Aug 7, 2016 at 12:23pm PDT''Do you love live music? Do you love playing in the sandbox and sitting in the summer sun while drinking a fairly economical Moscow mule?''This is one of my favorite daytime bars in Berlin because it’s full of random art that changes all the time, and it’s got an incredible sunset view of the city.\xa0On a sunny day the decks and tables are usually packed with both locals and tourists out enjoying the views and vibes. While it may not be Berlin’s best-kept secret, it’s definitely one of the chillest\xa0ways to spend a lazy afternoon. When the sun is shining, you can often find me there.''To get there, head to the''Neukölln Arcaden'', enter at the post entrance, and take the elevator up to the 5th floor. It’ll open to a parking garage. Turn left and walk up the driveway and you’ll start seeing flower pots and cool little sculptures. Entrance is typically €2 and it’s open until 1:30am.''Book awesome places to stay in Berlin here.''Tempelhofer Feld''Inside the arrivals hall''How many abandoned airports right in the middle of a city have you visited in your life? Tempelhofer Feld is one of those unique spots that is just''so Berlin'', and on a nice day, you’ll see locals out BBQing, wind surfing on the tarmac, and even planting veggies in some of the communal garden spaces.''The airport best known for the Berlin airlift when this part of Berlin was under American control during the Cold War. Flights took\xa0off constantly to drop food to those in the walled-off Western Berlin. The history is fascinating and if you’re a lover of old abandoned buildings (like me) you’ll dig this.''Enjoying the outside of the airport is free and you can head there any time you wish, but if you want to see the inside of the airport, and you really should, book a cheap tour that allows you to learn about the history, jump behind the check-in counters, and transport yourself back in time.''Book a 2-hour tour here''.''Alternative Berlin Street Art Tour''Get ready to see some weird stuff''I’m usually not a tour person, but this walking tour really is excellent. The guides are not only sharp and well-versed in street art, they really seem to love it as well. To me it’s like a two-for-one, because it’s a history tour and an art tour combined into one, giving you a unique understanding of where Berlin has come from since it was a divided city.''I recommend this to every friend of mine who visits because it’s a great way to get your bearings of the city, and also an opportunity to meet other travelers. Whether you know nothing about Berlin and street art or already know a fair amount, you’re sure to walk away with some new knowledge.''Book it here''(affiliate link. If you book this tour I get a small commission at no extra cost to you).''Teufelsberg''In Teufelsberg, Photo of me by''Mike Corey''Teufelsberg, which translates to devil’s mountain, is easily one of my favorite parts of this city (well, slightly outside the city, to be exact). It’s built on top of a hill that used to be an\xa0under-construction Nazi military-technical college and rubble from the former east.''It was once a spy base for American soldiers during the cold war, as evidenced by the randomes, which are the huge, bubble-like listening domes pictured above. Though in tatters now, the\xa0spy base is still standing\xa0and is covered in street art. Some of the biggest names, like Jimmy C, have creations there. The whole thing is like some kind of weird, abandoned wonderland.''Unfortunately you can’t just walk up and explore as it’s now privately owned and there’s an entrance fee.''Book a half-day tour here''which includes transport and a guide. It’s worth it.''Thai park''Did you ever expect to find an authentic, street food-style Thai market in Berlin? I’ve got to tell you, it’s a seriously strange thing to speak a mixture of German and Thai to someone when ordering food, but once you get over the initial confusion of stepping into a mini Chiang Mai your taste buds will thank you.''Outside of''Thailand'', this is the most authentic Thai food I’ve ever had. Everything about it is just like the real thing, except for the prices of course. Most dishes run at €5 so bring some friends and share everything around.''The market takes place over the weekends at''Preussenpark''when the weather is nice.''YAAM\xa0Beach''The entrance to YAAM beach''YAAM is an acronym for Young African Art Market and is a popular beach club in Friedrichshain, near the East Side Gallery and other tourist favorites. Beach clubs like this are popular throughout Germany, and apart from sand, I can’t really tell you what makes it a beach club. The idea is that people of all ages and any ethnic background can come and hang out there, have a drink, and/or attend one of their many musical events.''There’s a bunch of very cool street art inside of YAAM beach, and for those in this techno-obsessed town who prefer live music, trap, drum n’ bass, hip hop, reggae, and Afro house, this is an awesome alternative place to come dance your heart out. Check out their''calendar of events''for yoga and musical acts.''Sunset on the canal''The canal that runs through Kreuzberg is a favorite for locals and visitors during the sunset hours. Buy a beer from the local späti (a small convenience\xa0store that sells drinks, candy, and the like) and take it over to the banks, especially in the summer months, and you’ll find that you’re in good company.''My favorite spot is at''Admiralbrücke''. Keep an eye open for the guy who peddles samosas, the swans, and the locals in blow up rafts\xa0selling beer.''Badeschiff''Photo by''Nate Bolt''used under creative commons''On a hot day during the summer in Berlin, this floating swimming pool on the river Spree is the place to be. Sure, it’s known by tourists and has a €5 price tag, but if you’re looking to meet cool people at the closest thing to a beach party that you’ll find in landlocked Berlin, it’s a great spot.''What many might not know is that it’s not only open during the summertime. Badeschiff is open during the winter, too, offering saunas and heated pools.''Urban Spree''At RAW''If you can’t get enough street art (and really, who can?), this spot next to the Warschauer str S-bahn station is full of it. Plus, there’s a lot going on there like musical events, nightclubs, a Sunday flea market, a rock climbing wall, movie nights, one of the biggest indoor halfpipes in Europe, and outdoor bars when the weather is nice.''It’s one of my favorite spots for street art gazing and hanging out. Just be sure to keep an eye on your belongings, as''pickpockets''have a field day there (and that goes for all of Berlin).''Bite Club''Bite club''is a summertime street food party that takes place every third Friday at Arena Berlin, which isn’t too far from the Badeschiff if you feel like combining noms and pool time.''If you’re here during the colder months and still want to find some great street food, check out the Markthalle Neun in Kreuzberg on Thursdays. It’s super popular, so prepare for crowds. You can also find great options all over the city''in this post''.''For your Europe Pinterest board''Those are a few of my favorites in my beloved Berlin, a city I’ve been seriously slacking on writing about, apart from telling you''why I moved here''forever ago and what''I love about the gritty underbelly''of the city.''Feel free to share some of your favorite spots in the comments, and let me know if you end up checking any of these out and enjoying your time here!''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Why Teufelsberg in Berlin is a Must-do''Inside Berlin’s Tempelhof Airport''Inside my Berlin Apartment''The light breeze makes my walk along German Street in Valparaíso, a port city on the Chilean coast, a little more bearable in the afternoon sun as I walk along admiring the colorful houses and ocean view.''There are kids sitting along curbs everywhere sketching. I can’t figure out if it’s a class assignment, or if this is just something that they like to do, but either way I love it. They’re applying their own impressions and artistic abilities to paper as they draw the houses, most with murals all over them, in their notebooks.''Valparaíso is a colorful menagerie of narrow alleyways, spray painted self expression, and colorful houses up steep streets. There’s plenty to inspire the kids, and this big kid as well.''This is not graffiti, this is fine art.''One of my favorite pieces''Later that day\xa0I round a corner after following a narrow set of concrete stairs, purely out of curiosity, and find myself in some kind of labyrinth of sound and art as people play music involving a didgeridoo in the distance, and paintings line\xa0the top to the bottom of every wall. It’s officially the funkiest alleyway I’ve ever been in and I am digging it.''Then, a voice enters my consciousness to my left as a local beckons me into his art gallery, where he offers me''hot mate''(mah-tay) tea as a friend offering. The gallery is more of a dilapidated room in an old house full of all manner of funky and inspiring sculptures and canvases. The ceiling is peeling and the floorboards creek, but he has a million-dollar view and it has charm. It’s obvious that it’s a hangout spot, and he tells me that it doubles as a vegan restaurant by day.''The alleyway that sparked my curiosity''I can’t believe a city like this exists. It’s characterized by tall and narrow streets with tall and narrow houses and funiculars, and in some ways reminds me of San Francisco, (which would make sense given its nickname is ‘little San Franciso’).''The entire historic district is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and it has more murals than I have ever seen in my life. I couldn’t find an exact count but safe to say it’s in the tens of thousands of individual paintings ranging from simple tagging to gigantic, elaborate murals.''One of many viewpoints in town''The graffiti scene in Valparaíso started as a form of protest against the dictator Augusto Pinochet. During that time, self-expression, including art and painting, was repressed. After the dictatorship ended, government officials decided to''make street art legal''and it blossomed in the city.''Why Valparaíso in particular?\xa0For that we have to peek back into history.''The port''Valparaíso was one of Chile’s major port cities in the 19''th''century given\xa0it was on the route that connected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by the Strait of Magellan. The construction of the Panama Canal in the late 20''th''century''caused an economic decline''in \xa0Valparaíso as the industry moved, and wealthy Chileans left for nearby Viña del Mar or Santiago while artists and foreigners remained.''Street art began to flourish in Valparaiso’s hills and alleyways due to the heavy artistic influence of the people living in the city. My guide on the''free street art tour''(highly recommended!) also mentioned that\xa0Valparaíso’s narrow alleyways made it easy for artists to tag the walls and make a quick getaway.''Colorful and eclectic''In present-day\xa0Valparaíso street art is not only encouraged but revered. Much of the art displays are mutually beneficial for both the artist and the hostel, restaurant, or shop owner. The artist is paid to create a mural and the hostel owner gets some beautiful, unique branding for his or her business.''Though the city never fully rebounded economically (watch your purse when you’re out! There are pickpockets galore), tourism thanks to the street art keeps the city afloat these days.''Major names display their art throughout the city,\xa0such as the\xa0incredibly talented, local''Inti Castro'', surrealist couple''Jekse and Cines'', Teo Doro who''draws inspiration from Van Gogh'',''Charquipunk''whose birds had me in awe, and I even saw 1up tagging there, a''street art crew from Germany''.''Pretty much everywhere you go, you’ll be surrounded by beautiful art''It’s the kind of place a fellow painter and art-lover like myself could have fallen back and gotten stuck in for a few more days or even weeks. The vibe was right, the sightseeing felt endless, and there was no shortage of inspiration.''So if you find yourself in Santiago, Chile, get on a bus and head west for a couple of hours.

I was doing what other people were doing that had brought them success, which worked eventually, but I could have gone farther more quickly by innovating.''What does the world need that it doesn’t have yet? What can you contribute that nobody else is contributing yet? What sets you apart from everyone else? If the answer isn’t clear, then just walk over to a mirror.

I love the outdoors, I love cultural immersion, and I don’t like all-inclusive resorts. I want something unique, I want to do things that are adventurous, and I travel alone. By default I turned into a solo female adventure travel blogger.

Since then, I’ve made a lot of mistakes (that I learned from, so it’s OK!) and a lot of wins, too. These days, my blog and associated activities pull in almost as much as when I was working in finance, but it wasn’t always that way.''How did I get here? If you’re just starting out, or trying to figure out how to grow bigger, this is everything I know about starting a blog as a business:''Know why you’re doing it''There are a multitude of benefits to running a travel blog: you have a chronicle of your memories, you can keep friends and family updated, you have a sense of purpose and work that keeps you stimulated (and your resume filled), or if you’re like me, you simply can’t''not''have a project you’re working on. It’s also pretty incredible\xa0to share your stories and find that people out there are actually interested. It blows my mind.''It’s a two-way street, too. You’re helping people whether by inspiring them and serving as their only source of support for a dream of traveling the world, or simply helping someone have a better vacation. With that in mind, whenever you write something or put your art out there, ask yourself what the ‘why’ is behind it, and you’ll have more success.''There’s a''great TED talk on the subject'', and it made me revolutionize the way that I ran my blog last summer. I developed a clear reason and direction for what I do, which is to encourage more solo\xa0travel. Every time I write, I think of the person\xa0(me four years ago, basically) who I’m writing to and whether or not it would serve her or him.''Know why you’re doing it, and love your reason, and it will still reward you in the beginning\xa0when you’re struggling to make money and feel like nobody’s listening. Eventually your hard work will pay off.''Don’t do what everyone else is doing''One of the biggest mistakes I made early on with my blog was not thinking outside of the box enough. I was doing what other people were doing that had brought them success, which worked eventually, but I could have gone farther more quickly by innovating.''What does the world need that it doesn’t have yet? What can you contribute that nobody else is contributing yet? What sets you apart from everyone else? If the answer isn’t clear, then just walk over to a mirror. YOU are what makes your site and perspective unique.''Think about what you love, and focus on that. The deeper into a niche you can go, the better you’ll do. You’ll find the people who also love that very thing, and they’ll be your initial fan base.''I originally wasn’t sure what my niche should be. I love the outdoors, I love cultural immersion, and I don’t like all-inclusive resorts. I want something unique, I want to do things that are adventurous, and I travel alone. By default I turned into a solo female adventure travel blogger. By making what I love and who I am the theme of my blog, I never really feel like I’m working, and the clients who I work with come to me because they know I’m an authority on the subject of outdoor adventures and female travel.''I wouldn’t have been happy focusing on luxury or budget or anything other than what I’m doing. Think about what it is that you love and would do even if nobody was watching. That’s where your ticket to success is.''A course is a worthwhile investment''If you’re new (or even experienced), naturally\xa0you’re not already an expert in blogging. For most of us, this is a brand new industry and even if we have a little know-how in one area, there are several others that we have to become good at: Social media marketing, branding, finances, pitching, writing, photography, and business management.''The great thing about starting a blog is how cheaply you can get started, at least monetarily. With that said it will take a boat-load of time, but you can cut that down and be much more effective if you have the tools to get it right from the beginning. That’s why I highly suggest investing in a course, particularly''this one by Nomadic Matt''. I’ve tested it, it’s helped me, and Matt is an awesome blogging coach. This didn’t exist when I started, so I learned a lot by trial and error that this course would cut out if I’d just known it from the beginning. Seriously, I can’t recommend learning the ropes first enough.''Consistency and volume''When you’re first starting out, be as prolific as possible. Write for anyone who will let you. Commit to a regular posting schedule and keep it up. This isn’t easy on the road but giving readers consistent material that they can look forward to, as well\xa0giving people more to look at when they do visit, will help you grow faster.''What can you realistically manage each week? Find a rhythm and stick to it as much as possible.''How to\xa0set up your site''WordPress is the most user-friendly blogging platform that I’m aware of. It’s free to download and fairly easy to navigate and understand.\xa0Here’s a''step-by-step guide''to help you out.''First, you need to pick a name for your blog. Blogs with the words “backpacking,” “nomadic,” and name-based blogs are pretty common these days, so think outside the box a bit.\xa0Do a bit of Googling and see what kind of competition there is for a name that you have in mind. I find the more creative, the better.''Next, make sure that the domain you want isn’t taken. You can do a quick search on any hosting website to see what is and isn’t available.''I pay for more expensive hosting these days since there’s a lot of content on the site and a fair amount of visitors, but in the beginning I did a cheap plan as it’s not necessary to pay more at first. At the moment''Bluehost''offers the best service. \xa0I would suggest springing for Domain Privacy Protection in order to keep your name, and especially address, private from the masses.''You have the option of signing up for one or multiple years of hosting. I’ve heard before that more years establishes more trust with Google. That said, Google’s algorithms are ever-changing so it’s really up to you what you deem best for your personal needs.''Themes''So you’ve secured your domain, bought hosting, and installed WordPress. The next step of setting up your blog is to select a theme, which is basically how your blog will look.''I started out with a free theme which I found by searching for free travel themes. I used it for almost two years before recently changing my theme to a cleaner look. The option you choose depends entirely on your budget and personal needs. A paid theme will have more support and will be easier to customize. Free themes also tend to have ads in the footers.''My new theme was purchased for $55 through''ThemeForest''. Because I had my site running for two years already, there were a lot of kinks to work out in order to make the transition. Starting with paid theme you love from the beginning typically eliminates this.''Most importantly, choose a theme that looks clean, without too many moving parts. \xa0Remember that you have limited time to interest people in your blog. If it’s boring, they may not be engaged. If there’s too much going on, they’ll click away. The confused mind says, “no.”''Widgets''Widgets and plugins \xa0help your blog run smoothly and help you promote your social networks. I use the following:''Digg Digg – an easy way for people to share your posts on social media''WordPress SEO by Yoast – search engine optimization made easy''Akismet – blocks most spam comments (and trust me, even in the beginning, you’ll have A LOT)''nRelate – get people clicking on your other posts by displaying them at the bottom of each blog''FD Feedburner Plugin – start an RSS feed on Google feed burner for people to subscribe, then install this plugin to help manage it''Google XML Sitemap – make it easier for Google to crawl your website''Social icons – these often come with your blog theme and will allow people to subscribe to your various social media channels''Lastly, Be sure to sign up for''Google Analytics'', which will document the statistics of your blog, and embed the code in the footer language of your theme.''And then?''Once you have everything set up and have an idea of what your niche will be, it’s just about getting started and persevering.''It will seem at first like nobody is listening, and it might feel like you’re pouring your hard work into an abyss, but if you are putting stuff out there that is unique, helpful, visually appealing, and compelling, then you have a fighting chance.''Learn all that you can about things like''search engine optimization'',''social media marketing'', and entrepreneurship. Network with those in travel blogging and parallel industries, and always think of it as a business. Be creative, love what you create, and stay engaged.''Those are the basics for getting started! Stay tuned this week and next for more posts on the things that I did right, the things that I did wrong (and what I learned from them), which blogger course is the best, and more insider tips that I wish I knew when I started out.''For those of you who have been on this ride with me for a while, thanks for being part of the journey.''Pin me!

I’ve thought about deleting it completely\xa0because it’s a topic that is not only super subjective, but also pretty sensitive not just for me, but for lots of people.''I write about personal stuff all the time on here but this is not just my feelings, it’s about disliking the girl I see in the mirror when she looks back at me and honestly that’s a tough one to swallow and especially to talk about at all. I know that some people will wonder why I’m complaining, and others might be struggling with the same thing. So I’m posting it for all of us, because sometimes knowing that you’re not struggling alone is the best way to move forward.''Traveling tends to make me gain weight, and though it’s been a struggle since day one, it’s a''big''struggle lately.''My weight tends to yo-yo. When I’m in one place, I’m laser focused on exercising and eating properly. When I’m on the move, it gets tough to stay so healthy.''Thank God for baggy clothes''When I was only finding super hearty food in''Austria'',''Finland'', and''Patagonia''for four months straight, it was pretty much impossible. Lucky for me those are cold places where I was wearing baggy clothing. It was hard to tell.''But then, I came back to spring in Europe and impending bikini season and my self confidence fell. It’s been a journey since then:''What I started with''I was a chubby kid when I was younger. I used to snack (and snack, and snack) all afternoon long after school. It didn’t matter that most of what was in my fridge at home was healthy, because at that volume the weight was bound to pile on.''As though some kind of “get out of obesity free” ticket came my way, I grew 6 inches in one year when I was 12 and went from a chubby kid to a really lanky and skinny teen. For the majority of my life since then I stayed active and watched my diet. It was easy back when I had a routine and even though I weighed about 130 pounds at 5’8, I wasn’t ever happy.''Back then I’d look in the mirror and see someone looking back at me who didn’t have a six-pack. I never had the exactly what\xa0I wanted. I never felt like I was fit enough. It didn’t matter how I actually looked, because I just didn’t see it. I saw everything that was wrong.''Now I look back at photos of myself from back then and I’m like,''what the shit was I so worried about?''I''did''look good.\xa0Why didn’t I let myself enjoy it? Because I didn’t look like the girls in the magazines? My god, they don’t even look like that either without epic lighting, and editing after!''Fashion magazines are total dicks, aren’t they?''Clever photo angles so you can’t tell''Unrealistic expectations + travel''Over the past few years, my weight has been subject to yo-yos when I have times that I’m stationary for a month or so, and times when I’m moving around constantly. I’ve never figured out how to stay fit if on the move. Even if I’m hiking, which I do all the time, it’s not enough to offset the food I’m eating. I’ve never been the type who can just look good without continuous exercise routines and hiking every two weeks while eating steak all the time will not cut it.''I tried traveling with a yoga mat for a while and committing to''working out every other day'', but I was staying in cheap dorms with fans in countries with 90-degree heat and humidity to match so that died out quickly. When Cebu Pacific airlines lost my yoga mat 2 months in that put the final nail in the coffin.''I googled ‘gaining weight abroad travel blog’ hoping for some solidarity and most of what I saw was blogs proclaiming that you won’t gain weight abroad. I saw 9 reasons why I’d lose weight (um, no), how losing weight was a perk of long-term traveling (nope!), and how someone else lost 25 pounds.''What I was reading\xa0made me feel like a fat failure, except for''a brave one by Alex in Wanderland'', thanks girl.''Maybe that’s the case if you didn’t work out a bunch at home and eat kale smoothies for lunch but that’s what I did back when I was a full-time Californian. I really had to work for it. When I was in the rural parts of Argentina and Chile, by comparison, I could only find empanadas, steak, sandwiches made with cheese and white bread, ice cream, fries, and hardly any vegetables.''For someone who is on the road almost all the time and in really small and rural towns, you often\xa0simply have to take what you can get.''Place: Beautiful. Food: VERY rich''Reaching my heaviest weight and making changes''It hit me when the jeans that were always too big for me were suddenly a struggle to zip up. I found myself getting depressed about it constantly. I didn’t want to look in the mirror and almost every time I saw a photo of myself, I hated the way it looked.''What do people think when they see me? Do they think I’m overweight? Will my friends at home notice? They all still look so good. Will I look like the whale of the group now?''Then I realized that if I didn’t change the way I saw myself I might not bounce back. I needed to confidently start working out and eating healthier. I had to get that self-love\xa0back and be my own cheerleader.''I also came to realize that pretty much everyone has issues with this. I don’t know anyone who looks in the mirror and really thinks perfection is staring back at them. There’s always some kind of struggle. Five more pounds, a more defined core, a smaller nose, the list goes on.''The most important thing is to love the positive things, and work on what is within my control, and that’s my own health and well-being.\xa0I want to be strong. I want to be healthy, and I want to be\xa0appreciative of what I do have instead of focusing on what I don’t have. I might not be exactly where I want to be right at this moment, but I’m on my way.

Regarded as the gateway for Mount Rinjani, Senaru is a hub for travellers eagerly awaiting their fate on Lombok’s highest mountain. With many disregarding the village as merely a transit stop, we decided to take a closer look around and see what it has to offer!''Admiring the view from the summit of Mount Rinjani, Lombok''Though we had\xa0completed the treacherous hike to the summit only the day before, we were desperate for somewhere to relax for several hours before we moved South – preferably at ground level as we didn’t think our feet could take much more!''As we tucked into our breakfast of banana chocolate pancakes, we got chatting to the locals who seemed to have permanently reserved a table at our guesthouse restaurant! Asking us of our plans, we told them we were heading off to explore. “Maybe you will like to see the waterfalls?” Our ears pricked up! Waterfalls? This was exactly what we needed.''They proceeded to show us a map on their phones with pictures of a popular waterfall visited by many who have scaled Rinjani (want to know how? Check out this guide on''trekking Rinjani''). Taking advantage of local knowledge and''being the adventurous souls that we are'', we were eager to find out if there were any hidden gems if we waded deeper into the jungle. One of the guys explained that there was a better waterfall, mainly visited by locals just past the popular tourist spot. We were in luck! As he started pouring out directions left, right and center, he explained that we would still enter the national park, but would veer right down a dirt path just before the popular waterfall. Trying to reiterate the directions and seeing our confusion, he offered to give us a lift! “It’s not too far” he assured us!''Best mode of transport in Lombok''We hopped onto the back of their scooters and made our way along Jl. Pariwisata, up the hill and through the village. I don’t know how we hadn’t spotted it before, but hand made signs had been knocked into the grass verge with arrows leading the way to the entrance of the national park which stood just off the road to the left.''The entry to the park costs just 10,000IDR, less than $1! But as with most areas that attract tourists, they also attract local touts trying to sell their “guide” services. We’d been warned of them by the guys from the guesthouse, who had told us that it was best to use one of the local guides but not at all necessary. As soon as we jumped off the bikes they approached us. Some were quite forceful in selling themselves, making the waterfall seem difficult to reach without their knowledge and expertise… We chose to go it alone, a decision we definitely didn’t regret!''Heading past the ticket office we followed the tour groups down the path down and through the jungle toward the well-known Sendang Gile waterfall. The water plummeted toward the river below, crashing against the rocks and we couldn’t wait to get under, although we did have to bide our time and wait for the tourists to get their shots … and we thought we were bad for taking photos!!''Sendang Gile Waterfall''But as the groups stood and marveled at the lone plume of water, we knew what lay ahead and not content with the one waterfall, we needed another fix. As everyone continued back to the ticket office, we spotted the dirt path on the left, which would take us to Tiu Kelep.''Venturing on we followed the path before reaching a bridge.''On the other side of the bridge, we walked by the waterway and past a yellow dam structure. We were met by two rivers that we needed to cross, the first slightly calmer than the second.''Keep going! Cross the second river and you’re almost there''After a few minutes, the colossal sound of the waterfall pounding the river below filled the mist-drenched air. Only a few boulders stood between our destination and us. Our hearts began racing as we clambered over the rocks, eager to catch our first glimpse.''As we set our eyes on the waterfall, we were transfixed, the cold spray creating rainbows on the surface of the water. The mighty Tiu Kelep. Senaru’s best kept secret. A plethora of waterfalls meeting at the end of their journey, it truly was magical. The freezing water nipped at our skin.''Its sheer force kept\xa0us at arms length as we laid back and gazed at the size of this natural phenomenon. Lush, green forests surrounded us as Rinjani peered over the rocks reminding us of our feat the day before.

In a place full of both luxury hotels and plenty of camping spots, opportunities to hitchhike or take expensive scenic flights, and with paid\xa0tours or do-it-yourself options for the adventurous, it’s possible to do Patagonia on all kinds of budgets.''I was more on the affordable but comfortable side of travel budgets in Patagonia, and spent a total of $3332 on approx. 60 days, coming out to\xa0≈ $55.53 per day.''Here’s how I did it and how you can do the same or even cheaper when traveling in Patagonia:''Argentina vs. Chile''In El Chaltén, Argentina''Patagonia is split between Argentina and Chile, and neither country is particularly cheap.''Chile has the best economy in South America''. It’s stable,\xa0easy to travel through with pretty decent infrastructure, and as a result, nowhere near as cheap as the countries to the North of it in South America, like Bolivia and Peru.''Argentina used to be a place where the black market meant tourists could get a lot more bang for their buck, but unfortunately due to recent changes,''you’re not rich anymore in Argentina''. I found it to be a pretty expensive country as far as food and accommodation, and especially gear.''Neither country is a super budget destination (but neither is uber expensive, either), and the more remote places get, the more expensive they also tend to be. Keep this in mind when planning out your Patagonia budget.''Accommodation in Patagonia''Home for the night: A tent under the stars in Argentina''This is where you can really save or splurge in Patagonia, because some places, like''Torres del Paine National Park in Chile'', have super luxury hotel options as well as camping options. Here’s the usual cost:''Camping:\xa0Just about everywhere you go, camping will be available. Chances are good that you’re in Patagonia because you plan on doing some''hiking and trekking'', so if you have a tent along with you, you’re looking at accommodation options with a kitchen and showers for $5-$20 per night''Private rooms in Guest Houses: If you elect not to camp, private rooms run from $20-$60 on the low end, and upwards of $500 per night on the high end. In most of the smaller towns, cheap private rooms will be the only type of available accommodation other than camping''Dorms:\xa0In the more popular areas of Patagonia like''Bariloche''and''El Chaltén'', you can also find dorms, which will run closer to $15 per night on average.''Transportation in Patagonia''At the end of the road after hitchhiking the Carretera Austral for 2 weeks''This is another area where you can really spend a lot or save considerably when traveling in Patagonia. There are three options for getting around and all have their perks:''Hitchhiking: This is a pretty common way to get around in Patagonia and is actually a common rite of passage for young Chileans along the more remote''Carretera Austral in Chile''. It’s free, but it also requires standing for hours with a thumb up and sometimes having no luck all day, plus it’s never without its risks. That said, this is the method I chose and I had some''incredible experiences''as a result.''Car rental: For those on a tight schedule, it sometimes makes sense to rent a car, especially if traveling along the Carretera Austral where busses are infrequent and hitchhiking takes a lot of time. Prepare to pay up if you plan on returning it at the end of the road instead of where you started the trip.''Buses: Most of the long-distance buses in South America have reclining seats and are nice and roomy. They are available in semi-cama (partially reclining) and full-cama (fully reclining) and can take you a full 30+ hours on some routes. They can run anywhere from $20 and up for longer distances and can be booked at your hostel, online (depending on the company) or directly at the bus station. On the Carretera Austral, they only go on certain days of the week.''Fly: Intra-country flights in Chile and Argentina can be pretty cheap, but as soon as you cross a border, they jump in price.''Hike: Most of the time it’s about getting to a destination and using it as a base for hikes, but sometimes, it’s a great way to get from point A to point B like at the end of the''Carretera Austral as one enters Argentina''.''Food Costs''Picking my own wild Calafate berries in Argentina for a snack''The food in most of Patagonia can get expensive in restaurants. Patagonia is also home to some of the best lamb and steak you can find worldwide, so it’s definitely worth splurging now and then on a meal out.''The best way to combat restaurant prices is to buy your own food at the local grocery stores and cook it yourself in the hostel or campground’s kitchen. This is common practice in South America and most hostels have kitchens and cooking utensils available for guest use.''When on the move, empanadas are a delicious and cheap way to fill your belly, as well as the menu del dia (menu of the day), which includes a starter, main, and dessert and are usually available around lunchtime.''Gear''one week’s worth of food and gear in Patagonia''Gear can get expensive if you wait to buy it in Chile or Argentina. I balked at the prices of backpacks and sleeping bags when in Argentina, finding that some things were exponentially more expensive than they would be back in the States or in Europe. If possible, bring as much as you can from home. Here’s a''packing list for clothing''and a guide for''camping and trekking''to help you out.''In a pinch, head to the Zona Franca (duty free) shopping mall in Punta Arenas at the south of Chile if you’re traveling\xa0from South to North. Otherwise,\xa0prepare to pay similar or higher prices than you would at home.''What I did''Thumbs up!''My Patagonia budget is based on a few flights, a lot of hitchhiking, a lot of private rooms, and a fair amount of camping when I was trekking, which was often. I also ate out regularly rather than cooking for myself, and rarely camped when in a town. I could have saved a lot more money by camping and cooking my own food, but decided to opt for more comforts instead.''Traveling in Patagonia doesn’t have to be expensive. Regardless of your budget and comfort requirements, by sleeping in a tent and participating in free activities like enjoying nature, it doesn’t have to set you back too much money.''Regardless of how you approach it, the best part of all is that the wine is delicious and cheap.

If you’re starting up there like I did, don’t miss this hike.\xa0The trail starts after a 2-ish hour bus ride from the nearby town of Bariloche, popular for skiing in the winter.''The beginning runs through a forest and is pretty easy until getting to a steep and winding portion called the caracoles. After that, the climb is mostly on rock and though long, the trek is not extremely difficult. There’s a refugio at the top where you can sleep for the night (book ahead in Bariloche at Club Andino!), or tote your own tent and camp. Watching the stars over the glacier is truly a spectacular sight. Read more about''Bariloche and the hike here''.''Refugio Frey''Loved these orange rocks''Difficulty:\xa0Medium''Length:\xa0One day''The time it takes to do this hike and the difficulty can really vary, since there are several ways to get to the Refugio Frey. You can take the ski lift up to the Condor lookout then boulder for a few hours, straight up then straight down, in order to reach the refugio, or you can take the forest path, or some combo of the two.''I love bouldering so I bouldered in and walked through the forest path back out, creating a loop. This hike is doable in one day but beware the steep and narrow path to the boulders for those who don’t like heights. It even had me shaking a bit and I don’t mind them at all!''Cerro Castillo''Villa Cerro Castillo’s famous hike (it’s why we stopped there)''Difficulty: Medium''Length: One day''This used to be a multi-day trek from just outside of Coyhaique along the Carretera Austral, but these days they’ve opened up the ’emergency route’ from the town of Villa Cerro Castillo that sits just at the base, and allow hikers to go up the steep trail that takes only one day.''The Cerro Castillo, with its aqua-blue glacial lake and black rocks covered in white glacial ice would be a treat in and of itself, but the views in every direction of the painted mountains\xa0and canyons that lead to and away from Villa Cerro Castillo are absolutely stunning as well.''If you find yourself here,''meet a gaucho and go on the hike''. It’s an excellent way to spend a day.''Exploradores Glacier''Too cool to miss''Difficulty: Medium''Length:\xa0Depends – full day of trekking for at least 8 hours''Part of what makes Patagonia exciting is how recently certain parts of it have been made accessible. It wasn’t even until the late ’80s that one could drive all the way down the''Carretera Austral'', the mostly gravel road that runs through Chilean Patagonia. Towards the end of it, you’ll find Puerto Rio Tranquilo,\xa0the gateway to the Exploradores Glacier.''A local there who runs the tours told me that he only became aware of the glacier over the past five years, and that tours on it have only been going for the last couple.

Overnight there then get ready to hoof it for 22km into Argentina through no-man’s land.''Once you cross into Argentina, you have the choice to take a boat or to walk an additional 15km to where busses (or cars, if you fancy hitchhiking), can take you into the town of\xa0El Chaltén.

Use a gentle exfoliator\xa0 (I use''Origin’s Modern Friction)''and then apply a generous amount of your favorite moisturizer right before bed. You’ll awake to hydrated, makeup-ready skin. It also saves you an extra 10-15 minutes in the morning – which for us travelers means extra exploring time.''Switch to Face Oil''Ditch the facial creams and opt for rich face oils in the fall and winter months. \xa0They tend to lock in moisture and the right products are loaded with plant proteins and vitamins which not only create the appearance of healthy skin, but actually work to protect skin against damage-causing free radicals and environmental toxins.''I use (and swear by) Flora Hydroactive Facial Oil by Sunday Riley – it absolutely transformed my stubbornly dry and dull skin to bright and beaming. I couldn’t imagine my skin before this product and will definitely be diving into more of products from the Sunday Riley line.''Choose Lightweight Coverage''This is a year-round trick but especially critical in colder weather: give your skin some breathing room.

Summer tans will fade and it’s important to stick to stunning shades of blush and lipstick to ensure your look is cohesive and vibrant.''During fall and winter, I don’t dare stray from Bobbi Brown products. They are rich, creamy and endless in the most autumnally on-point shades. My favorite lipstick shade is''Slopes by Bobbi Brown''and I am also a huge fan of the cream''Pot Rouge blush in Calypso Coral''– which also doubles as a lipstick.''Stick to Liquid''If you have powder-based products in your makeup line, ditch them during fall and winter.

In this post, she explains Cambodian cuisine and shares a recipe of one of her favorite Cambodian dishes.''Growing up in Southern California, I was always surrounded by the food of different cultures. The best carne asada came from the Spanish-speaking market, where I stretched my high-school vocabulary to the max.''Una libra de carne asada por favor.''Twenty minutes north, pho houses and Vietnamese bakery-coffee shops dotted every corner. Sushi bars, teppanyaki grills, dim sum, Korean BBQ, and Thai takeout were mainstays of my dining experience from a young age.''But one cuisine was conspicuously absent, despite the abundance of south Asian dining options in every strip mall in my suburban homeland: Cambodian food.''So when I hopped off the plane in Siem Reap, fresh off a month of stuffing my face with all my favorite Thai curries, I had zero idea what to expect. My (limited) research told me that Cambodian food didn’t pack the punch of its culinary heavyweight neighbors on either side, so expectations were low.''Perhaps that’s why I was so wowed.''Here’s a tip: Do''NOT''believe any guidebook or blog that says Cambodian food leaves little to be desired. Sure, it may not have the chili obsession of southern Thailand or the wildly popular soups and sandwiches of Vietnam, but Cambodia offers its own unique blend of flavors that deserves reverence.''Most Cambodian cuisine is national — you will find similar menus in Siem Reap and Phnom Penh. However, each area will prepare these dishes slightly differently, and each restaurant has its own unique approach to these recipes. There is one region of Cambodia that has a proud place in the global culinary scene, and any foodie worth his or her salt should visit.''Culinary Capital: Kampot & Kep''The French colonial influence is felt more strongly in these southeastern cities than the rest of Cambodia, through both the architecture, the makeup of the tourists, the the food. The rural farmland surrounding these two outposts is considered home to the highest-quality version of the most essential of seasonings: pepper. The humble peppercorn is elevated to new heights in the wide flatlands of the Kampot countryside, where it comes in pink, green, white, and black. It is revered by top chefs all over the world, and Kampot locals are fiercely proud of the plantations that dot the countryside.''And if you’re thinking to yourself:''Pepper is just pepper. What the heck?''No, this pepper is kissed by the gods. I swear it has a little extra spiciness, a little kick in the palate that makes your entire mouth sit up and listen to what the dish is saying to you. The fanciest French restaurants would only use Kampot pepper, and traditional''steak au poivre''required this exotic spice when Cambodia was a French colony. This pepper was the one thing I brought back from Cambodia with me, after being toted for six more months, and it was gone in less than three.''A display of the goods at a Kampot pepper plantation''Mosey a little further east to Kep, a seaside town famous for its crab, and suddenly a match in culinary heaven is born: Pepper Crab.''Pepper crab is made in Kep using green peppercorns, which are immature, unripened peppercorns that can’t be found outside of Cambodia because they dry out and the flavor changes after just a couple of days. Pepper crab consists of freshly-caught crab fried in a delicious garlicky-chili sauce that’s heavy on (you guessed it) pepper! One bite and the sweetness of the crab meat, the warmth of the chili and the''kapow!''kick of pepper will send your tatebuds to seafood heaven. Also worth trying in Kep are the myriad prawn dishes, served with yummy curries and lots of that famous Kampot pepper. Yum!''Delicious Kampot Pepper Crab''(Photo:''Kampot Pepper Crab''/Black Palm/''CC-BY-SA-3.0'')''Where to sample: Lonely Planet has made''Kimly’s''the most famous crab shack in Crab Shack Row, but some people complain that the quality has gone downhill and the sauce is too heavy.''Diamond Jasmine''and''So Kheang Restaurant''have gotten good marks from expats.''The most authentic way to try Kep crab? At the''Crab Market''itself! Haggle with Khmer saleswomen over the price and size of the crabs, which vary each day. Once you’ve purchased your crab, pay to get it boiled or fried onsite. After it’s cooked, purchase chili sauce and rice from kiosks in the market and sit down for a meal right there! Talk about fresh. It’s a crab-lover’s heaven.''Dishes Not to Miss''Outside of Kep, there are plenty of dishes worth sampling while you’re in Cambodia. Here’s a shortlist of the ones you''absolutely''must try.''Fish Amok''A pretty package: Fish Amok''Often called the national dish of Cambodia, fish amok is a pretty little parcel of fish and thick yellow sauce in a banana leaf package. The sauce is a wondrous mixture of intense Asian flavors: several different types of ginger give it a hint of sweet spice, lemongrass and kaffir lime lend a jolt of tartness, and coconut milk gives it a creamy thickness that will coat your tastebuds in this heavenly mixture. Many restaurants offer this dish with chicken for fish-leery Westerners, but it tastes best with the most common Khmer protein: white fish.''Where to Try:''For Life Restaurant''in Siem Reap,''Nary’s Kitchen''in Battambang,''Romdeng''in Phnom Penh (Romdeng is also a social enterprise for disadvantaged youth. Win-win!)''Beef Lok Lak''Where the fish is a light explosion of flavor, beef lok lak is a savory roundhouse kick to the mouth. The star of this dish is undoubtedly the beef, stir-fried in a thick brown sauce that’s the warm blanket of beef sauces. It’s served with a tangy lime-pepper dipping sauce that’s the perfect foil to the uber-savory beef. This was one of my favorite dishes in Cambodia, and one I recreated for friends and family at home with yummy success. Recipe is below if you want to try it too!''Where to Try: It’s hard to find a restaurant that can mess this dish up, but here are a few suggestions:''Jack’s Place''or''Veronica’s Kitchen''in Kampot,''Genevieve’s''in Siem Reap,''Karma Restaurant''in Phnom Penh.''Khmer Noodles''The noodles, ready to be piled high with yumminess''To get the most authentic version of this dish, seek out the women with buckets and pots dangling from a pole balanced over their shoulders. Those buckets contain the individual components of this dish: thin rice noodles, fresh veggies like cucumber, green beans, and bean sprouts, herbs like mint and basil, and a lemongrass green curry sauce to pour over the whole thing. When you order, the woman will put down the pole and make you a dish right there on the roadside. It’s a common breakfast meal in Cambodia, so look for it at morning markets.''Where to Try: Near the''Central Market''in Phnom Penh or the''Old Market''in Siem Reap.''BBQ Pork and Rice: a.k.a.''bai sach chrouk''Because this is Cambodia’s most popular breakfast, it’s tragically hard to find this dish after mid-morning. Tragic because this would be a''delicious''lunch and/or dinner as well! Sweet, caramelized BBQ pork is smothered in a garlicky-soy sauce, grilled over smoky charcoal, then sliced thin over rice and served with pickled veggies on the side. You might think savory when you look at it, but there is a sweetness in this marinade that makes it great for breakfast… think Asian-style maple bacon. You will do a happy dance after one bite of this simple-but-delicious meal.''Where to Try: Everywhere you go! I personally think street carts and market stalls are best for this one (especially the''morning markets''in Battambang or the''local market''[''not''Old Market] in Siem Reap), but''Restaurant 126''in Phnom Penh gets packed with locals and sells out before 8 a.m., so it must be something special!''Cambodian Curry''Cambodian Red Curry (UpSticksNGo/''CC-BY-SA-3.0'')''There are two common types of curry in Cambodia, red and green. The red curry is more common than the green, but you can find both on most restaurant menus these days. Where Thai curries are heavy on the chili, Cambodian curry dials up the sweet factor. Still heavy on vegetables and aromatics like ginger, galangal, turmeric, and lemongrass, there’s also sweet potato, a strong dose of coconut milk, and a dash of sugar that makes it uniquely Khmer.''Where to Try:''The Corn''in Phnom Penh does a good vegetarian version (you can get meat also!),''Khmer Kitchen''in Siem Reap has a traditional and simple version, and''Rikitikitavi''in Kampot does good Khmer''and''Western food, so you can finish your curry with a ridonkulous brownie dessert (like I did) or slice of pie.''Beverages''Cambodia is home to a few unique drink options that are worth a sample (and sometimes''only''a sample). Here they are:''Rice Wine''A mountain of rice, ready to be brewed into… wine?''Or as I call it: Cambodian Moonshine. The word wine''seriously''misrepresents this beverage!''Here’s what it tasted like to me: Imagine the cheapest bottle of vodka you could finagle from the liquor store in high school. The one that was below the bottom shelf, cost $5, and was probably expired. Now toss that into a washing machine with a tablespoon of sugar and a load of dirty socks and put it on spin.''One small sip of this concoction screamed down my throat like a power-fart from Satan and enlarged my sinuses until an elephant could take a casual stroll through them.''When you try it, the Khmer will watch you sip with laughing eyes, waiting for the tears to form in your own. Then they will drink it like it’s no big thang, like your entire skull doesn’t get violently assaulted by this innocuous-looking clear liquid. Despite the trauma, it’s a must-try if you visit Cambodia, if only to say you drank it.''Angkor Beer''This is the cheapest and most prevalent beer option in Cambodia, and good luck getting out of Pub Street in Siem Reap without having at least a few of these! It’s a pretty basic lager (no craft brew flavor here), but it’s light enough to have several and tasty enough to get through before it gets warm. In the humid nights of Cambodia, that’s saying a lot!''Sugar Cane Juice''For a non-alcoholic option, look for wheeled carts on the streets of Cambodia’s cities and towns with a mechanical press and several stalks of sugarcane. The drink is simply a fresh stalk of sugarcane, juiced through a hand-cranked press into a plastic bag with ice and a straw. You drink a sweet, delicate, cold drink immediately after it’s pressed, and in the humidity and heat of Cambodia it is''heaven''. I have no idea what the calories on these are, but it feels a little more honest than a Coca Cola. Sorry Coke lovers!''Read Next: A Full Cambodia Guide''Bring Cambodia to Your Kitchen''Not traveling to Cambodia anytime soon? Bring these flavors to you!

Pour into a bowl to serve with the meat.''Optional: Fry an egg until cooked to medium, and place on top of each serving of beef. Garnish each serving with 2 leaves of lettuce, a 2 -3 slices of tomato, and 1 slice of onion.''Beef Lok Lak is typically eaten by spearing a chunk of meat, egg, and vegetable onto your fork, dipping in the sauce, and shoveling the whole mess into your mouth. It’s usually served with steamed rice.''If you make at home, I suggest steamed rice and a salad with Asian-style dressing to accompany the meat.''Cooked and ready to eat. Yum!''*You can sub Sriracha for all or part of the chili sauce in this dish. If you opt for 100% sriracha, it will be''spicy''.

No problem, because there’s still a way to see the highlights even in limited time.''I traveled through Patagonia from February through March of this year and took it slowly, trying to explore as much of the region as possible while working simultaneously. Some people I met had even longer in Patagonia than I did, but most were on shorter trips and had to pick and choose what they saw.''That got me thinking about what I would have prioritized had I been working with less time, and with that in mind, I put together three different Patagonia itineraries for those with one week, two weeks, or one month to travel with.''(Note: If you have more time and\xa0want to retrace my journey,''start with the archives''or''Bariloche in the Argentina guide''and follow the chronological blog posts, all of which have directions and advice.)''This information is for those who want to self-guide their own tour of Patagonia, since I’m all about independent travel and take tours only when they offer a glimpse into something I can’t access or understand as well on my own.''As Patagonia is all about the outdoors, these itineraries prioritize hiking and camping, two must-dos in Patagonia.

Therefore on resort islands, you’re more likely to meet people from all over the world working there.''Also: Overwater bungalows''The resort islands also have those iconic overwater bungalows, which are generally missing from the local islands.''Though I didn’t stay in one, they sure do make for good photos.''amiright?''Bungalows at night''My room, which had an outdoor shower/bathroom and opened right onto the water''Another thing I loved about\xa0staying on Ellaidhoo\xa0was that I could take scuba gear or snorkeling equipment out anytime I wanted to go diving or swimming along the house reef, which was a really impressive reef with tons of fish.''Anywhere that offers me unlimited diving is a huge value in my book.''How I wish I was a fish''My first day out, within the first minute, I saw a reef shark.''True to what I have seen the last time I was there, I saw schools of fish, beautiful corals, and had even heard that some divers saw a whale shark one of the mornings there. I was bummed to have missed that but it just goes to show you can spot some seriously impressive underwater animals in the Maldives.''R&R''I wondered if I’d miss the local experience I had the previous time, and while I did love the chance to immerse myself in Maldivian culture, I also fully immersed myself in the resort culture, too.''That’s a serious rarity for me but in the Maldives, it was perfect.''Too perfect''On the local island I drank a lot of sweetened iced coffee, on the resort island, I had an all-inclusive wristband and went for beer.''Is it shameful to admit that I prefer the latter?''I also did really like being able to hang out in my bikini in the pool or in the water all day.''The two experiences were so different, to prefer one over the other would be like comparing passion fruit and summer cherries. They both belong in my life and omigod please don’t make me choose!''I loved them both, and I love that both are affordable\xa0(full disclosure, I didn’t pay for this second trip but rooms at the Cinnamon Ellaidhoo can be a great deal, particularly in the off season. You can find the room rates''here'').''Something I can definitively say when comparing the two is that in\xa0both places I really felt welcomed. The locals on the local Island were kind, and the staff at the resort were also incredibly catering and attentive.''I left feeling like both ways, perhaps during the same trip, are the perfect way to experience the Maldives.''*This post was brought to you in collaboration with''Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts''.

Are you in search of that humbling feeling that overcomes you as you stand and marvel at the giant Moai statues, towering above us mere mortals?\xa0When I went there in April of this year, that’s most certainly what I was after.''It really is as\xa0incredible\xa0as I always thought it would be to see the Moai in person. Though nobody knows the story entirely, since almost no original descendants of the Rapa Nui people are left, the story of the Moai is one of incredible human ingenuity and suffering and it’s a profound experience to walk among them and wonder about their stories.''Ready for a walk into the past? Here are the secrets for traveling to Easter Island cheaply and easily:''First, a little history''On Easter Island, locally called Rapa Nui, the Moai statues represent a mostly-lost civilization\xa0that suffered from some sort of''climate change or vermin'', causing them to run out of resources. In an effort to appease their ancestors in hopes of returning to prosperity, they carved giant Moai out of volcanic rock and somehow carried them to the edges of the island, all without the benefit of knowing how to work metal. We still don’t know how they did it. The largest one around today is an astounding 33 feet tall''weighing over 82 tons''!''In time as the situation grew more desperate, the people lost faith in these statues and battles ensued, including toppling over the Moai of rival groups. Most have been raised and put back in place but some are still laying facedown\xa0in the grass.''Moai at the quarry''You can still see the quarry where several statues are partially finished on the island. It almost looks like the Moai decided to have a party and some drunkenly stumbled down the mountain on their way to the sea.''These days, the relics remain on an island where almost all of the original inhabitants have gone extinct, including the trees, animals, and original\xa0ethnic groups. It’s creepy and beautiful at the same time.''How to plan independently and save money''Tours to Easter Island aren’t necessary, and will cost you way more in the long run. It’s almost impossible to get lost, and even if you did, the island is only 164 square kilometers so you can’t go too far astray!''Here’s how to do it on your own:''Flights:''There’s only one plane from one airline that goes to and flies back from Rapa Nui daily and it’s operated by LAN departing out of Santiago, Chile. I suggest playing around with different dates on''Google Flights''then booking directly with LAN once you find a good deal. I booked my flight just two weeks before getting on the plane for $600, flying economy one way and business class back!\xa0Typically, a round-trip flight will cost $450 on the very low end and closer to $700 on the high end.''Food:''Your biggest cost-saver will be bringing your own food to Easter Island. Almost all of the food on the island will be brought over on the very plane you fly\xa0over on, so why pay a premium when you can just bring your food yourself for way less?''LAN allows you to check up to 25 kilos per person for free when flying to Easter Island, so get an extra bag or box and fill it up with veggies, dry goods, powdered milk, oatmeal, potatoes, wine, and anything else to help you get through the week. By planning out my recipes ahead of time and shopping in Santiago I was able to eat for an average of $4.50 per meal, plus wine.''When I did need to supplement my meals, I bought fish from the local fishermen for around $8 per person or bought empanadas at the small shops around town.''*Note: You can only do this if you bring the food from within Chile. There are super strict laws in Chile around fruits and vegetables and anything you bring from home will not be allowed in, so be sure to do your shopping in Santiago.''Just a short walk away from my cabana in Hanga Roa''Accommodation:''You can also save a bunch of money by staying in a cabana owned by a local on the island. They’re easy to find on booking.com (''here’s the one I suggest'') and''Airbnb''(plus, here’s $35 off for you!), can often accommodate six or seven people for around $50+ per night, and most importantly, they come with a kitchen so that you can cook all that food you brought along with you.''It’s also common practice for the cabana owners to come and pick you up from the airport, which is always nice after a long flight.''If you’re traveling solo, there are also hostels and individual rooms on''Airbnb'', and camping is also an option. Just keep in mind that the cheap stuff books out much farther in advance.''Getting around:''You really don’t need to take a tour to explore Easter Island. There are plenty of car, scooter, and quad rental places in Hanga Roa (the main town) that you can make use of to take yourself around to the various statues and the beach, on your own time, and in many cases, without other tourists around.\xa0Unlike those on bus tours, you’ll be able to spend as long as you want at the various sites.''By normal standards, the rentals are pretty expensive at $40 per day for a motorbike and upwards for quad bikes and cars. That said, you can usually haggle on the car rentals and if you really maximize your time with the motorbike, you can see most of the things that are far away from town in a couple of days and rely on a cheaper push bike rental for the rest of your time there.''Ask at the people working at the rental place that you end up choosing to show you where the sites are on a map. In lieu of that,''check this one out''.''No tour needed and nobody else was there!''National Park Tickets:''The fees for the national park are steep for foreigners at the equivalent of $60 USD, imposed by CONAF, Chile’s national park services (though there has been''some conflict''over whether they should have the right to do so, that’s the policy for now).''You will only be checked by rangers at two of the sites: the Orongo crater at the Bird Man museum, which I could have lived without, and at the quarry. The quarry is probably the coolest site on the whole island, so as painful as it is, I’d suggest that you cough it up and buy the ticket. You can buy it when you land or at the CONAF office.''Here’s how to avoid the crowds''There are specific times when tours stop at each of the archaeological sites in order to get them with their best lighting. It’s still a good idea to visit them at those times as well, but also to stop by again during the off times and to stick around after the busses leave. They’re usually there for 10 minutes, max.''Ahu Akivi''Nobody there. Score!''These seven identical statues face sunset during the spring equinox, and their most popular visitation time is during golden hour. when the light shines on them. get there slightly before or stay after, and the busses will mostly be gone.''Ahu Tongariki''Ahu Tongariki in the mid-afternoon. Nobody was there!''This is the biggest collection of Moai and also features the largest statue\xa0on the island. All were toppled over in the past but have been re-erected. During the summer solstice they face the sunset, but the most popular time to see them is for the sunrise since the sun rises between them. If you visit at any other time, almost nobody will be around.''Rano Raraku''This is the quarry''It’s popular to visit\xa0Rano Raraku, the quarry I keep referencing, right after visiting the Ahu Tongariki in the morning. It’s when they are in their best light. That said, I visited them in the afternoon and enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere. This is one of two places where you’ll have to show a receipt for your national park fees, and you’re only allowed in once.''Ranu Kau volcano and Orongo''It’s massive''This volcano crater is one of the most famous on the island and you can drive your motorbike right up to it. The best time to visit is when it’s sunny so that you can see the blue sky reflected in the pools of water at the base. It’s also possible to hike up to it from the CONAF station.''There’s also the ruins of Orongo and the story of the bird man inside the museum, which also requires that you should your receipt for the national park fees. It’s an interesting story worth reading about.''Only visible from the museum''Ahu Tahai''A surfer comes in for the night''Located just next to Hanga Roa, these are the easiest to visit as you can just head over on foot if you’re staying in town. Though beautiful all day, they draw a crowd at sunset.''There are plenty of other statues all along the perimeter of the island. some you can drive to and some you can only get to on foot. The above are the most famous, but you can visit the others, often without anyone around, as you drive along the island and pull off periodically to explore.''What else can you do on Easter Island?''What if you have a few days on Easter Island? I actually had a full eight days there, mostly because the flights got really expensive for any shorter length of time. I did a lot of relaxing, but otherwise, enjoyed the beach and diving as well:''SCUBA Dive''Oh hey, sunken Moai''The reefs off of the island are nice, but not world-class like they are in''Indonesia''or''Borneo''. You can, however, get your selfie with this guy.''It’s actually an old movie prop, which did make it less cool for me, but still an experience nonetheless.''Surf''Those who remember the documentary,''180° South'', will recall that surfing is a big sport on Easter Island.''If you want to give it a try, keep in mind that the coastline is mostly volcanic rock, and the waves break very close to them, so this isn’t ideal for beginners. You’ll also want to bring your own board as rentals are usually just the huge foam boards.''Beach''Easter Island’s one and only beach''Easter Island’s beach is really nice, with white sand and gentle waves. It’s on the opposite side of the island from Hanga Roa, where most visitors stay, so you’ll need transport to get there somehow.''If you’re on the island for a while, though, this is a great way to spend a whole day.''Pin me!''Those are my best tips on how to travel to Easter island independently.

It may not seem super stylish at first, but it’s one of the best, and most comfortable,\xa0opportunities to define your own unique fashion statement.''I’ve met several travelers who are surprised by this – they are under the impression that only heels and overly complicated gladiator sandals are the only way to be considered fashionable and Instagram-ready.''Here is my secret: Style has nothing to do with fashion and it isn’t a race. It’s all about allowing''your''vibrant personality to pour into your wardrobe choices – it doesn’t have to cost a fortune, it certainly doesn’t have to be designer, and you can choose chic without sacrificing comfort.''So what’s the best walking shoe to have in your suitcase this year for fashion-savvy travelers? Ditch the same shoes you run in and opt for a pair of''all-white Adidas''or''similar sneaker of choice''. It goes with everything, is comfortable to the extreme and instantly brings your look from basic to the same street style supermodels in Paris wear off-duty.''Work Sneakers with Shorts or a Skirt''Pair with a pair of white high-waist shorts and crop top – can’t go wrong!''They go with both skirts and shorts – rejoice!

From maxi dresses, silky nighttime cocktail dresses to more Roman Holiday style pieces like I’m wearing above (one of my favorite steals from Zara this season), you can combine the comfort of walking shoes without sacrificing your Audrey Hepburn vibes.''Rock them with Pants or Jeans''The best part of white sneakers: they go with every pair of pants and jeans in your wardrobe, unexceptionally.''Some destinations and climates obviously don’t allow miniskirts, shorts or flowy dresses. Plus with autumn quickly approaching, we travelers should be filling our suitcases with more pants and jeans.

It seemed the best option to really get to know the desert was to go camping there.''I couldn’t find any kind of itinerary or help on the web prior to planning my trip,\xa0so I figured that I’d make the resource!\xa0Here’s everything you need to know about where to go and how to get ready for camping in the San Pedro de Atacama Desert:''First: The Vehicle''my wicked camper van''The best way to get around is in some kind of camper van or 4×4 car with a roof tent, or a pickup truck that you can stash your own tent in (I don’t believe there are tent rentals available in San Pedro). I chose a''Wicked camper van''because\xa0it offered me everything I didn’t have already: Wheels, cooking equipment, a place to sleep, and comfort in the cold desert.''If you go this route, double check everything when you pick up the van, particularly that everything you need is there in case you get a flat tire. My van was missing a few things\xa0and I’m so glad that the friend I was renting with and I checked first. Once I was on the road, I didn’t have any problems at all.''*Note that almost all of the vehicles will be manual rather than automatic.''Costs''A camper van or rental is not a super budget option. However, a rental''can''be as cheap as a mid-range private room and tours would be, especially if you opt for a larger car and share it with several people. Wicked’s 3-person rental would be really cramped with three people, though, so just keep in mind that the more people who join the group, the less sleeping space you’ll have.\xa0Buy and cook your own food instead of eating in town and that will help as well.''Each of the natural areas has an entrance fee. They can run anywhere from 2000 to 15000 Pesos per person. Whether you’re on a tour or independent, you’ll have to pay these.''It’s also always wise to have''travel insurance.''It’s the desert, after all.''Where do you camp?''You can camp pretty close to here!''In the San Pedro de Atacama desert, most people free camp. In a lot of places I’ve visited that’s not allowed but out there in the desert, it’s totally fine.''The park entrance at the Valle de la Luna allows campers (more on that below), and there are plenty of places where you can simply follow car tracks off the road and find a nice, totally secluded spot for the night. It’s how I found some amazing sunset spots.''A word of caution: Sometimes the ground is soft and it’s easy to get stuck, so only pull off if it’s clearly safe to do so and you can see that the land has been flattened and/or there are clear tire tracks.''Does it get cold?''Stay warm, folks!''It’s hot during the day but pretty cold at night out there. Sometimes the camper van companies offer\xa0blankets, and sometimes they don’t. Luckily, there are tons of Alpaca products all over the region and blankets always make a nice gift, so if you have to buy some, you can.\xa0It’s wise to bring a hat and gloves as well, as the desert gets really cold at night.''Stock up on plenty of water in town before you go, since you can’t exactly refill easily in the driest desert on earth. I also suggest plotting your points as labeled GPS coordinates in an offline map, like maps.me, as cell signal can also be hard to come by out there.''Home Base: San Pedro''This little town looks like it’s straight out of an old western movie, and it’s the only place in the vicinity where you can fill up your gas tank, so keep that in mind when out exploring.''Chances are good that you’ll fly into Calama, the nearest airport, or bus into this town and spend at least your first night here before heading out on your camping trip. It’s a good place to stock\xa0up on groceries and get acclimated to the altitude. Since your camper van has a sink, cooler box, and stove, I suggest buying enough food for at least two days at a time each time you pass back through the town to fill up your gas tank.''The town did have some redeeming qualities, but you’re better off getting\xa0out and exploring as soon as you can. It’s better out there!''Find all ranges of accommodation in town here.''Valle de la Luna''Named after the moon, and I can see why!''Wind and water have carved the Valle de la Luna, or moon valley, into jagged peaks and valleys all throughout the park. There are giant sand dunes all around as well, and a very salty ground that somehow looks like snow even in the driest desert on earth.''This is THE place to watch the sunset. There are plenty of tours running through, but by being able to go when you want to, you can catch the whole sunset without having to worry about making it back to your bus. That’s priceless.''Lagunas Altiplanicas (inc. Laguna Miscanti and Miñiques)''Hey there, Guanaco!''Laguna Miscanti is a heart-shaped, dark blue lake that sits above 4000 meters. If you’re trying to level up in altitude, this is at a lower elevation than much of the other attractions, believe it or not, so it’s a good spot for your second day.''The drive out from San Pedro takes several hours along mostly-uninhabited desert with a few settlements here and there. The grasses that grow all along the way glow a bright yellow and though it sounds desolate, it’s absolutely gorgeous to watch as the landscape changes.''Piedras Rojas''by Diego Delso, used under creative commons''If you turn towards Aguas Calientes after visiting the lakes, you’ll see a famous site called Piedras Rojas.''Unfortunately, I didn’t have the\xa0intel before I went and had no idea this was there until I came back to town towards the end of my trip and started looking at the advertisements in the tourist agencies. It looks amazing and it’s nearby. Please don’t make the same mistake that I did! Go there!''Laguna Chaxa''Golden hour at Laguna Chaxa''For sunset in the area, you can’t beat Laguna Chaxa in the salt flats. This is where the flamingoes come to perform their nightly ritual of feeding in one lake and flying over to the other as it gets dark. It’s quite a display.''This is actually a series of a few lakes with a lovely trail running through the salty, jagged soil. It’s surprisingly soft and with the sunset colors, a real treat.''You can camp pretty close to here!''I was able to find a place to camp right at the turnoff for the lake where some trucks had been moving the earth around. The milky way that night was the clearest and most magnificent I’ve ever seen.''The milky way over a salt pan in the San Pedro de Atacama Desert''There are a few other lakes over there such as the Laguna Cejar, which you can swim in. It’s so salty, you’ll float just like the dead sea. The entrance is the equivalent of $20 US, however, so I decided to bypass that for something that sounded more relaxing, the hot springs.''Termas Banos de Puritama''The Puritama hot springs are expensive as well, at 15,000 CLP (USD $25). If you go\xa0after 2pm, the fee drops by half, but the wind will be stronger than it would be in the morning.''The baths aren’t scalding hot, but rather lukewarm, and as you move farther from the top/the source, they cool off more and more.''Still, if you’ve been in a camper van, it’s a nice hippie shower and the pampas grass growing all along the pools is so mystical and lovely.''Geysers del Tatio''Most people take a tour up to the geysers for sunrise, when they’re the most active.''I headed up just after sunrise and missed the crowds, while also enjoying the animal sightings along the way. The geysers are still bubbling after the sun rises, and at 4,200 meters in altitude, it’s really darn cold up there while it’s still dark.''Bonus, there are also hot springs at the geysers, and if you can brave the cold long enough to change and jump in (and more devastatingly, back out again all wet), the pool isn’t very crowded and the water is much hotter than at the Puritama hot springs.''On the drive back to town from the Geyers''*Note: If you drive a normal, non 4×4 car from the hot springs to the geysers, you cannot stay on the same road. You’ll need to go back to the fork in the road and turn right towards the geysers.''Valle del Arcoiris''Go for a hike here''The Rainbow valley (in English) isn’t very high on the tourist radar, so it’s easy to get this all to yourself and it’s not too far from the town of San Pedro, either.''There are a few dirt roads running through the valley, which has red, black, white, and green mountains running all through it.''If you do see a tour car there, I suggest following them to see what they’re checking out. You can find plenty of rewards by climbing through the rocks and caves!''Sunset at Valle de la Luna''There are two ways to see the Valle de la Luna. The method mentioned earlier in the post, and this one, which is just off of the main road before you get back into town. There’s no entrance fee and all you need to do is pull off to the shoulder\xa0to catch the sunset. This was night four of my four-day camper van rental and, though with more time and a 4×4 there was definitely more to see, this was a great sampling of the San Pedro de Atacama desert, a place I can’t imagine experiencing any way other than by camping.''The roads have hardly any other cars, the landscape is beautiful and it’s a definite advantage to be able to pull off whenever you want and to have the solitude under those stars that camping affords you.''The map below has all of the points plotted out on it. As I mentioned before, it’s best to plot these by coordinates then save on an offline map since signal isn’t always available out there:''Happy camping!''*This post was brought to you in collaboration with Wicked South America.

These are sweet, caramelized pieces of thin-cut pork that just melt in your mouth. It’s a Filipino version of cured bacon, with the flavor coating each each piece of meat in a sticky, gooey mess of happiness. Also served with fried eggs and garlic fried rice, this cured meat tastes just as delicious as all the hours that went into preparing it.''Midday Meal''Filipino Pizza''Disclaimer: This is''not''a typical Filipino dish. When I was trekking the rice terraces in Batad, I finished the day at a small cafe that overlooked the incredible hills I had just hiked. Out of curiosity, I ordered a Filipino pizza. When it arrived at my table, I was skeptical. It had''green beans''on it. The tomato sauce looked more like mild chili sauce. Sure, there was cheese, but it wasn’t the melty, gooey mess that usually comes with pizza. But then I took a bite… and it was strangely delicious. Somehow all those flavors combined to give me the perfect post-hike refresh, and I’d order another in a second.''Bizarre but delicious''Crispy Pata''Photo Credit with Permission: Kawaling Pinoy''Four words: Deep. Fried. Pork. Knuckle.''The outside is a crispy layer of crackling that might make you cry tears of joy when you break the crust (Just me? Maybe I''am''too into food). The inside: Juicy, falling-off-the-bone pork that will wrap your tastebuds in a warm hug that you hope never ends. It’s served with soy-vinegar dip that has the perfect amount of tang to cut through all that buttery goodness. Unless you don’t eat pork, there is no way you''can’t''enjoy''this simple and hearty meal. Please,''please''do not visit the Philippines without trying this!''Chicken Arroz Caldo''Photo: Arroz Caldo/Kawaling Pinoy''This is the Filipino equivalent of chicken noodle soup, a savory dish with bone-in chicken, a little kick of ginger, and a perfect sweet-citrus note of calamansi* as an aftertaste. Instead of noodles, rice is added, which thickens the overall texture into something closer to a porridge, depending on where you get this. If you catch the sniffles while traveling, the garlic and ginger in arroz caldo will fix you right up, so ask for extra!''*Calamansi is a popular citrus fruit in the Philippines that is a hybrid of a mandarin orange and kumquat. The flavor is like a sweet lime or a sour orange.''Snack''Chicharon''I was traveling on a bus from Cebu City to Oslob to swim with the whale sharks when I was befriended by a student named Vitex who was traveling to his family for the weekend. At one of the many stops between the point A and point B, a vendor hopped onto the bus to sell snacks. A few words of rapid-fire Tagalog later, I had a bag of''chicharon''in my hands, courtesy of Vitex. These are''not''the puffy, processed pork rinds of American gas stations that resemble a rice cracker more than they do meat. These are the real deal: pork skin boiled, seasoned overnight, then deep fried. Snack heaven! Thank you, Vitex.''Ukoy''Photo: Ukoy na Togue/Kawaling Pinoy''Who doesn’t love a fritter? And who''couldn’t''love a fritter made from a combo of shrimp and potato? Though potato or sweet potato is the most common second ingredient in these little parcels of crunchy goodness, almost any root vegetable can be combined with bean sprouts to make the ‘nest’ that the shrimp snuggles into. The result? The perfect handheld snack to hold you over until dinner.''Lumpia''Photo Credit with Permission: Kawaling Pinoy''Lumpia is a small word that describes a great many things. These are Filipino spring rolls, but they definitely aren’t the same as the ones you’ll find in mainland Southeast Asia. They look the same from the outside, but these can be filled with savory meats and fresh veggies''or''sugary bananas for dessert. The consistent factor? They are wrapped in a rice paper a fried to perfection. Look for the sweet version of these on street carts all over the islands.''Time for Dinner''Kare Kare''Photo: Kare Kare/Kawaling Pinoy''A dominant rule in Filipino cooking? Nothing goes to waste. In this case, it’s oxtail slow-cooked into a hearty stew. While this one isn’t wild on heavy-hitting flavor, the slow-cooked meat and unusual inclusion of peanut butter gives it a heartiness that’s perfect for a chilly night in the mountains.''Adobo''Ah, adobo. How I could sing your praises from the rooftops for all time. Adobo is the name of the sauce, a tangy, salty, thick confusion of flavor that covers almost any meat, though chicken and pork are the most common. Here’s the thing with adobo: you’ll never get the same dish twice (unless you order seconds from the same restaurant). The ingredients of adobo vary widely depending on which island you’re on, or even which city you’re in. The most common is black adobo, a mix of vinegar and soy sauce simmered with loads of garlic, peppercorns and bay leaf. The meat that’s cooked in this sauce usually has bones in it, adding to the''yum''factor. On a bed of white rice, it’s savory heaven on a plate.''Lechón''I know, enough with the pork already, right? But''dang''can the Filipinos cook a pig! This one is slow-roasted over a fire for hours until the meat is tender and juicy. You can find Lechon all over the Philippines, but if you only try it one place, try it in Cebu. There,''lechon''is stuffed with a mix of lemongrass, star anise, bay leaf, and other delicious spices, and roasted until the skin is extra crispy. The infusion of flavor in the meat and contrast of textures of crispy skin and shredded meat will have you eating until you’re comatose.''Pancit''Photo: Pancit Bihon Guisado/Kawaling Pinoy''A whole article on Asian cuisine and not a noodle in sight? Well, here comes''pancit''to save the day. In Tagolog,''pancit''literally means noodles, so the second word is important to know exactly what you’re getting. There are literally dozens of varieties of''pancit'', with specialties for each region. Want to get to know the region you’re visiting better? Get the local version of''pancit''. Two popular and common varieties are''pancit palabok''and''pancit bihon.''Bihon is stir fried veggies, meat and noodles (think pad thai but with thinner noodles, less spice and more citrus). Palabok is shrimp, pork belly and host of textures and flavors from other toppings (crushed''chicharon'', fresh green onions, hard-boiled eggs) over boiled noodles.''A Sweet Treat''Ube Ice Cream''If Dr. Suess made an ice cream, this would be it. It’s bold purple color comes from''ube''(pronounced OOH-bay), which is a purple yam that makes an appearance in many Filipino desserts. When made into ice cream it tastes… well, kinda like a yam. Some vendors add coconut milk, which gives it a bit of a toasted coconut flavor. You may be confused at the first taste, but after the third, you may even go for another scoop!''Halo Halo''Photo:''Halo Halo''/bingbing/''Creative Commons''One look at his wacky concoction might make you want to but the cup down and slowly back away. A cacophony of colors and textures, halo halo is shaved ice and evaporated milk piled atop a mixture of almost anything sweet: from fruits like plantain and jackfruit, to jello, to beans that have been sweetened. This is then usually topped with a scoop of ube ice cream. Just the colors of this dish make it a show-stopper, and it definitely delivers on it’s promise of a sweet (and refreshing!) treat.''Leche Flan''Photo Credit with Permission: Kawaling Pinoy''The recipe for flan came with the Spanish, who ruled the island nation for over 300 years. Naturally, the Filipinos took the European recipe and made it their own. Though it looks very similar to the European counterpart, Philippine flan is denser and (in my opinion) packs more flavor-per-bite. If you like vanilla and caramel, don’t miss this.''Bring the Philippines to You''Hungry yet? One of the easiest Filipino dishes to replicate is''adobo'', and fortunately it’s one of the most delicious. This is pure Filipino comfort food, so pick a chilly night and fire up the stove for this slow-cooked feast. You can sub pork for chicken if you’re not a pork eater — A mix of bone-in wings and thighs or boneless cuts cut into 2” pieces will work with this recipe, though the cooking time might be reduced if you use boneless chicken.''Recipe: Pork Adobo''Serves 4''Ingredients:''2 ½ lbs. Pork shoulder, rump or belly, cut into 2” pieces''¼ cup white vinegar*''⅔ cup soy sauce''1 tbsp whole black peppercorns''8 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed''2 – 3 dried bay leaves''1 cup water''That’s it! Too easy…''Directions:''Combine all ingredients (except bay leaf) in a large bowl, cover, and let marinate at least 1 hour, up to overnight. The longer the better! Stir it a couple of times to make sure all the meat gets coated.''Pour the marinade and mixture into a heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the water and bay leaf, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer, covered, until the meat is tender (about 1 hour – 90 minutes).''Drain the meat in a colander set over a bowl (so you can save the sauce, you’ll need it!). Heat a pan with a bit of oil over high heat and brown the meat on all sides.''Once the meat has been browned, remove it from the pan. Add the saved sauce to the pan and heat, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any brown bits left in the pan.''Place the pork on a bed of rice and top with the sauce.''*Any type of vinegar works for this, though it will subtly change the flavor. I prefer white vinegar because I love the strong tartness, but playing around with different flavors is fun. Adobo is a very forgiving dish, so as long as the proportions are the same, have fun!''With such a rich culinary history, choosing what to eat in the Philippines is tough. If you are more adventurous, there are plenty ‘I dare you’ foods found on street carts all over the cities: Betamax (fried congealed blood, anyone?) and balut (duck embryo) have been luring extreme eaters for ages, though these are just normal snacks in the Philippines. Plus, there are about 20 more dishes that weren’t listed in this article that are just as delicious as the ones included! One thing I can say for sure?

It is, however, a long one, so start while it’s still the AM.''Part of the trail – totally flat for most of it''As long as you don’t have any major joint problems, even if you’re not the fittest when it comes to hiking, the flatness of this trail makes it traversable for the masses.

It was a layover from''the Maldives''that I decided to deplane for. It wasn’t really planned, it was more about taking the opportunity to explore a place that hadn’t been on my radar before.''I didn’t have any idea of what Sri Lanka would be like. It’s only quite recently that the''26-year\xa0civil war\xa0ceased''and it started to become a hub for tourism, particularly in the harder-hit east and north, so there just wasn’t much info out there on it yet.''These days, the driver and I agree, there are more and more people coming from abroad to visit this gorgeous place.''I have certainly seen the growth since I’ve been gone.

Phones don’t perform very well in low-light settings and nothing in this post involves flash, as I believe it’s the ruiner of landscape photography.''Most DSLR cameras will do the trick in low light, and everything in this post was shot on my''Sony a6000''with a''wide-angle lens''(though the lens doesn’t have to do with the ability to shoot in low light. It’s just the one I use and love the most).\xa0I also recommend a''cheap tripod from Amazon''. (You can find the rest of the gear I use''here)''.''You also have to be able to see what you’re doing and then to easily be able to turn that light off again so that the light doesn’t wash out the foreground of your photo.

This means that you also need to set a timer release when you take the photo so that the movement from your hand pressing the button doesn’t cause the camera to move as it’s taking the photo. You can also use a remote or even your phone if your camera is able to connect to your phone (mine is).''In manual, you can change up the settings for three main things as it pertains to your low-light photos:''Aperture''is the F-stop and the number will get\xa0lower as the light outside decreases. For example, at night, you are probably going to want an F-4 or lower.''Shutter Speed''This is the amount of time that the shutter is open to take the photo. It will get longer as it gets darker and this is why it’s important not to move the camera or anything you’re taking a photo of, unless you want it to move to create a cool effect, like water.''ISO''has to do with your camera’s sensitivity to light. The lower the number, the less sensitive your camera is to light which basically means that in lower light you can allow more light into the photo, but this also increases the “noise,” or grainyness of your photo.''Here are a few examples and my settings for each:''If it’s cloudy''Sometimes clouds can ruin a perfect summer day\xa0but I often find that they can contribute to making a photo better as long as you know how to make cloudy weather work for you.''I’ve been to Lago di Braies in''South Tyrol, Italy'', twice but it’s very normal to have a bit of cloud cover there. No big deal, because the color of the lake is so stunning it needs no competition from a blue sky.''A selfie taken as the sun was setting''For this shot, I put my camera on a tripod and set it to F14, ISO 100, and a 10-second exposure. I also set it to a 10-second timer and went and stood in the photo. You can see that my shirt, hair, and left hand\xa0moved a bit. I’ll blame a light breeze for the first two issues but admit I must’ve moved my hand.''I love the glassy look of the water in this picture, and recommend this setting if you want to make the water look like mist in your photos in low-light situations\xa0(during daylight you’ll need a filter, but''that’s another post subject entirely'').''If it’s blue hour''Blue hour is the hour before the sun rises in the morning or after it sets in the evening. If you’re near water, this is a great time to get an ethereal night shot that makes the water look like mist without needing a filter to combat the excessive light coming in.''A selfie taken as the sun was setting''About 30 minutes\xa0after the first picture in this post, I\xa0strung up some VARTA Consumer lights, put on a''headlamp'', and placed some of the smaller LED lamps around to make the photo look even more magical. I love the way that adding a few lights to a photo can really warm it up even if it otherwise looks dark and cool. This can be a total game changer to making an otherwise dark picture seem warm and inviting.''I changed my settings to F4 (to let in more light), ISO 100, and 20 seconds. Once again, I had to hold very still for the picture.''Tip:''If you want to be in the picture, stand farther away from the camera and use a friend or a remote to take the picture for you. That way, even if you move a bit, it won’t be as obvious.''Also, headlamps almost always make night photography look even cooler by adding a warm streak to the photo and shining out into the distance.''If it’s almost completely dark''Stars are already out. Taken at Camping Corones during my''camper van adventure in South Tyrol, Italy''.''When the sun is completely down and barely any light is left, you’ll want to find some way of lighting up whatever subject you’re taking a picture of, unless it has some light of its own.''I\xa0either do this by flashing my headlamp light in the direction of my subject for a second or so, or by adding some light to the picture, as I did with the string of lights in the camper van, plus the lanterns inside of the van and up in the roof tent for this shot.''Since there was so much light already in the foreground, I put my camera on a tripod, a 10-second timer, and F2.6, ISO 2000, and a 6-second exposure.

I am a waterfall enthusiast so it looked immediately appealing when I Google imaged it (it’s a verb, it must be).''This waterfall cascades down in several parts, and after it’s rained, be forewarned that the water will be spilling down the steps as well, so bring waterproof hiking boots.''Since I didn’t have mine with me, I went barefoot. That’s also an option!''I climbed through part of the waterfall to get here with my tripod, but the resulting shot was worth the risk!''Once you get to the top, you’ll notice that to the right of the waterfall is another trail that leads to yet another waterfall. I’m unclear on which one is the actual Bad Urach Waterfall but if you have time, hike to both. They both look like fairies and wood nymphs must live there:''How is this even real?!''Surely it’s a magical fairy glen''What’s so cool about this region in general is that it’s not nearly as touristy as Bavaria, Berlin, or Hamburg (etc.), so when visiting these places, it’s mostly locals around and not bus-loads of people. If you go during the off season and on a weekday, you might not even see anyone else there!''Getting there:''You can either drive to it or take the train from Stuttgart main station and get off at Bad Urach Wasserfall. Then turn to your right from the train platform and walk until you see the trail. It’s not hard to find!''Tübingen''Tübingen is an adorable little university town that I’d had the pleasure of seeing in the snow.

How perfect! I can say with certainty that the other one at that very moment was positively mobbed with tourists.''Getting There:''To get to the viewpoint, the Zellerhornweise, you’ve got to take a car to''this hotel''then walk to your right (with the hotel to your back).

Here are a few ways to combat the fears:''Give Your Fears Names''The more I have practiced mindfulness meditation the more I have learned to observe my thoughts as just what they are – things coming into my mind, usually with the intention of helping me even though they do the opposite. But they are just thoughts and they are not''me''. They do not have to define me.''Sometimes it helps to just say to them, “oh hey, pain!”, “oh hey, fear!” Kind of like acknowledging a little barking dog or a cricket that makes a whole lot of noise for its tiny body.''Fears are just fears – take the plunge''Observing and conceptualizing these fears as little beings that are not you when they come up might help you to stop them from taking over your thoughts entirely.''Have a plan in place''What is it exactly that you’re scared of? Is it money? Is it safety? Is it the fear of loneliness?''I find that having a clear answer to each of these potential problems is really helpful. Am I worried about running out of money? Then I will have a financial plan in place. Am I worried about safety? Then I will learn about the precautions I need to take (''this list from 31 solo female travelers''is a good place to start!).''You can also''check out my book''for a boat load more detail on each of these things.''Going solo can be amazing''Know that most personal safety problems stem from being alone at night or getting too intoxicated – these are things you can avoid!''Unfortunately, there are jerks out there who prey on people who are by themselves at night, or too drunk to defend themselves.''They know no sex or gender.

You already know that you won’t be alone too much because you will meet plenty of other people, you don’t have to worry about planning everything out yourself, and you still get to have a really amazing travel adventure without all of the responsibilities falling to you.''It’s the call that I made when I traveled through Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia on a tour instead of going solo. When I returned to Africa 2 years later, I had more confidence to do the trip independently with our own vehicle. I had a better idea of what I was dealing with.''I think the key is to find a tour that specifically calls to what you want. If you want something adventurous and to be with people who are like-minded, pick one that really feels right to you.''Since I wanted to put something out there that I didn’t feel really existed yet, I created tours that combine adventurous elements as well as authenticity and a small group atmosphere. Our first one is in Peru''you can learn more about that here.''We’ll swim with these guys''Take care of your valuables''Carry a dummy wallet, use''gear that is theft proof'', and insure your belongings so that if someone tries to rob you, you’re not too worried about it.''Usually most unfortunate incidences around traveling just have to do with petty theft.

It’s rugged and tough landscape that tested my limits but was\xa0so easy to fall in love with at the same time.''I did several treks, some were just one day and others spanned several days or even more than a week. With the right gear and knowledge, Patagonia can be\xa0enjoyable despite the elements and without many mishaps.''Here’s what I learned about trekking and camping in Patagonia:''Get the guidebook for solo female travelers''1) You seriously do need hiking boots''I’ve trekked in''Nepal'',''China'', and all over the States in running shoes and thought they were great. The biggest difference is in Patagonia the trail is often super muddy, very rocky, or totally wet. Sometimes there isn’t really even a trail and you have to go by GPS.''There were SO many times when I was really glad to have waterproof shoes that I could just trek through the mud with and not care. They were one of the most important things to bring along.''Here are the ones I recommend''.''This rocky trail is pretty typical in Patagonia''2) … and thick socks''The easiest way to avoid blisters is to reduce friction. That meant wearing thick socks and tying my boots very snugly when I trekked. When I did develop blisters, it really helped to keep my shoes tight and my socks thick to keep them from getting bigger or worse, tearing.''3) Bring Compeed''Compeed''is so much better than Band Aids! These blister bandages are the best I’ve found, and they stay on for several days as well. Bring them with you as they may not be possible to replace everywhere in Patagonia (I actually never found them when I looked for them there).''4)\xa0Bring the right clothing with you''You can experience all kinds of different weather within the span of a few hours in Patagonia. I trekked through tons of rain, very heavy winds, and even snow over the two months that I was there. It can feel quite extreme at first, but in time you do get used to it and it even becomes part of the enjoyment of Patagonia.''However, it’s only fun if you have warm, waterproof clothing. Here’s my''packing list for Patagonia to help''!''Wind breaker, sunglasses, warm hat, check''5) Get a tent suited for Patagonian weather''A normal tent isn’t going to be a good choice in Patagonia, where winds can reach upwards of 100km/hour. That is some''serious''wind and the shape of the tent, plus strength of the tent poles, both matter a lot so that nothing breaks while you’re midway through a trek.''I used an''MSR tent''that was resilient and super light to carry at the same time. The shape is designed for wind and the rain jacket kept us dry, except for one occasion when the rain was so heavy that everyone woke up wet (it does happen).''The tent at Refugio Grey on the Torres del Paine hike''6) For the love of God, do not buy your camping gear in Argentina''In the past I’ve bought a bunch of my camping equipment in the local country before the trek. It saved me a lot of money and the trouble of carrying the equipment around. This is not true at all in Argentina. Seriously do not buy any of your gear there!''I saw a North Face bag on sale for $300 that would have been $50 back home. Absolutely everything was overpriced in every single store I checked. Just bring it from home, seriously.''7) But honestly Chile isn’t that much better''There were a few things that I had to buy in Chile, like my sleeping bag and hiking poles. The price was closer to what I would pay back home, but I think I could have saved more by ordering stuff on Amazon and just bringing it with me.''8) Get lightweight cooking gear''Trekking with pots and pans is not a possibility for me. It’s just way too much weight and when you have to carry a week’s worth of food on your back, it’s already heavy so why make it worse?''I found this''foldable pot that doubles as a pasta strainer''and thought it was great. It’s super light and the quality is good. I used it for cooking everything I ate.''9) Hiking sticks are here to help you''Some people think hiking poles make them look dorky. I don’t care. I like the idea of protecting my knees and redistributing the weight. Plus, hiking poles saved me from face-planting into rocks more than once when wind gusts caught me by surprise.''It’s also good to have poles\xa0that aren’t super heavy, and as they get lighter, the cost usually goes up, so I''opt for something in the middle''.''Okay so I usually didn’t take pics with the poles but I did have them on every hike!''10) Avoid those dumb sporks''When you’re looking at stuff to buy for your trek, you’ll see these half-fork, half-spoon with a knife at the end of one of the fork blades. It looks like a great idea. You can slice your food then pick it up with the fork to eat it!''False – it’s really hard not to cut your face on the knife part. Why was it designed that way, and how did I fall for it?''11) Life will be so much better with powder, not cans''It’s hard to resist easy things like canned tuna (btw, not for me, ew) and sauces. You have to pack those cans up and back out, though. That’s a lot of extra weight for not much gain.''My milk was powdered, as was all of the sauce and soup that I used for cooking. Some people even bring entire meals made out of powder that you just add water to.\xa0When water is as easy to get as it is in Patagonia, why not get things that are light until you add water?''Breakfasts in a bag''12) Rain-proof your stuff''Rain covers tend to blow off or just be incredibly annoying when the wind catches them, making tons of noise right in your ear.''I didn’t bring a rain cover. I lined my bag with a bin liner and put my clothes, food, and electronics all in their own plastic bags as well. The backpack could get wet – no problem, and the stuff inside stayed dry.''13) Get a hat that won’t blow away easily''Go for a hat that\xa0keeps your head warm, your face covered from the sun, and your ears warm in the wind. This hat ticks all the boxes.''I kind of felt like a dweeb wearing it but then again,\xa0my face was protected and my ears were covered. Two birds, one stone, really.''My dorky hat''14)\xa0It’s pretty nice to have a lightweight, warm sleeping bag''It gets seriously\xa0cold when you’re sleeping next to a glacier. I got snowed on as well in Torres del Paine, so having a warm sleeping bag that was also super lightweight was a life-saver. This is a non-negotiable item, along with a good tent, in order to enjoy the camping part of trekking in Patagonia. You’ll want it to be at least''comfort level of 0-degrees Celsius''.''15) It’s worth it to get a thick sleeping mat''I spent around $20 on a mat that was lightweight but also pretty useless on bad ground. I encountered a lot of roots and rock and think things would have been a lot better if I’d brought a thicker\xa0mattress. They do weigh more but only slightly and that’s something I would probably have been willing to carry.''I would probably use''something like this''in the future.''16)\xa0\xa0Most water on the trails is clean, but when it’s not,\xa0sterilize it with''this''Most of the water is glacier water in Patagonia and it’s some of the cleanest on earth. However, especially in Torres del Paine, some campgrounds have had trouble with the increase in tourism and due to some campers doing things like washing in the streams or worse, some of the water has been making people sick.''I bring a steripen along on long treks. I never want to worry about the water or be without it, so I just sterilize it with a''Steripen''.''PLEASE:''It’s up to everyone who hikes in Patagonia to work together to keep the water safe. Too often I saw idiots jumping into the glacial lakes, swimming in streams, or washing their bowls directly in the water. This water trickles down and effectively makes campers drink your bathing or dirty dish water. That’s not cool. Take water into a clean bowl and walk at least 100 paces away before washing, same goes for using the bush toilet. Please think twice before getting that swimming selfie – it’s incredibly selfish.''17)\xa0You can eat the Calafate berries''They have thorns and are not to be confused with the little red berries also growing on the ground, but Calfate berries, as long as''you know what they look like'', are nice snacks to have along the trails, especially on the''Huemul Circuit''.''Picking berries''18) Here’s a useful camping food list''Powder, carbs, nuts, oatmeal, chocolate, and fruits. Those are always in my trekking pack because they weigh the least and give me the most energy.''A day’s packing list:''one portion oatmeal with milk powder and chocolate powder to taste''100 grams of dried fruit and dried nuts''1 small chocolate bar''one portion pasta and powdered sauce plus slices of salami and/or cheese for dinner''For lunch, I pretty much always ate nuts and dried fruit. That way I could just keep going without having to stop. Dinners always had a treat in them of salami or a cheesy sauce (yes, a rare moment when I was willing to eat cheese) just to keep it nice and interesting. I also experimented with cous cous and powdered potatoes and think they’re both great options for hot dinners as well.''one week’s worth of food and gear in Patagonia and why yes, that is a metric ton of Snickers bars''Since I was going to Patagonia with my friend Steve who has been there before and already knew that powder was the way to go, I\xa0was able to lighten my food load significantly by not bringing cans or liquid sauces. I’m so glad that we didn’t make the mistake of bringing all that weight!''Also, Steve\xa0has a pretty helpful guide specifically for''Torres del Paine hiking here'', with park entrance prices and campground info, that I’d suggest in conjunction with this post!''19) You’ll need this kind of cooking grill''It’s forbidden to have open fire in just about every national park in Patagonia, at least that I’m aware of.''A little camping stove''that you attach to gas cans, available in the\xa0sporting goods stores in Patagonia, is best for trekking.''20) Bring a headlamp!''Because using your phone as a flashlight is going to get annoying really quickly.''I like this waterproof one''.''Plus they’re cool props for night sky photos''21) …and a''portable charger''So that you can recharge your phone and cameras.''This is the one that I use.''(click here for more''info on my camera gear'').''22) …and mosquito repellant''Yep, they do exist sometimes in Patagonia.''23) …and sunscreen!''Make sure to always lather up when trekking in Patagonia, or anywhere for that matter. A sunburn when trekking is the worst!

You can hike up to the Rifugio Alpe di Tires 2440 M as well from the valley, which is accessible by public transport (In my case, I took a Jeep up as we were low on time).''Guten Morgen''It’s a rather easy hike with a few short and steep upward parts between the Rifugios. On a clear day you can see layers upon layers of mountains and valleys in every direction. I also loved how different this hike looked coming and going. I was like doing two totally different hikes!

It was with Carnival Cruises’ new project, Fathom Impact, and it would be a volunteer cruise to the Dominican Republic.''Okay, I’m skeptical, but I’m listening'', I thought.''I’d volunteered before, but that was with Big Brothers Big Sisters when I still lived in California. It had nothing to do with voluntourism, and I’d been on a cruise ship just once, for 3 days, when I was 14.''Now normally, I’d say a quick no to a typical cruise. I don’t like how they go from port to port and you just get a very cookie-cutter experience. However this didn’t look like the typical cruise at all.''I’ve also been skeptical and unsure about volunteering during my\xa0travels, but I also want to be open to trying new things, and to giving back sometimes, so I decided to give it a try.''Besides, the warm Dominican Republic sure did sound nice.''I mean, it’s pretty gorgeous-looking''The Boat''I boarded Fathom’s second voyage to the Dominican Republic in May. Unlike most cruise ships, this one is much smaller\xa0and therefore the crowds are too.''This was part of my reason for being open to Fathom. I liked the idea of being surrounded by people who were interested in a little something different as compared to a normal cruise.''The ship at the dock in the DR''I also really liked the idea of sleeping on a ship – something I’ve done several times in the past''on dive boats''and always loved. Being able to travel without packing up and moving each day, and sleeping through the transit were appealing as well.''Additionally, I really dig that you can eat on a cruise ship pretty much any time you want to, because I’m a hungry person, and that they had a gym, a pool deck, and a gorgeous library as well.''I definitely loved having this balcony, and not having to pack up and move for a whole week! Big bonus of a cruise''The Volunteering''As I mentioned before, I liked this cruise because it gave us\xa0the potential to go into the community and to get to know and meet the local people,\xa0something that I think other cruises lack.''I scanned the volunteer options carefully. I’ve read the''problem with little white girls''and I wanted to be helpful, not harmful or completely impact-less.''They have lots of options, from working at a women’s cooperative where they make and sell recycled paper art, to planting trees and prepping seedlings, to teaching English to locals.''I chose to teach English,\xa0something I enjoyed in the past when''I lived in Taiwan''.''A gorgeous beach at sunset in the DR''I boarded a bus to drive from the port a full hour away to the rural area where we’d be teaching, locals waving to us all along the way. I was happy to see that those who worked on the ground, organizing the activities were locals. I also learned that they continue the lessons after we leave.''I arrived at the volunteer destination to a group of smiling and incredibly enthusiastic people of all ages. I felt like they were truly happy to have us there, which encouraged me immediately.''I taught to a young boy, and out of respect for he and his home, focused on the lessons instead of taking photos, so my apologies for the lack of imagery from the session.''I left feeling like it was really good program and one that the locals are grateful to have, though I wish it had been longer, because I could have happily stayed there all day helping him practice his numbers and how to say “good morning,” and, “good afternoon.”''I think Fathom is running some great programs there that I can feel good about.

I found the people to be sweet and friendly and loved the landscape as well. There are waterfalls, beaches galore, and as I was told by some others on the ship, good nightlife as well.''The volunteer activities are a free offering on the ship, but in order to explore more of the DR, you can do some of their paid organized activities or in my case, rent a car and explore on your own. I was with four other bloggers and Instagrammers so between the five of us, a rental car was only $25 each for three days.''Just be forewarned – driving in the Domincan Republic is like playing frogger and chicken at the same time. If you scare easily on the road you might not want to do a rental there. Public busses run through the island as well!''Salto de Limon''My biggest highlight was the''Salto de Limon waterfall''. Maybe we’re a bit crazy but in order to reach it from the boat dock at Amber Cove by 8am so that we could photograph it without shadows or other people, we got in the car at 3:30am and drove the empty streets all the way there.''Gorgeous (photo of me by''@asenseofhuber'', my edit)''Once there you can hire a local guide to take you down – it would be a bit easy to take the wrong path otherwise. They can also rent you some rubber boots to deal with the mud, which I highly recommend. We paid $6 per person for the guide, plus a $3 park entrance fee at the bottom. These rates seem to always be negotiable and they’ll start high at first.''If you’re interested in gorgeous beaches, take a right out of Amber Cove and drive along until something catches your eye. To the left, they tended to have more trash.''Overall, my experience with Fathom was really good. I felt relaxed on the boat and I enjoyed my time in the DR. (You can read more about their''programs in the DR and Cuba here''.)''Would I try volunteering on the road again? I would love to. I think that teaching English is an excellent way to give back because as a native speaker, I’m not taking a job away from a local and if the student is as enthusiastic as they were in the Dominican Republic, it’s a real treat for both of us.''Have you volunteered abroad before?

If you wanted. But who wants to do that?!''Indonesian cuisine is bursting with flavor, from spicy and addictive''sambal''to hearty and sumptuous''nasi goreng''. Skipping the chance the educate your palate on the variety of flavor within this beautiful country would be doing yourself a major disservice. So here’s a starter guide to Indonesian cuisine.''First, A Primer on Language''There are few words that are important to know if you want to order like a local. I’ve outlined the most important vocabulary (you can pick up the rest when you visit).''Nasi = Rice''. As one of the most popular starches in Indonesia, this will be a frequent menu item at the fanciest restaurant or most humble''warung''.''Mie = Noodles''. The second-most popular starch (or some may argue first), this will also feature prominently in traditional Indonesian dishes.''Ayam = Chicken''. The most versatile of meats is also one of the most popular throughout Indonesia, so knowing the name for it is important (or you may end up with brains!).''Goreng = Fried''. In country where the fried rice and fried chicken are both''spectacular'', it’s important to know what you’re looking for on a non-translated menu.''Warung = Cheap Restaurant''. This is where you’re most likely to find the bang for your buck with traditional Indonesian cuisine. You can still find great eats at the pricier (and more touristy) restaurants, but definitely give the''warungs''a try!''The Dishes Not to Miss''(And Where to Eat Them):''Narrowing this list down seemed''impossible''. I opted to go for a beginner’s\xa0guide, and I had to make some hard decisions just so I didn’t write a novel instead of a blog post. If this is your first visit, don’t leave without trying these:''Nasi Goreng – Fried Rice''Nasi Goreng, a staple in Indonesia''This is the one dish guaranteed to be\xa0on every menu in Indonesia, from humble street carts to the finest restaurants. You can order it any which way, from vegetarian varieties to recipes packed with meat (chicken and shrimp are the most common). What makes this particular fried rice so special? Maybe it’s the shallots and garlic, fried to perfection. Maybe it’s the sweet soy sauce that’s in''everything''in Indonesia. Maybe it’s the tiny hit of chili, to counterbalance everything else. Whatever it is, it’s a universally loved dish by locals and tourists alike. You can order this anywhere, but try to find a locally-owned''warung''to\xa0be sure you’ll get the most authentic recipe.''Mie Goreng – Fried Noodles''Not the biggest rice fan? Don’t worry, you won’t get left behind in Indonesia! With similar flavors but a different starch (and usually a tiny bit more chili), mie goreng is the noodle alternative to fried rice. It’s packed with veggies and your choice of meat, then doused in a perfect combination of sweet soy sauce, salty soy sauce, and oyster sauce. It makes for a perfect stop between beaches or bike ride stops. Get this one freshly made from the street vendors — so good.''Ayam Goreng''and''Ayam Goreng Taliwang''Fried chicken, Indo style. This is a delicious and hearty meal that you can find in almost any tourist center in Indonesia. For a special take on it, get the spicy version, Ayam Goreng Taliwang, in Lombok. Yogyakarta is also famous for their Ayam Goreng, which is poached in spices before it’s fried up. People rave that they’ll never go back to Colonel Sanders after getting a taste of this one. Many variations are served with a crispy topping called''kremes,''which lend a delicious crunch.''Ayam Goreng with kremes''(Photo: Midori/''CC-BY-3.0'')''The best place to taste?''Warungs''. Check''Ayam Goreng Suharti''in Yogyakarta,''Taliwang Irama''in Lombok, or the Gili Trawangan''night markets''.''Gado Gado''You have to eat your veggies, too! Gado Gado is an Indonesian salad, but there isn’t a leaf of lettuce in sight. It’s a mix of vegetables such as cabbage, string beans, bean sprouts, and cucumber, tossed in a supremely delicious peanut-based dressing (though some may argue it’s more like a sauce). The peanuts and ever-present sweet soy sauce,''kecap manis,''lend a sweetness to this dressing, which is amped up with spice from turmeric, ginger and chili.''Babi Guling''Slow-cooked pork is a pretty hard thing to hate eating. This Balinese specialty is rarely found in other parts of Indonesia, where a predominantly Muslim population means pork is a no-go protein. A whole pig is stuffed with shallots, garlic, galangal, lemongrass, and dried shrimp paste (and a TON of other things) and roasted for hours over a fire. There are several places to try this in Bali, with''Ibu Oka''in Ubud and''Sari Kembar''in Seminyak topping the most popular list. If you’re up for an adventure, there are''rumors of a super-secret spot in a backyard north of Canggu''that’s the best on the island, but it’s only available between 4 a.m. and 9 a.m.''Tempeh Goreng''Tempeh Goreng, ready to be plated''Tofu. It’s just for vegetarians, right? Nope! Not when you ferment it, smother it in a sweet sticky sauce, and fry it up. Then it’s just plain delicious, no matter what your opinion on meat might be. The sweetness is offset by the perfect hit of chili, and each bite makes your mouth sing an ode to joy. You’ll definitely come back for seconds (or thirds!) of this unique dish.''Sate/Satay''Satay cooking over a coconut husk fire''Take any kind of meat, pop it on a stick, and grill it over a charcoal fire. Okay, maybe it’s not''quite''that simple, but this meal certainly is. There are dozens of satays all over Indonesia, but the most common is Sate Ayam, or chicken satay. Marinated in a mixture of turmeric, sweet soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and a few other aromatics, these are then grilled to perfection on a charcoal grill and served with a yummy peanut sauce and steamed rice for a simple but tasty meal. Get these from the street carts or market stalls — they do it right.''Rendang''When CNN Travel readers vote a food''the best in the world'', you know you should probably pay attention. Each bite of''rendang''is an explosion of flavor: earthy cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon wage war with tart kaffir lime, lemongrass, and tamarind, which battle it out with sweet toasted coconut, palm sugar, and coconut milk. All this (and more) is stewed down to nothing with some beef and''plenty''of chili to assault your tastebuds so thoroughly they have no choice but to be pleased. This dish originated in Sumatra, so your best bet is to get it there, but''Warung Bernadette''in Ubud also gets good reviews for their version.''Photo:''Beef Rendang''/''Alpha''/''CC-BY-SA-2.0''Pepes Ikan''After all that fried food, how about some light, refreshing steamed fish? Heavy on citrus with a dash of rich curry sauce, white fish is steamed in a banana leaf. That makes it the perfect foil to a long week of belly-busting fried eating. Lemongrass, tamarind, lime or lemon juice and lemon basil offset the turmeric and chili in the sauce, and steaming this fish keeps it delicate but packed with flavor.''Warung Sabar''in Amed, Bali gets rave reviews for their version, and''Warung Mendez''in Ubud does a great one too.''Sambal''Okay, this technically isn’t a''dish'', but it deserves mention in any article about Indonesian food. Sambal is not quite a sauce… it’s more like a relish. Made of fiery chili. But it is''so''good. It can be added to almost anything to increase the fire factor, and a little dollop here and there can make an already-yummy dish just sing with flavor. Don’t be afraid of the red sauce on your table when you dine out in Indonesia! Add a little taste to whatever you’re eating — you won’t regret it.''Sambal''(Photo: Irwandi Mazwir/''CC-BY-2.0'')''Martabak Manis''If you’re like me, no meal is complete without a little something sweet at the end. Enter: Martabak Manis (a.k.a. Terang Bulan). It’s a cross between a pancake and cake, but stuffed with any of a dozen delicious ingredients (like chocolate, or Nutella, or bananas, or condensed milk). You can find them at street carts all over Indo, and trying the different varieties is half the fun.''Beverages Not to Miss''Coffee –''kopi''Kopi Luwak, a.k.a. Cat Poo Coffee''When you’re in the nation with a whole region called Java, it’d be pretty silly to miss out on a cup of the stuff. Traditional Indonesian coffee is a hearty brew poured directly into a glass with sugar, grounds and all. If you’re particularly adventurous, you can try''kopi luwak'', which are coffee beans that have been digested (yes,''fully'') by a civet, which is like a cross between a racoon and a small leopard. The locals unceremoniously call it ‘cat poo coffee.’''Sweet Tea –''teh manis''If coffee isn’t your thing, consider Indonesian sweet tea. It’s iced, so it’s a perfect refresher on a hot and humid day. It’s sweetened with sugar and left mostly unadorned otherwise. You’ll find that the locals can’t live without it, and they can’t all be wrong, so give it a try.''Bintang''Frosty Bintangs on a hot afternoon''You haven’t been to Indo if you haven’t had at least''one''Bintang. This ubiquitous beer is a staple at just about any restaurant,''warung'', beach bar, or roadside shop. Like most Asian beers, it’s uncomplicated and highly drinkable in the heavy heat of the day (and night). A must-try when you visit.''Side Note:''Arak''is an Indonesian liquor that has''caught bad press''for causing tourist deaths from a lack of regulation of the beverage. Though it is''much''cheaper than imported alcohol, drinking it is risky, and I wouldn’t recommend doing so. In some cheap bars in tourist areas, beverages marketed as vodka or gin may actually contain''arak'', so drink with caution. If the price of a drink seems too good to be true, it probably is. And no drunk is worth your life. When in doubt, stick to beer.''Bring Indonesia to You''Summer is coming, so fire up your BBQ for an Indonesian feast!

What if she hadn’t worn a shirt that showed off her tattoo for goodness sakes? Where would I even be? What would I be doing?''Yvonne and I with our matching tattoos''The point of all of that is, you absolutely can never know who will come floating into your life, and conversely, who will go floating back out of it. Even small, seemingly insignificant encounters have the power to change everything, and you just can’t plan for that.''Rigid plans just cause stress''I feel like a lot of the reason why people ask me about my five year plan is because they are worried about their own future. It is really hard for them to understand the mindset of someone who just wings it.''The way I live my life does not fit any kind of mold that they understand. But honestly, if I made a five-year plan and things started to go in another direction, that could cause me a lot of stress.''I like to leave things up to chance sometimes''Do I believe that I should be actively contributing to my retirement accounts? Of course I do. Do I think that I need to have goals? Absolutely. Do I think that it is healthy to say that I have to have two children and be in the exact career that I want within the next five years? No, that kind of pressure really isn’t for me.''Think about it, are you even the same person that you were five years ago? Do you even want the same things that you wanted back then? How in the world can you know what the person who you become in five years will\xa0want? Sorry to be morbid, but how can you even know that you’ll still be around by then?''On living for today''My inherent problem with a five-year plan is that it suggests that what we are doing right now is not beneficial enough, that there must be something more.''I’m addicted to the possibility of more just like everyone else, but I also think it is important to acknowledge that where I am right now is really good. If where you are right now is not good, don’t wait five years to change it, do something now.''Buddhists say the clearest path to peace and contentedness is to be in the moment as much as possible. It’s about mindfulness. So often we remember things as sweeter than they were because in the moment that we experienced them we were actually stressing about the past or worrying about the future. Mindfulness\xa0is something that takes a lot of practice and ability and it’s a lifetime goal in itself, really.''That said, those moments of''flow'', when we are in the moment, are so pleasurable because it’s all about living for right now. This is yet another reason why planning for something so far in the future just doesn’t seem to make much sense to me. How can we plan for a time of flow, a''Eureka!''moment, a stroke of genius, or a random job offer we\xa0never saw coming?''Instead of this 5-year, phantom security plan, might I suggest that instead of worrying about the future, to just trust in the journey? Know that you will figure things out if and when you need to. In a pinch, believe in your ability to pull through. Know that adversity does, in the end, typically make us stronger and more capable people.''So that is my long-winded answer to whether or not I have a five-year plan. No, I do not, and I don’t think that I ever will.''Pin me!''I will, however, to leave the door open for randomness, serendipity, and the potential to tap into possibilities that exist beyond my front door. that is my life plan.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''A Year in Review: Year Five of This Solo Journey''A Letter to My 21-Year-Old Self on My 31st Birthday''Meet the 13-Year-Old Girl Who Travels the World''Quick note: This post should have come before the last one but due to some internet issues with uploading the photos, I had to flip flop them.

The landscape is unmatched in its rugged beauty, and the remoteness and desolateness of it all meant a truly off the beaten path experience that most foreigners don’t get to have in Patagonia (though if you read the rest of my posts on the subject I tell you how!)''It takes someone intrepid and in the know, and that’s what I liked the most about it.''Such a gorgeous place''Villa O’Higgins''The town of Villa O’Higgins, named after General Bernardo O’Higgins who lead Chile’s independence movement from Spain, is a sleepy, incredibly peaceful little town at the end of the Carretera Austral. From here, most people either take a boat onwards to Candelario Mansilla, truly one of the most remote parts of South America, or turn back several hundred kilometers towards Chile Chico in order to cross into\xa0Argentina.''There’s no way to take a car any further, but since Steve and I were just on foot, we elected to do a couple of day hikes in Villa O’Higgins, simply because it was such a pleasant place to be, and then hoof it onwards.''It’s the end of the road!''There I experienced my first parilla (BBQ) when a couple of locals whom we’d met at a sunset spot invited us to join, speaking Spanish very slowly for me so that I could understand.\xa0It was a really nice way to finish off the adventure that was the Carretera Austral, full of''hitchhiking adventures''and''gauchos''.''The boat and O’Higgins Glacier''A boat runs from the town of Villa O’Higgins to\xa0Candelario Mansilla, a small farm at the edge of the\xa0Lago O’Higgins, a few days per week. It costs roughly $100 to take the transport and also to stop at the glacier. Since this is such a remote part of South America, it’s a rare chance to be on a boat that visits a glacier and isn’t positively packed with tourists.''Looooove''Such a gorgeous glacier over a gorgeous green (yes, green!) lake''Plus, as a bonus, you get a glass of whiskey with some 10,000-year-old glacial ice inside. Who doesn’t love that?''I can dig it''The boat takes a few hours in total before docking at the\xa0Candelario Mansilla farm which doubles as a campground and guesthouse. This is where you can make a deal with the local gaucho to\xa0have his horses take your bags onward the next day. The only catch is, this is all dependent on him actually being there and wanting to have his horses work that day.''I didn’t get so lucky.''He came in around dusk as we were eating dinner (by the way, definitely get the dinner at the farm, it’s so good and cheap!) and said that the horses wouldn’t be available. My heart sank. I had a 70L backpack full of all of the things I had taken to Finland and Austria with me, plus an additional 10 kilos or so of tech equipment. I figured altogether it was probably about 20 kilos (like, almost 45\xa0pounds guys). I didn’t think there was any way that I could carry that the 22 kilometers (13.7 miles) all the way into Argentina.''For 10,000 CLP, he offered to take the bags partway in his car. That would leave 6 kilometers left to carry the bags. With no real choice in the matter, I simply had to do it (but I''really''didn’t want to!)''Sitting at the Candelario Mansilla, the edge of Chile''No-Man’s Land''I awoke early the next morning, left my big bag in the barn for the gaucho to take it in his Jeep, and got to walking with the morning sun and dew still on the leaves. In about ten minutes I was at the border post to leave Chile. I still remember the words inscribed across the entrance as I walked in:''“Though grave is my loneliness, stronger is my devotion to my country,”''(or something like that, given my rough Spanish abilities).''This is the most remote border post in Chile, but an important one as it’s an area that has been disputed in the past between Chile and Argentina. Word on the street is that the residents at the farm and Villa O’Higgins are not only honored for being willing to live in such a remote area, but are given a monetary incentive to do so.''Though it was absolutely gorgeous, you could not pay me to live at the end of the world.''The hike thereafter can only be described as a trek through no-man’s land. It’s neither Chile nor Argentina. It’s like being in two places at once, literally.''Patriotic trees''At some point the trees that bear Chilean flags come to an end, and there’s a sign welcoming you to Argentina. That’s where we ended up meeting the Jeep to pick up the bags for the onward journey.''The end of no-man’s land''Unfortunately for me, what lay ahead was the forested part of the trail. Before it had been a gravel road but it made way for a lot of ups and downs,\xa0tree roots on the narrow trail, and lots of super dense mud.''Imagine lugging 20 kilos on your back and front through calf-deep mud and trying not to fall on your face. That was a real challenge, and after a few much-needed periodic breaks, I can’t tell you how excited I was to finally see the Fitzroy.''Entering Argentina''This is a unique view of the Fitzroy as it’s a view from the back, totally different to\xa0the iconic view that you see on the Patagonia brand labels and post cards, and from the town of El Chaltén. There’s even a small campground at the border patrol station, right on the lake.''Such a cool view of the Fitzroy''Some people trek an additional 15km around the lake to get to a bus that can take them to El Chaltén, but by then, I was happy to fork over the $20 for the boat across the lake. This is a truly outrageous price all things considered, but I was also outrageously tired by then.''From there it was a hitchhike into El Chaltén, where I’d take on''the Huemul Circuit'', the most difficult hike I’ve ever attempted.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''The Best Hiking in El Chaltén, Argentina''Bariloche: Argentina’s Gateway to Patagonia''Hiking the Huemul Circuit: The Toughest and Most Rewarding Hike in Patagonia''You guys I feel like I’ve stumbled upon the holy travel grail.

The one at KLIA2 is no different. I searched for information about such a lounge online last\xa0night and found some info on this one, which I expected to have a big, bright sign. Not so, friends. It’s actually hidden within a spa!''I walked up to two unsmiling desk attendants after asking around and being pointed to a spa entrance. They looked at me like something the cat had just dragged in and maybe given my 3am wakeup in Bali to make my first flight, I indeed looked the part.''Confused, I asked if I was in the right place and was told that yes, I was, but I had to pay for one of three premium spa treatments for a 10-hour entry.''“The 90-minute massage for 330 Rinngit perfect for you,” one of them suggested.''Oh really? I’m sure.''I selected a 60-minute sugar scrub, since it was the cheapest that would grant me lounge access, and settled in for my have-to massage. It cost me 197 MYR, which is the equivalent of $48 USD.''At first it felt like someone was rubbing sand into my skin but eventually I melted like butter into the massage table and fell in love with the treatment. It was like someone scratching my back and legs and since my spirit animal is a cat I adored it.''Another room where they do hair treatments''I’d paid for 60 minutes but she gave me 90. I wanted to hug and kiss her. Following, I got the hot shower I’d been hoping for, with a free toothbrush, and then checked out the food situation.''You guys, it’s all you can eat breakfast, with eggs, beans, sausage, and coffee.''There’s even infused water. Holy mother of God! Orange and cucumber-infused water!''But that’s not all!''(I sound like an infomercial, don’t I?)''They switch out the food regularly throughout the day so that you can try different things. Oh and did I mention the all-you-want coffee, beer, and soft drinks? WITH chilled glasses? That’s the cherry on top.''It’s also super quiet in here, with faster, dedicated Wi-Fi and since nobody seems to know about this place, except for one other lady who exclaimed to me, “well this was a find wasn’t it!?” it’s super fast. There are plugs and swivel chairs everywhere which is convenient.''I also don’t have to constantly hear that annoying loud speaker announcing flights, though there is a screen in here so that I can make sure I get out of here on time for mine.''So I’ve paid $48 bucks for a massage, all the food I want, fast Wi-Fi, and all the coffee\xa0I want, too. This is a way better value than I could ever find by just going to food joints within the airport over the course of\xa012 hours.''If you want to find it, head up to the second floor of KLIA2 right after security, but before the second security that takes you to the gates. Find the McDonalds and right next to it you’ll see the spa. Ask inside if it’s the Plaza Premium Lounge just to be sure.''You’re welcome.''Pin me!''P.S. I paid my way in here.

I can appreciate that some places are way easier to navigate than others, and since I’ve seen all kinds of arrivals halls, from Kathmandu to London and Maputo to Buenos Aires, I’ve got you covered.''Here’s the best way to be so prepared for a trip (with minimal effort) that nobody can scam you and you can feel confident and excited for your trip, whether it be long or short, local or on the other side of the world. This is my methodology for traveling headache free:''Before you go''planning travels''1) Pick a place to go''I pick my destinations based on a lot of different factors and no two trips are the same. Maybe I heard that a place is great via word of mouth as was the case with''Mozambique'', saw incredible photos of it on Instagram as was the case with''Iceland'', or went there because I knew it was high-value, as was the case with''Southeast Asia''.''Generally I take three factors into account when making my decision:''Costs:''Can I actually afford that place? First I do a quick search of hotel prices and activities in the area so that I know what I’m in for. If it’s a long trip and I want to be able to enjoy it comfortably, I check in with my finances before booking. High season will impact costs, too, so I aim for shoulder seasons because the crowds are thinner but the weather is generally still nice. Check into high season with Lonely Planet.''Weather:''I check average rainfall, temperature, during my target month to make sure that it works for what I want at the moment. Sometimes I want snow and other times I want sunshine!''Sometimes, a cold place is\xa0what you want''Visas:''Lots of places have a visa-on-arrival option for me as a US citizen (it’s usually similar rules\xa0for Canadians, EU residents, Aussies, and Kiwis) but some are more complicated, like Mozambique, Russia, Brazil, Vietnam, and China to name a few. I find''Wikipedia''is a good resource for checking visa rules.''This is also a good time to think about any immunizations you might be missing. Want to visit Zanzibar? Make sure you have a yellow fever vaccination first!''Still struggling to pick a place? Here are my''favorites for solo travelers in Asia''and a few more''favorites worldwide''and the reasons behind my choices. If you need some inspiration check my''destinations page''for all of the places I’ve covered.''Shoulder season in Mozambique was perfect''2) Book a flight like a boss''The jury is out on the best time to book a flight. Some say it’s two months ahead of time for an international departure but to be honest, I’ve booked flights the week or even the day before and didn’t pay that much for it. The earlier you know your dates, though, generally the better.''I suggest signing up for newsletters for the airline that makes the most sense for your flight. For example, I’ve scored many cheap flights with Air Asia in Southeast Asia and Norwegian for Europe and the US by jumping on the deals they offer through their newsletters. I’ve also scored super cheap flights by following travel hacking websites.''Research away''It also pays to be flexible. If you have a week or so of wiggle room on either end or are flexible with the destination you’ll have a much easier time finding deals. Want to go to Europe, for example? Use programs like''Kayak.com/explore''and''Adioso''and select entire regions and you might find awesome deals.''It also helps to book in the local currency and language. Use the Chrome browser’s translate function to book the flight in these cases. I’ve saved a lot of money by buying flights in German for Europe and Spanish for South America.''3) Research what I want to do and book some things in advance''What’s your motivation for visiting a certain place? Do you want to ski, SCUBA dive, hike, make it a photography trip, or just chill? In some cases, you’ll want to book things ahead of time.''If it’s a popular ski resort, get your hotel booked quickly. I like''Expedia''and''booking.com''for this.''If it’s a diving hotspot and they restrict diving permits like in''Sipadan'', book as far ahead of time as possible to avoid disappointment.''If you want to hike, start practicing now! Go on walks and little side hikes whenever you can to get in shape.''I really like to leave as much up to serendipity as possible in my itinerary, so in places like Southeast Asia and Africa, I don’t worry too much about booking ahead unless it’s a holiday or a safari. In Europe and North America, though, it can get costly to wing it, so plan ahead in those places!''In Africa, found these guys thanks to serendipity''4) Get insurance''I always get insurance for my trips because it’s not that expensive and if I have a major health issue, I don’t want to get stuck with the bill or worse, end up in a healthcare system that I don’t feel comfortable with. Things can turn south quickly if something major happens and you can’t pay the bill.''The one I use,''World Nomads'', will fly me to a better hospital if the country I’m in doesn’t have adequate medical facilities. That would have come in very handy if I’d had a problem in Mozambique, Cambodia, Laos, Malawi, and a really long list of other countries I like to frequent. The explorer option also covers diving and hiking, two activities I do all the time. Most domestic insurance won’t cover you abroad so at least look into travel insurance before you go. Best case scenario you don’t need it but worst case you’re covered if you do.''5) Consider your packing list''Do you need to buy anything prior to your trip? Check out the following packing lists depending on your destination:''Europe in the Winter''Southeast Asia''Iceland''Ski trips''All suited up and ready to go''6) Get offline maps''Next I want to make sure I’m able to get around the place I’ve chosen with ease. The best way to navigate around where you’re going is to have an unlocked smart phone so that you can get a SIM at the airport, or an international plan with T-Mobile that provides coverage abroad. Don’t roam with other carriers or you’ll pay dearly for it.''In the case that neither of those options is available to you, download maps.me, which is an offline map that can help you navigate. Plot out the route to your hotel before you depart just in case your destination airport doesn’t have Wi-Fi. When you book, most hotels will also have directions on how to best reach them so read up on that first. If that’s not available to you, check out''WikiTravel''for suggestions on how to get to and around your destination. Cross reference with Google Maps while you’re still online to make sure that your offline map is accurate.''7) Read up on airport scams''Unfortunately, airports are prime locations for scammers. People there know that you’re tired, just walked off a flight, and might not know where you’re going. Avoid this by being prepared. Read up on the scams before you go on WikiTravel and never take an unmarked taxi.''8) Know the exchange rate''If you land with no idea what the local exchange rate is, you’ll be easier to scam. I use a free app called currency converter so that I’m in the know before I land.''When you land''9) Take your time, have a cup of coffee''Don’t feel the need to rush out the door immediately. If you need to stop and have a cup of coffee to feel human again after a long flight, do it! The arrivals gate can be overwhelming and there’s no need to rush into making a mistake or a bad decision.''10) Get cash''I’ve never met an airport arrivals that didn’t have an ATM. I never change money at airport counters because they’re pretty much guaranteed to give you a bad rate, but I do always stop by the bank at the airport to withdraw local currency. It offers me the best exchange rate and with Charles Schwab, all of my ATM fees are refunded. I already know how much I want to get out because of step #7. I usually go for the equivalent of $100-$150 to tide me over until the next ATM.''11) Get a local SIM''Most arrivals gates also have local SIM cards. It can vary by country, but most of the time it’s the same price or only slightly more expensive to get a SIM at the airport. I usually pay the difference, if it’s small, because wandering around in a foreign and confusing place looking for a SIM once I get to my accommodation isn’t worth it to me. If you have an unlocked phone, go for a local card. That way, you can order an Uber taxi if need be.''12) Be careful who you ask for advice''It’s always better to have a route in mind before you even land for getting to your accommodation, but if you missed that step, just be careful who you ask for advice. Many taxi and limo stands are marked as information desks but in reality they’re trying to sell a service.''I once asked a woman at an info desk in Bangkok what the best way to get to the other airport was and she replied that a $30 taxi was best. Then I asked if there was a bus and she, looking disappointed, pointed me to the free bus transfer counter. I’m glad I asked, because otherwise I would have paid $30 for nothing!''13) DO NOT take an unmarked taxi''Lots of airports have taxi stands before you exit the doors. They will usually give you the best rate and you’ll be able to get into a legitimate taxi. I also use Uber whenever possible, if I have a local SIM, because I find it’s also cheap and safe. Many airports also have trains and shuttle busses, so look into what works best for you before you choose any particular method.''When you’re there''Find cool things to do''14) Learn some local pleasantries''If you haven’t looked into it already, ask the people working at your accommodation how to politely say “hello” and “thank you”. It really goes such a long way to make people feel respected and the effort is often rewarded with praise or even some local suggestions for food and fun.''15) Ask where''not''to go''If there are any shady parts of town that you should avoid, ask the people working at your accommodation to point those out to you on a map. They should have one to show you.''16) Ask where to eat''I always ask the people working at the hotel I’m at to suggest some ‘non tourist’ places to eat. I ask them where they like to go when they’re hungry and have found some great food as a result.''Sometimes they still suggest a touristy place to me, but in that case, I follow a few standard rules:''If it’s on the beach, walk at least one, if not more, streets inland from the water. Same goes for the typical tourist streets''Pick a place crowded with locals, not tourists''The smaller and more unassuming but crowded with locals the better''Bonus if the menu is not also in English. Try to learn the names of local dishes from the hotel staff, Google, or blogs before you explore.''Otherwise, check''Yelp''. This won’t work everywhere but is a good bet in most Western countries.''17) If you don’t have anything planned''If you decided to wing it and don’t have any plans, try hanging in the common room if you’re at a guesthouse, especially around dinnertime. You might meet others in the same boat who you can join for dinner or the next day’s activities.''In lieu of that, I usually search Google for the destination name plus ‘travel blog’ or just go for Trip Advisor’s top activities in the area. WikiTravel is also helpful for finding things to do. Eventually you’ll get in the flow but these are good ways to jump-start the fun.''18) Fight the jet-lag''It’s hard to fight jet lag, I know. I once combatted it for a week, only awake when it was dark and unable to fight through the day to stay awake. It resulted in anxiety and depression and now I do everything I can to avoid a repeat. Here are my best suggestions:''Even if you’re tired, distract yourself until it gets late enough to be a reasonable sleeping hour. Stay outside, go to a restaurant, or find someone to hang out with. Don’t give in!''Don’t have a phone easily accessible while you sleep. It’s too easy to wake up in the middle of the night and start checking messages and emails, and by then, sleep will be hard to come by.''Eat meals at appropriate times. This actually has one of the largest effects on your ability to regulate what time it is to your body.''If you wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep, have a glass of wine and read a dense book. It tends to do the trick for me!''19) Make friends and have fun!''The rest of the trip is just about enjoying it, so laugh it up and drink it down as they say. Take some photos if you feel like it, chill out if you don’t.''Pin me!''This is my method for planning trips easily and without too much hassle and headache. It usually only takes me a few hours of research and before I know it I’m already good to go. Use the resources here to help you out with that planning and if you have any tips to add, comment away!''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''7 Easy Steps to a More Authentic Travel Experience''How to Quell Your Parents’ Fears About Your Solo Travels''How do You Know Whether to Plan Ahead or Wing It?''I stuck my arm out and latched onto a tree to prevent myself from careening down the trail.

In fact, it only made me want to do it more.''Standing there, I thought, “They were right but I don’t want to admit it,” while simultaneously wishing\xa0to myself that curling into a ball on the floor, melting into a puddle and dripping down the rest of the trail was an option.

I’d never experienced anything like it before.''This was NOT easy''Yet I knew that going back up would be worse than continuing on. Then I’d just have to do the same thing in the other direction, going back over the pass and to the\xa02-hour trail that was so narrow, one wrong step would mean falling all the way down to the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. There would be no walking out of that scenario. I really didn’t want to repeat it.''I had no choice, so I just kept going. I started wondering to myself why I was there. Was this actually even fun?''Then the bushes cleared and I could see a glimmering lake with ice bergs floating in it.

That view made me\xa0remember why I took on the challenge\xa0in the first place.''A glacial lagoon that was ours''That was on day three of one of the most difficult hikes I’ve done and yet somehow it’s (mostly) fond in my memories.''It started out with some information Steve, who''trekked the Huemul Circuit''three years ago (I could NOT understand his motivation for doing it twice), hadn’t bargained for.''“If you’re going to want to do this trek, you need a harness and carabiner to rappel across the rivers.”''Steve had just forded the river last time. Yes, he had forded the freezing river that was coming down from a glacier. And then just hiked in freezing wet pants afterwards. I liked the idea of the harness much better. We had to rent these in town and carry them to duration of the trek (and so will you).''You see, when Steve had been there previously, the metal wire with the pulley was broken. By the time we arrived it had been fixed again. I have no idea how often this thing breaks and certainly didn’t let myself contemplate it too much while actually on it.''The first rappel of two on the trek''Why in the world did we want to do this? We’d gone from rural areas without many, if any, other western tourists on the''Carretera Austral''to the much more popular and crowded El Chaltén and we wanted solitude again.''This circuit is difficult and technical enough to keep most people away, and it’s one of the only trails in Patagonia that you can see the Southern Patagonian Ice Field from. It’s also possible to get sunrise at the glacial lagoon all to yourself. Seriously, with nobody else there.''The Southern Patagonian Ice Field. This is one of the best views I saw in Patagonia. So amazing''The challenges: Most of the trail is not marked (download the Argentina map on the maps.me app\xa0before you go to help with navigating), three hours of the trail is almost straight down, and you must carry absolutely everything you will need on the trek, and I mean everything, including a carabiner and harness that you can rent from shops in town. The only thing you don’t need to bring is water.''Day One''Day\xa0one was rather pleasant. We left in the late morning and took it easy, checking in with the ranger\xa0office, registering (they’ll send out search and rescue if you go missing), and heading out on our way.''It was an easy hike from the town of El Chaltén through a bit of forest and a bit of open areas. There were sweeping mountain views and a casual glacier here, there, and everywhere.''Photo by Steve''At the end of that day it was seeming pretty easy. There were about 6 other tents all around and we cooked some pasta. Steve somehow managed to find it funny rather than annoying when I knocked down the boiled water twice trying to turn off the flame.''Day Two''For most day two, there’s no trail. The second day involves strapping on a harness first thing in the morning and pulling yourself across the wire rope. It’s much easier without a backpack on so send that across first to your hiking buddy.''The next few hours will be spent climbing over a rocky glacier moraine, then climbing hand and foot up a gravel trail for 1000 meters.''Well that’s a nice reward''It will be a challenge for sure. This is easily one of the steepest trails I’ve done, and I was VERY glad to have had walking sticks with that steepness. Thankfully\xa0the view is amazing during this part of the trail.

Otherwise, we were the only humans out there\xa0for days.''Gorgeous night shot by Steve''Day Three''Day three was the long and very tough one that I mentioned in the intro of this post.''The beginning was more or less fine. We woke up with the sun and packed up quickly, aware that it was a long day until we got to the glacier lagoon. We picked a few Calafate berries along the way and readied for the tough part.''Picking berries''The trail narrowed to the point that one false step would mean falling down all the way to the ice field. I was very aware that wasn’t something\xa0anyone would be walking out of.''Then we had another pass to climb up and over -the Huemul Pass. The wind picked up but it was in my favor and started to actually push me up the trail, much to my gratitude. Once I reached the top, I could finally see the glacial lake. Like much of the water in Patagonia, the minerals made it an intense aquamarine, coupled\xa0by the crystal clear\xa0water from the glacier.''Before the descent from hell''I’ve already waxed poetic on the descent thereafter earlier in the post, but suffice to say, it was steeper than anything I’ve ever tried and\xa0to add insult to injury, the plants poked and scratched me the whole way down.''Patagonia ain’t for pansies.''The downhill (see that loose dirt?)''That night we settled into a campground right on the water as the rain started to fall and the wind picked up. We found a tree to hide behind for cooking and finally tucked into the small bottle of whiskey we’d brought along, taking chunks of the ice out of the water because wouldn’t you want some 10,000-year-old glacial ice in your beverage? In the morning, we’d see the sunrise reflect on the ice bergs floating in the water and it would be glorious.''Day Four''The morning was peaceful and so many shades of gold and red, and unlike my experience in''Iceland''where there were a good 25-40 people, we were the only ones to see it. Seriously, we were the only people there!''The ‘bergs floating around at the Viedma glacier''Yep, wow''The hike out from there was more like the first day’s – it wasn’t too challenging, though it was long at 18km and by the time we reached the end, pulling ourselves across another pulley again, we were absolutely exhausted.''The thing is, at this point you have to try to find a bus. The busses coincide with incoming tourist boats that visit the glacier in the late morning and afternoon. Hitchhiking is also an option, which is what we did.''An American tourist who had summited Everest twice gave us a lift, congratulating us for completing such a tough circuit. It paled in comparison to what he’d done, of course, but I still felt happy to have taken on this challenge and dominated it, even though at times I didn’t think I could.''Patagonia, you’re always unexpected, always tough, and always gorgeous.''Pin me!''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''The Best Hiking in El Chaltén, Argentina''10 Hikes in Patagonia You Seriously Need to Experience''Patagonia Itineraries for One Week to One Month''Hey guys, you may or may not know that I once lived in London for about a month. I never wrote much about it, mostly because when I’m living somewhere I become less of a tourist there and usually hole up to get work done. That’s why I Cora from''The Path She Took''is here to give you a guide of the lesser-known stuff in London if you want a unique, less-touristy experience (words are Cora’s, photos are mine):''London is my favorite city. As I live in France, I usually travel there by bus, and I always feel this sense of comfort and joy when the view from the window suddenly opens up on the river Thames with Big Ben on one side and the London Eye on the other.''But the truth is, once you’ve seen these landmarks once, going there a second time would be rather boring. So, as I keep going back and back again to London, I’ve had to delve deeper and deeper into the city in order to find new things to discover!''I’ve compiled my best tips here on London – on how to get off the beaten path and experience things and places that not many travelers do. Conclude the day with a cup of tea with a drop of milk and you’ll almost be a Londoner!''The most London photo ever''Markets and Museums''Whenever I arrive in a new city, I always like to wander in a market. They’re always so much going on and it’s\xa0so full of locals. It’s a great way to fall into the rhythm of a new place.''In London, one of my favorite markets is''Petticoat Lane Market''on Sundays. It mainly sells clothes and everybody is haggling all over the place!''Camden Market''is more touristic but still amazing. I get lost in there every single time, but I don’t mind, since I always end up stumbling into a part of the market I hadn’t seen before. The vintage clothes and Asian food parts are my favorite!''There are''plenty''of good museums in London, and some of the famous ones are worth returning to several times, like the Tate Modern or the British Museum. But there are also some small ones, well hidden, but still fascinating.''The''Sherlock Holmes Museum'', obviously located in Baker Street, is a great place to visit for book nerds like me (or Benedict Cumberbatch fans, whatever). The rooms are full of little details, all faithful to the books, and there really are seventeen steps!''Feed the birds…''A Bit of Fresh Air''I like cities, but I need a bit of air, green and nature every now and then if I don’t want to start going crazy. London is ideal for me in that regard with all its squirrel-filled parks and gardens (careful though, these guys are cute but they have sharp teeth).''Hyde Park is huge and I could spend my whole afternoon in there. My favorite spot is the''statue of Peter Pan''in Kensington Gardens (in the continuity of Hyde Park) and the''Speaker Corner''. This place marked with a sign is an invitation for anyone who wishes to, to express themselves publicly on any subject they like. It can get pretty intense when the speaker talks politic or religion, but I love this freedom of speech.''The''London Wetland Center''is another outdoor space, but this one is completely surreal, not at all what you would expect of London. There’s a lot of wildlife in there too, living in the lakes and ponds.''As far as hidden corners go,''Little Venice''is also often forgotten. This little district on the canal is all peaceful and quiet, looking just like England and Italy had a baby. It’s even possible to get a boat ride all the way to Camden from there!''A gorgeous city''Weird and Creepy''Now we’re getting to the good stuff, because who doesn’t like a bit of weird and creepy in their life? Certainly not the Londoners, who managed to create a few spaces in the city just as eccentric as them.''Let’s go back to Hyde Park for the''Secret Pet Cemetery'', about 300 miniature headstones, overgrown with moss, engraved with a few words by grieving masters from the victorian times. You can peek at this oddity between the fences, for actually going in there is not easy. You have to arrange a special visit way in advance, and it might be rather pricey.''To stay on this happy subject,''Highgate Cemetery''is also a beautiful place, and I really mean the “beautiful” part, despite the obvious sadness and creepiness of the place. The tombstones are carved in a very creative way and there’s even a massive Egyptian avenue. The whole of it is overgrown and mossy just enough to have that “lost city in the jungle” feel.''No more cemetery from now on, I promise. Instead, let’s go to''Soho''. Although this district is one of the most popular, it also contains a secret few know about : the Seven Noses of Soho treasure hunt. These noses jutting out of walls in unexpected places are not all easy to find, but they’re supposed to bring good luck to those able to spot all seven of them. I’m still missing one, so that might be why I keep loosing my keys.''At Night''I love the London nights, whether it’s in the (relative) warmth of summer or in the winter with the Christmas lights all around. The nightlife is always booming, and the best district to enjoy it with the locals is''Shoreditch''.\xa0(Need a place to stay? check out apartment rental sites like AirBnB or''FG Properties'')''But there’s something else than drinking that makes the London nights magical for me, and that’s another kind of magic entirely : the theater magic. London is famous all around the world for its West End plays! Even for those not too much into theater, just believe me when I say it just takes one musical to get hooked.''To access the theater magic, go to the''Magic Booth''(it’s not an official name, just how I like to call it) on Leicester Square on the day that you hope to see a musical or play, and you’ll be able to get the best last minute prices for plays and musicals.''The''Shakespeare’s Globe''is also one of my favorite theaters, with 5£ seats available all year round if you book in advance, to see the famous playwright’s work in the building for which they were originally written for!''The''Secret Cinema'', in the summer months, is also a unique experience, screening movies in an immersive set and in a secret location. It’s typically nerdy, with films like Star Wars or Back to the Future, and I just love it.''To conclude, I wanted to introduce the amazing city dashes organized by''Fire Hazard''. In teams, you just run around the city at night looking for clues and escaping from some kind of monster.

After''Steve''showed photos of it to me on Google images, I was 100% down with the glacier hike.''Tours only started on Exploradores a few years ago, opening up a new revenue stream for the town of Puerto Rio Tranquilo and increasing tourism. In the grand scheme of things, even access to the town of Pto Rio Tranquilo is new. Prior to the construction of the''Carretera Austral''in the late ’80s, this was one of the most remote places on Earth.''A waterfall on the way to the glacier (but there were hundreds)''The groups are of about 20 people plus two guides, roaming in a single file across the glacier. In this case a guide is a necessity. They’re not only required in the national park,\xa0but also essential to not falling into a crevasse. They know the routes, and where to find the best photo opportunities.''Down south on Perito Moreno or Glacier Grey, the costs for a tour are about double (this one only cost around USD $60), and the photos I saw from those didn’t compare to those from our trek. Perhaps it’s a different kind of glacier or with more people, slightly tighter regulations, but I loved what I ended up seeing (and editing later that evening).''A shot from Steve’s drone above the glacier''The hike starts through a forest path for about an hour before coming to a glacier moraine. The thing about moraines is, like the glaciers, they’re constantly moving. This means there is no specific path and it’s a game of jumping from boulder to boulder and sometimes climbing with hands and feet. This lasts for a couple of hours as well.''Not to worry, though, because if you get thirsty you can always count on the fresh water coming directly from the glacier!''First, it’s rocky''And you’ve got to stay on your feet!''Eventually the rocks make way for ice. Crampons on, the feeling of walking on the ice is akin to that of the satisfying crunch from jumping on autumn leaves. It’s crisp and it crackles.''We were taught how to stay upright and how to climb up and down the slopes of the glacier. I felt that chances were good that nobody would fall into a crevasse, but given how steep some of the ups and downs are, I could have quite easily, at the very least, fallen flat on my face. I’m just that coordinated.''New ice caves are opening up and closing off all the time as the glacier recedes, as they are doing globally. Some of the ice waves and corners we crawled into and through are probably not even there anymore, and that was just a couple of months ago.''Ice waves in Patagonia''At some point during the day it hits you, while surrounded by such baby blue water, giant mountains that frame the glacier, also covered in glaciers and waterfalls of their own, that this is a special place.''There aren’t that many places in the world with that much ice, so few tourists, and so many adventurous options. No wonder Patagonia has long enthralled adventurists and sat so high on the bucket lists of so many travelers.''Yet so many of them pass this opportunity right up, because\xa0it’s not the easiest place to get to. So they go straight to the south instead and bypass most of Chilean Patagonia.''A really deep crevasse''You know what? That’s just fine with me, because the remoteness makes it all the more alluring.''But if you’re welling to go the distance, I hope that you make it there, too.''And while you’re at it, check these marble caves out!''Pretty darn cool''Do it Yourself:''Getting There: Take a tour from Puerto Rio Tranquilo. They depart daily and there are many companies where you can book in person. I went with and can recommend Explora Sur, which charged 45,000 CLP. The same company also runs boat tours to the marble caves which take off multiple times daily from town and last a couple of hours.''Wear: Something that isn’t baggy. I had wished my baggy pants had just been left at home because you can trip on them and go flying into a crevasse. Also bring hiking boots appropriate for all of the rocks, gloves, waterproof clothing, and sunscreen.''Sleep: Either in campgrounds if you have a tent, or at one of the guesthouses in town.

I’ve had commuters, families, locals, and even a retired English couple on holiday in a nice rental give me a ride. Everyone was respectful, kind, and genuinely just helping me out. It wasn’t a big deal, as hitchhiking is pretty common in Patagonia and much of Latin America in general.''The Carretera Austral, in particular, is a popular one for hitchhikers because it’s a rite of passage for young Chileans, and the other methods of getting around on this remote road are bicycle, a bus that departs only or twice per week, or one’s own car.''The road is roughly 1200 km (≈ 746 miles) and most of it is gravel. It has only existed for 28 years, connecting parts of Chile that were previously only accessible by boat, so the towns along the road are tiny.''Most people have heard of the famous Ruta 40 that runs through Argentinian Patagonia, but the real treat is along the Ruta 7.

A few people who walked into the road ahead of Steve and I got picked up and I was pretty much seething, but it may have worked out better in the end.''This is the view from Puyuhuapi''The first ride was with the family from Santiago retracing the dad’s trip from when he was 18. The second was from a couple of guys in a pickup truck that was full of bikes and motorbikes. We tried to fit but\xa0there just wasn’t enough room and after an hour of bike parts causing me pain every time we went over a bump, which was often on gravel, I had to call it quits.''Then after about two hours standing in heavy rain at the park entrance for the enchanted forest (bosque encantado), a young couple from Santiago came out and asked, “Are you the first in line?” There was nobody else hitchhiking, so we said yes and he replied, “well come on then!”''The awesome driver and his lady''That ride in the back of the pickup truck was beautiful, providing amazing sweeping views in every direction.

It’s the right thing to do.''But since I feel like I can be real\xa0with you,\xa0I admit that there were a few times over the course of the 2 weeks of hitchhiking\xa0when I really wanted to break this rule when I saw others who cut in front get picked up first.''please continue to love me.''Thankfully\xa0Steve was adamant that he didn’t want to play dirty and in the end he was right and a few times it benefitted us.

Hugo picked us up within a few minutes of hitchhiking, our fastest pickup yet, and at first asked questions that were a little unsettling, like how did we pay for traveling and was it expensive to stay in hospidajes along the road? At first I worried, for the first time ever, that taking the ride was a mistake.''Then the feeling\xa0completely changed when he started to pull over and announced that when he opened his hostel, which he was on the way to continue construction on that day, that he would offer tours to the hikes in the area and this was the trailhead of one of them.

The rest of the trip was relaxed, seeing cool things whenever he pulled over and\xa0feeling so lucky to have a driver who wanted to show us\xa0beautiful stops along the way.''The area from above (You can see this on the Cerro Castillo hike)''When we arrived in the town, let’s just say it was sleepy beyond belief. Here’s what my journal said that day:''March 15, 2016''Cerro Castillo’s a small town of only 600 people. Accommodation isn’t easy to come by here and most places we asked about are full, but there is one little market, ‘pension’ combination that has a room available. It’s essentially living in one of the rooms of a house where a family lives – a visiting granddaughter, an elderly couple who run the joint, and the road workers on the\xa0Carretera Austral.''Initially we came by to drop off our stuff and a warm and friendly\xa0woman\xa0with bright red, box-dyed hair said to come back in two hours, at 3pm. When we did, the bed wasn’t changed but her husband was just so cute and sweet I couldn’t even feign annoyance.''“Could you check again in an hour?” He smiled, “it’s just so much hard work!”''With that he plopped down in a lawn chair and opened up a Quilmes beer.''Like many of the local men atop horses and herding cattle, he wears a beret and a mustache. He’s a gaucho.''The view and drive into Villa Cerro Castillo''The room is an interesting one. In order to open the door, one must pull on the end of an old cell phone charging cable, which has been routed through a small hole drilled in the middle of the door and tied to the latch so that it’s possible to open from the outside. I suppose that when the latch broke who knows how long ago, this fix made the most sense.''In a place this remote, where onward from here the gravel road eventually comes to a dead end, they don’t get many chances to buy new furniture or materials for home improvements. It’s evident in the curve of the walls, rippled by water damage a good 20 or so years ago, most likely. Or the doorframe that is only as tall as I am (5’8), and we all laugh when they tell me to be careful as I pass through.''There isn’t any insulation and though it’s summer, it feels so much like winter here. The stove that provides heating is also where the kettles and the food go. The lady who runs the joint won’t let us clean the dishes we used, and even tends to the pasta we started cooking for us. It’s a rare opportunity to be right in someone’s home with them, and a treat to be with\xa0people who have\xa0such\xa0an open heart and warm hospitality.''Villa Cerro Castillo’s famous hike (it’s why we stopped there)''Since we are in South America and it would be a tragedy not to get more acquainted with the local wine, we bought a bottle of red. Our joy was short-lived when we realized that our POS multifunctional knife purchase doesn’t have a corkscrew, thus bringing us to\xa0an impasse\xa0for the evening.''Saving the day, her husband, the gaucho, smiled big and said he could open it. He had just the thing.''Then he produced a knife with a foot-long blade and started ramming it into the cork.''“This is my gaucho knife,” he proudly explained as he worked the knife further into the cork.''And who would question him? He wears the beret, there are paintings and tapestries of horses and gauchos all over the walls of his home, and he’s always sipping on some mate (a local herbal tea that is really strong in the caffeine department), at least until offered wine instead.''He triumphantly pulled out the cork and the evening was saved.''Laying in bed now, as the rain falls down outside, wet dogs running around, most likely stray but well taken care of regardless, I think to myself that this is exactly the kind of place where I love to be.''Nothing works in the way I understand it to normally, and it’s without any of comforts that most of my familiars at home would consider essential, like central heating, insulated walls, a bathroom with a shower curtain, among other things, but it’s still so cozy and comfortable. I feel like part of the family despite being a perfect stranger, and even half a world away from where I grew up, winds that sound like they’re 90km per hour whipping the walls outside, it feels great to be at home, even if it’s not my home.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Carretera Austral''In Two Places at Once: Walking from Villa O’Higgins, Chile to El Chaltén, Argentina''Thumbs Up!

Go for some sturdy shoes. This has been a PSA.''Oh and here’s another tip: Go early in the morning. Queulat national park doesn’t receive the tourists that the parks in the South do, but it still gets a lot by local standards and the viewing platform is small and the trails narrow.''You can camp in the park overnight if you wish, and if you’re heading south on the Carretera Austral anyways, this might not be a bad call. That way you can just continue south from there and you’re sure to see the glacier in the early AM before many visitors arrive.''When Steve and I were there, it was just us at first, going up the path and finally arriving at the viewpoint for the hanging glacier. It far, far exceeded my expectations.''Nothing I saw on Google images had done this place justice. It was mostly just phone photos that were poor quality, so seeing how magnificent Queulat actually\xa0was was quite the surprise, actually.''The lake accessed by another hike under the viewpoint''Once the viewpoint got crowded (mostly with Chileans on package tours), Steve and I headed down to the lake for another view and lunch (Side note: I am so glad that avocado is such a big part of Chilean cuisine. I basically had an avocado sandwich that day with a bit of Turkey), while a few people rented kayaks and took boat tours out to the moraine of the glacier.

I’ll be waiting here for you patiently.''We good? Aiiiight.''Let’s do this''As the sun rose on day two of the hitchhiking adventure, Steve and I figured that the early bird would get the worm so we readied ourselves\xa0to leave\xa0our ridiculously basic hospidaje, the kind of accommodation that is really common along the Carretera Austral where building materials and really, anything at all from civilization, is hard to come by.''I crouched under the dipping ceiling and stepped over the heads of the nails sticking up in the carpet and looked out the window. It was raining. Pouring, in fact. It would either prove to be an advantage by discouraging other hitchhikers or one long, wet, and frustrating day.''We walked out to the end of the town of La Junta where we’d made it to the previous day, stacked the bags on each other with the rain covers on so that they’d be dry enough, threw on our ski jackets we still had in our packs from''Austria'', and stuck our thumbs up.''Not many cars came by. Those that did were either full or disinterested in picking up soaking wet passengers. We entertained ourselves by playing games like, “I see something yellow.”''Whenever a cyclist would bike by we’d cheer for him or her and they always smiled or even laughed, happy to have the encouragement.''The day trudged on and the rain never let up. We wondered if there was any possibility of catching a bus and took a stroll back into town for some lunch and to check the time tables. There wasn’t a bus going in our direction and there wouldn’t be until the next morning at 6am. We walked back to the curb and the wind and rain picked up.''The previous day it had been Steve who had to talk me out of giving up and that day, standing in the rain for the better part of six hours, it was my turn to keep the spirits up.''Just as we were discussing whether to give up or not, a 10-wheeler truck drove by and, given I didn’t see any room in the front and they never stop anyways, I didn’t lift my arm.''Then, to my astonishment, I saw the truck pull over to pick up a group of four girls 50 meters or so behind us. A pair of hands stuck out from the back of the truck and started pulling up their bags for them.''For real this is happening?! (Photo taken at the end after we got out)''“Oh my god, he’s picking them up!” I gasped to Steve. Then without another word I took off running, hoping to whatever powers that be that I would make it there before the truck took off again.''Now a rational person might think to themselves,''Hmm, riding in the back of a dirty-ass dump truck does not sound ideal'', and I would normally agree, but I was no longer rational at that point.''The driver was out and standing next to the door when I arrived.''“Dos personas mas por favor?” I stammered in broken Spanish, breathless. A middle-aged, very relaxed-looking Chilean man jovially smiled and nodded in approval back at me, as if to say,''well of course, why didn’t you ask when I passed you the first time?''I took off running back towards Steve, who grabbed two of the bags and met me halfway, then went back for the other two. The same pair of hands reached out from the top of the truck bed and pulled our bags in. Then Steve climbed up and I right after him.''I couldn’t believe what I saw in there. There were a good dozen or so other young people sitting together in a circle, all hitchhikers. They were mostly Chileans, a couple of Colombians, and a couple young Spaniards, all of whom were wet and a little dirty from the asphalt still inside of the truck, but smiling big and welcoming us with open arms.''The crew''We sat on our backpacks and, once Steve was satisfied that nothing was crushing his drone pack, settled in for the bumpy and hilarious ride.''There was a white tarp on top of the truck bed to cover us from the rain, and probably any authorities, because as a guy in the truck who spoke English pretty well confirmed, it was definitely not legal to carry passengers in the back of a truck in Chile.''I looked to my right and one of the Colombians was cradling a jumbo bottle of wine like a baby in his jacket. He took out two coffee cups with lids and poured them full of wine then started passing them around. Next thing I knew, someone took out a portable speaker and started playing Chilean reggae music.''The crew after the ride (I covered the driver’s face so he can’t get into trouble)''It was the absolute best afternoon ever. I mean honestly, how often do you find yourself in the middle of Patagonia, passing around wine with a bunch of people in a 10-wheeler truck?''We bid our friends goodbye and strapped on the backpacks once more to search out accommodation and just as we did, a couple of cyclists came by all smiles,''“Hey, you were the ones who cheered for us! Glad to see you made it.”''Upon seeing the town we’d arrived in, Puyuhuapi, I was very glad too. It was absolutely gorgeous and surrounded by national parks we’d explore over the next few days.''But that’s a story for another time.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Thumbs Up! The Start of the Patagonia Hitchhiking Adventure''The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Carretera Austral''HitchHiking in China: Adventures in Transportation''Hey fellow millennials of the interwebs, how’s it going?''A lot of you have been emailing me lately looking for advice. You say that you’re contemplating whether or not you should continue your schooling or working at a job that you don’t love. You say that you want to travel the world instead, and worry when nobody understands this desire that you have to go against the grain. They tell you that you’re being irresponsible.''When I get these emails, I stress a little bit. I don’t want to be the one to tell you to turn your life upside down at such a pivotal point in your life, but then again, what point in life doesn’t have the capacity to be pivotal?''You ask me what you should do,\xa0hoping for an answer so that the pull you feel in your heart that is taking you elsewhere can be justified. You’re looking for permission to feel the way that you do because nobody else is giving it to you.''The truth is,\xa0you already know the answer inside of you and you just need someone to tell you that it’s OK to want what you want. So\xa0here it goes:''It’s okay to want something different.''Celebrate it''It’s perfectly normal. The generations before have always pointed the finger and said the younger ones were being too radical. They say we only care about ourselves, act entitled, we’re selfish, and we have no idea what hard work is.''The uphill battle has been there for the next generation since the dawn of time. There were probably cavemen way back when who were super resistant to the wheel, saying the\xa0progress and change was bad for humanity.''So don’t worry if your parents don’t understand you because their parents didn’t understand them either, and so on.''The younger ones have\xa0always been dubbed some iteration of a “me” generation. To take it a bit further,''according to Joel Stein''in TIME, we’re the “Me, Me, Me” generation because we like to take photos of our food and prefer to\xa0document our lives than, I guess, do what our parents did?''But hang on a sec, there, Joel, because there’s a big difference this time: We’re\xa0not coming into a booming economy, we don’t have the same affordable access to education that our parents did, and the job market is pathetic. It’s a lot harder to argue that the traditional path is the right one to take when it has\xa0pretty much\xa0evaporated.''So if you’re reading this hoping for some solidarity, it’s right here. If you want to follow your nontraditional dreams, I’ll tell you how, but be forewarned: Chasing dreams is never simple nor easy. You didn’t want it to be easy anyways, right? The right amount of challenge is thrilling.''Ready to work for it? Read on.''Step One: Ask yourself who chose the path you’re on''choose the path less taken''I did a lot of things that I thought I was ‘supposed’ to do in my younger years. I went to college, racked up a little bit of debt because of it, got a solid job that perfect strangers could admire, signed a lease, and lived the American dream for a while.''I have no regrets because my university years were instrumental to the way that I think and operate now. I met my best friends there. I loved going to school. Some of you don’t feel that way about it, though, so ask yourself who you’re really doing it for.''For me, it started to feel all wrong after I entered\xa0the work force full time. I thought that the the things I was buying with the money I worked so hard for were supposed to bring me joy, but when they didn’t, I got disenchanted quickly. I felt like Chuck Palahniuk from''Fight Club''was talking directly to\xa0me when he said, “We’ve been all raised by television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars, but we won’t and we’re slowly learning that fact.”''My reality didn’t agree with me so I sought to change it, which led me to the next step:''Step Two: Make a plan''Make a plan''To be clear,\xa0working in corporate America is what got me here because without that experience I would not have the cash to have started traveling. You can’t always love what you’re doing 100% of the time in order to be successful at chasing your dream. Accept that now.''But you don’t have to have a job like that in order to save up. I have a friend who saved up $60k CAD over the course of just a year by working at a cell phone store, and have met plenty of people abroad who saved up by working service jobs. It’s all about hard work and sacrifice.''So no,\xa0I don’t think that you should quit school with only two semesters left before you finish your degree and buy a plane ticket with a credit card that you can’t pay off. Have patience, and make\xa0a solid plan for how you’ll save and what you’re going to do to make money on the road. It’s ok if you can’t take action immediately, but please don’t forget that it’s critical to be financially secure before taking a leap of faith.''Step Three: Own your decision''Dear millennials, Own it!''Even though it seems like funding the adventure should be the hard part, it’s not. For most people, the hard part will come when they have to tell everyone they love that they’re going against the norm. Your friends and family might put the full court press on you, trying to talk you out of it, bringing up every scary scenario they can so that you don’t end up going.''But you’re an adult. This is your life, and your decisions are yours. As long as you’re financially independent and well-prepared, then it’s up to you what you do, really. There will be a lot of fears and naysayers, but thankfully the longer and more successful your travels, the less weight they’ll carry and the more people will see that this lifestyle is possible.''Remember, the new generation is always on the forefront, doing things that have never been done before. Let’s make this the generation that understands each other better, takes the time to learn about other cultures, and instead of fear, embraces adventure and openness.''Need a little more help getting there?

Since the road is mostly just gravel and busses are intermittent at best, to do it right takes about two weeks and\xa0unless you take a car down the road, you’re hitchhiking.''All suited up and ready to go (yes those are cookies in my backpack pocket)''Construction of the Carretera Austral highway began in 1976. Then-Dictator Augusto Pinochet ordered the Chilean Army to build the road in order to connect remote communities that were difficult to reach by land. More than 10,000 soldiers to work in its construction, many of whom lost their lives during their effort.''The highway opened to traffic in 1988, and\xa0has been under construction ever since. Some parts are paved but most of the road is gravel.''What I loved about the Carretera Austral was the lack of foreign tourists. There were a few, but the route is much more famous and popular with young Chilenos who try to get as far as they can go by\xa0the grace of strangers over the course of their summer holidays. For many of them, it’s a pilgrimage that defines their youth.''For me, it would define my time in Patagonia and my impression of Chilean people.''The first time I tried hitchhiking\xa0in''Costa Rica'', I was scared shitless and worried I’d made a huge mistake, but all turned out well and I felt a warmth in met I’d never felt before when I alighted from the car. There’s something so humbling and reassuring about hitchhiking.''Where it all began''I know that if\xa0you’ve never done it before this might sound absolutely crazy, but there is nothing I can think of that has let me into the culture or has made me feel as confident in the good of people as much as openly asking for help on the side of the road and a perfect stranger making the snap decision to give it to\xa0me has.''South America is the fifth continent\xa0I’ve hitchhiked on. In Asia, I went through''two provinces in China''almost exclusively using my thumb and in''Mozambique''in Africa it was one of the safer ways to get around, believe it or not.''I embarked on\xa0this journey of two weeks and roughly 1000 kilometers (≈621 miles) with Steve who had''already done it once in the reverse''from South to North three years prior. This time, he returned with the goal of making a documentary out of the experience, and I had a goal of seeing as much of beautiful Patagonia as possible.''Would you give me a lift?''Between the two of us I estimated that we had roughly $10,000 worth of equipment including two computers, two brand new\xa0cameras, GoPros, a drone, and basically our whole lives packed into two big backpacks and two small ones. I’ve always viewed hitchhiking as a way of displaying one’s blind trust in the goodness of humanity and this was yet another test of the good in people. Why did we risk it? Because that was the entire point.''We started with a few bus rides and ferry combinations from''Bariloche''to Puerto Montt in Chile. We boarded an early morning bus from there to\xa0Chaitén, a town that was mostly destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 2008. While everyone survived, as the town was evacuated in time, the evidence is still everywhere from the beach covered in volcanic ash to the houses still partially buried by the mud and debris.''What remains''However it was peaceful and quiet in a way that would come to define the entire Carretera Austral, a road connecting tiny villages, simple homes, welcoming and curious people, and the least-known parts of Patagonia and South America in general.''Standing on the road outside of town the next morning, It didn’t take long for the first ride to come. It was a local restaurant owner named Christian who was on his way to Futaleufú, a rafting town a few hours off of the Carretera Austral. He was a young man of few words but with a handsome\xa0smile and a love for\xa0top 40 music. He dropped us at the junction\xa0between his turnoff and ours and immediately my heart sank.''“Uh oh, competition,” Steve said as we surveyed the situation. There were already tons of hitchhikers on the road.''On the north end of the\xa0Carretera Austral, you tend to see a lot of Chilenos, mainly from Santiago, starting out the trip and as you get farther south and even more rural, the numbers drop as they run out of time and have to return home. This\xa0part\xa0was the most crowded we would encounter.''We walked several hundred meters to what looked like no-man’s land. There was a tiny town nearby for snacks and food but otherwise, it\xa0was just a hot day with low prospects as car after car sped by us. I didn’t want to keep going. I wished so hard that day that there was a reliable way to go by bus.''Oh man, what a long day!''When lunchtime rolled around I went to the town to search out a place to eat. I looked around and saw tons more groups than there were before. They had just filled in spots along the road and we had been sitting like fools at the very end. We waited for 8 hours that day for a ride. As night was falling most of the others gave up. A bus that was too full to stop sped on by, as happened often on that route, the driver shrugging in apology. Steve and I figured we’d give it ten more minutes before setting up the tent and calling the day a loss.''Just then a car came by with only two spots in the back. He passed a group of three ahead of us and I held up two fingers anxiously. He returned the peace-sign two and pulled over just as night was falling.''It was an incredibly long day, but in the end, a successful one. All of the frustration and disappointment faded and was replaced with joy and excitement because we had made it a few more hours down the road.''It was the beginning of one of the craziest travel stories of my life. I could never have imagined the ridiculousness that would come in the following days. It would be my most incredible hitchhike yet.''If you want a little peek into how that day and the following ones were, here’s another episode of the video series we were there to put together.

The dry, barren landscape, known locally as “pampa,” morphed into a giant blue lake as the plane readied for touch down. I marveled at the sudden change in landscape, all googly eyed, when the plane started to shake violently, dipping from one end to the other, kind of like when you lose control of a car on a wet road. It was my first introduction to those infamously strong Patagonian winds, which pulled the wings of the plane like a marionette.''The crowd on the plane became increasingly alarmed, gasping and ‘dios mio!’ing louder with each pull and push. The plane landed with a thud and my heart jumped into my throat. We were in Patagonia, and had managed to get there in one piece.''What an introduction!''The town of Bariloche made me wonder if I’d left Europe at all. Reminiscent of Switzerland with names like ‘Edelweiss’ and alpine-style architecture, the town is known for chocolate and skiing in the winter months. It’s also known for settlement by''former Nazi war criminals''and maybe even Hitler himself, but in the local nature of sweeping that under the rug, we won’t talk about such things here.''Bariloche''I honestly didn’t like the town much.''Can you tell?''It was too touristy and crowded for me, but to its credit it\xa0does have some fantastic microbreweries and delicious chocolate (go to Rapa Nui and get the chocolate covered raspberries!).''Once I got out of the town to the surrounding natural areas, though, the magic happened.''Here were some\xa0of the best things to do around Bariloche:''Ruta de los Siete Lagos (Route of the Seven Lakes)''So clear and blue''The route of the seven lakes is a definite highlight of Bariloche. You pass through, you guessed it, seven different lakes in the area, all of which can be done either in a day or over a longer stretch of time if you want to stop and sleep in any of the little towns along the way.''Two lakes meet''There are tours that take you around the lakes, but what I thought was even better was the freedom of renting a car. I just hung around my hostel at dinner time and spoke to other travelers and it didn’t take long before meeting an Italian couple who had planned to go the following day and were happy to share a rental. It worked out to something like $25 per person and we rented the car by asking at the front desk of\xa0the hostel we were staying at.''A lovely viewpoint along the way''The sunset on the way back out''The color of the water is beautiful and so crystal clear! There are little beaches at some of the lakes that you can stop and swim in, go fishing in, and lounge around. Some are more crowded than others, but there’s one part that you can get almost to yourself if you park just before (or if leaving just after)''Pichi Traful Lake''which is down the 2km bumpy road. It’s so serene and clear. You’ll see a few cars pulled over which signals you’ve reached the right place.''Refugio Frey Hike''At the Cerro Catedral''This hike is all about giant orange boulders, lots of sun, and for those who like the world to be their jungle gym, a lot of fun as well.''If you want to hike to the Refugio Frey you have two options – you can either take the ski chair lift up from the Cerro Catedral ski resort or the forest path. For those who are particularly fit, skip the chair lift altogether and walk up from the very bottom.''The turn off point for Jakob or Frey''Personally I took the chair lift up. From there it was a really narrow\xa0and nerve-wracking 500 or so meters to the boulders on a narrow and gravely path. Then, I climbed up and over the boulders for a couple of hours and then back down them again to the refugio.''Climbing down after climbing up''For those who love climbing hand over foot on rocks, this will be tons of fun. For those with knee problems or fear of heights, opt for the forest path. If you want to do both, you can easily just take one path up and the other down like I did.''Just before reaching the refugio''The lovely lake (and the boulders I’d just climbed over)''Once you reach the refugio, you can stay the night or just keep going. This hike is easily doable in a day if you leave early enough in the morning, so chill for an hour or two, enjoy the lake, and watch the rock climbers, then head down into the forest to get back to the parking lot of the ski resort.''Refugio Otto Meiling and Cerro Tronador Hike''Looking up at the Cerro Tronador hanging glacier''This hike is beautiful and I’d rate it a medium as far as physical challenge due to the middle part of the trail called the a caracoles – a snaking and winding part of the trail that’s a bit steep – and the end which is quite rocky. It’s 18km each way, plus an extra km if you’d like to walk to the bottom of the hanging glacier to see the falls. This is highly recommended if you have time as it’s gorgeous.''The trail up''The first part of the hike is through trees and the second part is in the sun on the rocky top of the mountain. The refugio Otto Meiling offers up beds and food, though there are plenty of camping spots as well that you can elect to donate some money for or just free camp. Keep in mind there is a park entrance fee as well.''Snow in the summer (well, several thousand year old ice, actually)''The top of the mountain is incredibly beautiful, so leave some time to explore up near the glacier as well. Also, bring a very warm sleeping bag. Sleeping next to that glacier was one of the coldest nights of my life and not much actual sleeping happened.''The glacier''Refugio shot by my hiking buddy''Steve Haenisch''If you want to give it a try, buy a return bus ticket to Pampa Linda, the start of the trail, from the Club Andino in Barilcohe\xa0for $400 pesos return and if needed, rent gear from them as well. The busses leave at 8:30 in the morning and return in the afternoon. You also won’t need a map as the trail is obvious. Keep in mind that the busses run only in the summer season at the time of this writing, and the hike is considerably more difficult and even impassable in the winter months with ice and snow.''Cerro Campanario''The view point at Cerro Campanario''This famous viewpoint gives you an overhead view of the gorgeous lakes in the area of Bariloche. If you have a car, get over there for the sunrise. Since I didn’t have the rental anymore on a day suitable to catch a sunrise, I went for sunset instead. It’s easy to get there on the #20 bus, which leaves from the bus depot in town. In order to take this bus, you need to buy a card first in a convenience store in town.''You’ll want to get off on Ave. Bustillo which is 17km out of town. Ask the bus driver to point it out to you because it’s not necessarily marked. From there you can take a chair lift to the top or, what I did and would suggest, is just to walk up. It’s a steep trail and takes about 30 minutes to get to the top. Busses run until midnight coming back towards town.''Eat''The Antares Brewery''had some really good food and beer but like much of the town was a bit pricey, and La 10 Empanadas at Neumeyer and 20 de Febrero had really excellent, cheap empanadas which were great to take on the hikes.''Stay''Hostels aren’t a great value in Bariloche, I was sad to find. However''Penthouse 1004'', even though it looks like an hourly hotel from the outside, is actually a pretty nice hostel with a great view of the lake and city.

I left my bag with everything valuable in it on a seat across from Rene, a guy I’d known for a day or two, while I went to get some tea. I came back and he remarked that it was beautiful that I’d trusted him enough to leave my bag with him. After all, he was more or less a stranger.''I was surprised that he even noticed. There was no question in my mind about leaving my bag there. I never imagined he would run off with it or lift some cash while I was away.''Traveling in general has taught me to trust people. I’ve''hitchhiked with several thousands of dollars''worth of electronic equipment on me before and nothing bad happened, have given my debit card and pin number to a fellow traveler while be missioned to the ATM a full hour away to get some cash, and have paid for things for other travelers when their cards weren’t working and none of it came back to bite me. All of it worked out and people were kind and honest.''I recently''stated in interviews''that I believed that people are fundamentally good, and as though sealing my fate, had even written that''I’d never been robbed while traveling''in an article a few weeks prior.''Was never an issue before''Then during a May Day celebration in Berlin, about six hours after I’d landed from Buenos Aires, I got pick pocketed.''I wouldn’t even normally have been there, but I was trying to fight the jet lag so I went out against my better judgement.''The irony is not lost on me that I’ve traveled through ‘dangerous’ South America and even South Africa without any incidents and then as soon as I returned to my home base, was robbed.''Big crowds\xa0were dancing in the street just after dusk. There was awesome music playing and I kept exclaiming how wonderful of a reception it was to come back to a party that was ‘so Berlin.’ I had my wallet and phone in my cross-body purse and kept reaching for it to make sure that everything was fine. Then, when we were passing through a particularly thick crowd, I put my hand back again and felt, to my horror, that the zippers were open and my stuff was gone. It happened within five seconds. It could have happened to anyone in my group but it happened to me this time.''A happier time in Berlin''My unlocked iPhone and the money inside totaled about $1000, including my ID and all of my cards, but thankfully, not my passport. My travel insurance finished when I came back from South America, and therefore so did my coverage.''I thought back to the experiences of some of my friends in Berlin and it’s actually not surprising. My old roommate’s phone was stolen out of her purse on Christmas eve. Almost everyone has his/her bike stolen at some point (me included), and another friend was robbed of €500 while walking through a park at night. I guess I’m a real Berliner now?''An uncomfortable truth about Berlin is though this city is full of artists and hipsters, many of them are unemployed and struggling. This city is in debt by something like €80 million and needs to be bailed out by the other states in Germany each year. Per capita it is as''in-debt as Detroit''. Even more sobering,''one in eight people''here live below the poverty line. There isn’t much violent crime here but like most major European cities there is a ton of theft, and the thieves are really, really good.''The cost of replacing it all definitely sucks, but it’s just money. The time it took to speak with the bank and file police reports was even worse. I hate that kind of headache. But even\xa0that wasn’t the worst part of it. Not even close.''The worst part is how it made me feel about my fellow humans.''Look, I know pickpockets exist and I wasn’t blind to the fact that there is evil in the world prior to this. I’ve been robbed many times before, once even while I was at home in home in Santa Barbara and someone broke in.\xa0Im not\xa0naïve.''Cool you can just take this. go ahead.''I really liked leaving my bag with a stranger at a hostel and not thinking twice, though. I don’t want to go through the next few months or years, which is probably inevitable, being hyper vigilant and always looking around any time I’m in a crowd. I don’t want it to affect my opinion of Berlin, but\xa0I also don’t want to go through this again.''Today I rode my Airbnb host’s bike out to a breakfast joint in Queens during a long layover en route back home. I don’t have a phone right now so there was nothing to distract me as I sat at breakfast alone. The server came over and casually chatted with me and the people behind me at the tables all did so with each other, too.''“Don’t I know you from somewhere?”''“Which high school did you go to? NO WAY! What year did you graduate? You must know my cousin, Charlie.”''I smiled to myself as I drank my coffee. For a rare moment I could actually understand the conversation going on around me and the sense of community was beautiful. I didn’t have anything to take my focus away from what they were saying so I just listened, and found myself loving what I was hearing, loving the neighborhood, and finally feeling good again for the first time all week. A few people said ‘good morning’ to me on my ride back I just felt happy to be closer to home again, starting to trust that, even though bad eggs are everywhere, people really are fundamentally good.''Yep, of all places, Queens, New York restored that faith.''I’ll replace my lost items, the memory will slowly fade, and it’ll be alright again.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''The Hands Down Worst Travel Day Ever''Why I Prefer Solo Travel (And Probably Always Will)''Why Making a Five-Year Plan is a Waste of Time''In my annual reader survey I included a new optional section this year – one where you could ask me anything that you were curious about.

Ten years is a while!''2. “What are your thoughts on visiting the same place twice?”''I’d suggest going into it fully expecting that it will be different from when you were last there, but don’t let the fear that it may have changed hold you back if you really want to return. I’ve been back to''Pai''twice and South Africa once and I will probably always love those places.''3. “Are there any countries that you’d be afraid to travel to?”''India freaks me out. I do want to go, but I keep putting it off.'"4. “Do you ever doubt yourself? Do you ever reach a point of ‘what am I doing?'”"'Absolutely.''All the time''.''5. “Who’s the best person you’ve met whilst travelling?”''Can I pick more than one?''6. “Which country/trip made the most significant impact on your life today and why?”''Probably the first one I took by myself to Taiwan when I was 21 as a language student. It was really hard for me at first. I was so stressed out dealing with everything on my own – finding a place to live, opening a bank account, even just grocery shopping – that I wanted to come home early. My mom talked me off the ledge and urged me to stick it out for at least three months, and in the end I stayed for eight. I became so much more confident in myself as a result, and it opened up my eyes to other ways of living. I never got over my love for Asia after that. I firmly believe it’s the reason why I travel now. Had I never gone, I probably wouldn’t be doing this today.''7. “What are your favorite travel planning websites?”''For flights, I love''Google flights'',''kayak.com/expore'',''adioso'', and Southwest for domestic flights within the US.''For getting from point A to B, I love''Rome2Rio''and''WikiTravel''. In Southeast Asia, I find''Travelfish''is often helpful.''For destination-specific advice, I usually Google the destination plus the phrase “travel blog” and see who has written about it. I like blogs that are really in-depth, offer a lot of useful information, and who don’t do a lot of hand-held tour stuff.''8. “What are your favorite blogs right now?”''Waitbutwhy.com''for when I want to get really engrossed in a complex topic''thebloggess''when I just want to laugh''The Everywhereist''for when I want to laugh but also read something travel-related''I always enjoy the thoughtful posts by''LegalNomads''ZenPencils''is my favorite for a pick-me-up''I can get lost for hours on''Buzzfeed'', so I try to reserve that for when I have a lot of down time, which lately is almost never''9. “Do you ever feel like you need to be a representative for your country on the road, even if you don’t want to be?”''I feel responsible for being a good tourist. I treat the local people with respect and try to learn some of their language. I find if I treat people the way I want to be treated I have a much better time and at least don’t fit the “ugly American” mold. As for politics, if a fellow traveler tries to talk about American politics with me in a aggressive way, I just end the debate before it begins\xa0and say, “I don’t talk politics.” We all know that conversation will have no winners.''10. “Do you plan to go back to Southeast Asia?”''Yes, definitely. It’s where this whole adventure began and it is definitely in my plans for the near future.''11. “Does the world feel bigger or smaller to you after so many years of traveling?”''Both at the same time. My list of places I want to visit gets longer but I realize that we’re all more interconnected as human beings than I think most people who haven’t traveled realize.''Never stop exploring''On Solo Travel''12. “Do you notice female inequality when you travel solo? Do you get the same treatment and opportunities as male travellers?”''I definitely notice in a lot of countries I visit that women don’t have the same rights as men. I don’t enjoy having to cover up and sweat due to modesty beliefs in some countries while the guys get to wear tank tops and shorts. Yet while it sometimes feels unfair, there are benefits too. I find that as a solo female traveler locals take care of me more and\xa0I am shown a lot of kindness by people because they’re concerned for me being alone, even though they don’t need to be!''13. “How often does loneliness get to you?”''It hits at the strangest and most random times. Sometimes I’m all alone for too long, and sometimes I’m in a crowded room but it feels like the loneliest place in the world.''Traveling lows''can be pretty low, but the highs are equally high and I find that overall I spend more time''surrounded by good people''than by myself.''14. “Do you return home much?\xa0Do you miss your friends and family?”''I miss them a lot. For the first two years that I was traveling, I came home once per year over the summer but over the past year and a half I’ve gone back four times. I don’t like missing the holidays and I have a baby niece now who I want to see as much as possible.\xa0I’m always humbled by how amazing my friends are and, though I’m absent so much, they put a lot of effort into seeing me.''15. “What is something that you know now about traveling that you wish you knew before you started?”''That there is no such thing as an ideal lifestyle and everything has its pitfalls.''Sometimes, traveling sucks''and even though it seems glamorous, it’s still life with good days and bad days. Everything operates on the law of diminishing returns, except for passion fruit. I would never get tired of that.''16. “Have you ever been in a scary situation while traveling (ex. Personal Safety)? And if so how did you handle it?”''I was''groped in the dark in Nepal''just a few days after arriving there and it really freaked me out. I went to the police but they didn’t care. I didn’t have anyone around who I could talk to, so\xa0I went on Be My Travel Muse’s Facebook page and posted about\xa0what happened. Some people encouraged me to leave, but I’d planned a month in Nepal and by the next morning I felt alright again. I ended up staying and trekking the''Annapurna Circuit''and even attending a''coconut brawl''. I came to love Nepal and I’m glad I didn’t miss out by leaving early.''17. “Do you ever get sick of traveling?”''Honestly, I am a little sick of it right now. I have a lot planned for the two months ahead of me\xa0but I have found myself just wishing to be back in Europe (my ‘home’ at the moment). It’s not that I’m not grateful, it’s just that I’m exhausted. That’ll change after I’m in one place for a month, though. Then I find myself aching for the next adventure. The grass is always greener, eh?''18. “How do you reconcile multiple things you want that pull you in conflicting directions?”''All I can do is make a decision and confidently follow it through. It would be worse to get stuck in the land of ‘what ifs.’''On the Blog as a Business''19. “How do you finance your travels?”''Each year it’s different, but it has been a combination of $20k in savings from my old finance job, selling my car and taking on some freelance roles to finance the second year, and now, it’s mostly from affiliate link sales, book sales, a few freelance roles, and dedicated brand and destination partnerships.''20. “On average, how many hours do you work per week?”''It’s hard to draw the line between work and play. When I’m working on video projects like I did in''Finland''and''Austria'', all of the hours when I’m not sleeping are spent working. When I’m in California or Berlin and not on the road, I usually spend 14-16 hours per day, 7 days per week at my computer. It’s what I have to do to make up for the times that I go off the grid, which is really often for my blog in particular. If you focus on Europe or more developed countries and luxury travel you’re more likely to have an internet connection,\xa0but I tend to camp in the wilderness for weeks on end in Patagonia or spend a month in Mozambique where a connection is hard to come by. I have to binge-work to make up for that.''21.\xa0“Is it hard to run a business from abroad?”''Yes. You have to be very diligent and you need an internet connection, which as I pointed out above, isn’t always easy or even possible to come by.''22. “Do you have any methods/advice for focusing on your writing, especially when writing your books? I have a hard time sitting long enough to get into the flow.”''I cannot sleep or do anything else when I’m working on a book. I hate having unfinished projects and they tend to consume me. It’s probably not healthy but I actually don’t have problems getting into flow, but rather coming out of it. If you do have problems, however, I highly suggest reading the work of talented people whom you admire, even if, or especially if, it’s in a different genre.''23. “If you had to pick one thing that took your blog to the next level of income earning, what would you say it is?”''Getting good mentors and working with people who really understand this path as a business.''24. “Now that you have more paid work, is it harder to visit places without feeling like you have to ‘cover’ them and are ‘on the job’, instead of just enjoying the traveling?”''Honestly, no, because unless I have a lot of control over the itinerary and creative process, I don’t do press trips. I left my old job so that I could be my own boss and see the world, not to do a cookie-cutter tour.''As for whether I can just enjoy a place without feeling like I need to ‘cover’ it, I’ve always been a writer ever since I was young. I’m super right-brained and even before I had a blog I loved taking photos of my trips and writing about them in Facebook notes for my friends. This is how I enjoy my travels – by documenting them.''25. “How\xa0did you first get started with earning money from your blog, or what would you recommend to new bloggers as a first step toward earning money?”''I would recommend NOT trying to make money as a brand new blogger. You’ll sell out super early and kill your budding fan base. Build a meaningful readership first and then monetize. It’s a much longer-term and more sustainable way to do it.''26. “How can you stay motivated when you aren’t making any\xa0money\xa0from your blog?”''You have to love it. You have to be so into it that you’d do it even if nobody was reading it, which will likely be the case at first. I had to supplement my blog with freelance roles for a very long time before I could live off of it.''Think of it this way – most businesses are not profitable right away, or even after the first year, sometimes two. A blog is\xa0a business that needs investment in both time and money. Keep your eye on the prize and work ridiculously hard. If you don’t love it, it can’t last.''27. “What kind of income do you make and are you happy with it?”''Ah, the unavoidable income question! At first, I made nothing from my blog. That was OK because I had savings. Then I started to make enough to offset my travel costs. Then, things took off quickly, at least financially. I’ve had recent months when I made around $3k and months where I made closer to $10k. Am I happy with it? Not yet. I’m a businesswoman at heart and I want to keep growing.''Standing on Ireland, photographing Scotland''On Berlin''28. “How are you able to have residency in Berlin as an American citizen?”''I have what’s called a freelance/artist visa. If you’re from the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Korea, or Israel,\xa0can prove a livable\xa0income\xa0from freelancing contracts, have savings (not just that your parents transferred over temporarily so that you can get approved, because they’ll want to see a history), have a lot of patience for bureaucracy, and are willing to pay taxes in Germany, then\xa0it’s possible for you to get one, too.''29. “Do you think you’ll settle down in Berlin and really make it your home base?”''I was just approved for two more years under my visa so yes, I’d like to finally get my very own place and maybe even buy furniture. It gives me the anxiety shakes to think about something that permanent, though!''30.\xa0“Which district is your favorite in Berlin and why?”''Kreuzberg because I love all of the food, art, and funky hipster residents.''In Kreuzberg''On Settling Down and the Future''31. “Do you ever think about quitting what you’re doing and having a home? A place you can return to?”''I think about it but I don’t see the need to quit it all right now. I like what I’m doing and I hope that traveling is always a part of my life. It makes certain things a lot harder and maybe in time I’ll have to slow down, but I hope to never stop completely. A home sounds good, maybe 3 or 4 of them would be even better so that I don’t have to pick one place (See? I’m impossible).''Have a question that wasn’t covered here?

Whatever, doesn’t matter, we’d find some fjords and sail the''shit''out of them and it would be glorious.

I reasoned that until I was ready to live a more sedentary lifestyle, this would be a recurring problem and I just needed to live my best life to find happiness. It wouldn’t come from someone else.''Then at the time that I needed it the most, I had an epiphany that was years in the making that''I was finally enough''.''God, that felt so good.

I worried that I’d gone too extreme in the other direction.''Have I become someone who can’t let others in? Did I get too selfish to share anything or make any concessions?

I mean, I’ve been doing it for almost four years now so aren’t I supposed to share it at some point?''Do I have to share? I never got used to the idea of sharing chocolate, for example, and am frankly way happier just not sharing. I think that everyone should just get their own and not ask to try mine. I’m afraid sharing travel plans might fall into that bucket too and if it does I fear I’m doomed.''I think the key to happiness, at least for me, is to build something. Not just a business, not just a relationship, but a life that I can be proud of. Sometimes I am distracted enough from these thoughts by the adventure to forget that, but I’m not sure that constantly running is the answer. It can be part of the voyage, but it can’t be the whole course (I’m sorry I’m really not letting go of the metaphors here). I still don’t know how to make others fit into that scenario but I think I have to be a grown up now and try.''…And then sometimes I think that maybe on a Tuesday, I’ll just ride my bike east, as far as my legs will take me, then when I’m tired I’ll lay in the grass and stare up at the clouds, picking out fluffy animals until the sky turns black and they become constellations, then it’ll be time to take the train home, and maybe it’ll be exactly what I needed.

Maybe you’re worried that being alone will make you\xa0a target, your\xa0friends and family are telling you that you’re being irresponsible by going out into this big and scary world on your own, or your own inner-voice is holding you back with visions of worst-case scenarios.''Well screw all of that!''I’ve traveled for over three years now, almost exclusively by myself, and even in countries that are considered ‘dangerous’, with almost no issues whatsoever. What’s my secret? I\xa0believe that traveling alone has actually''helped''me stay safe. Why? My intuition is sharper, I am more aware of my surroundings because there’s nobody distracting me, and when locals see me, a girl on her own, they are more likely to want to help me than harm me.''The truth is, you already have the skills you need to stay safe when you travel. They’re the same skills you use at home to stay safe. But you don’t have to take my word alone for it. I asked 30 other solo female travelers to give me their best safety tips for traveling alone, and this is what they said:''Trust Your Gut''Trust yourself''1. “Politeness is never more important than safety. While the world would be a better place if everyone was thoughtful and kind, sometimes people – especially women – let courtesy override our gut instincts because we don’t want to be rude or be told we’re “overreacting.” But we should always trust our intuition, stop worrying about what other people think, be nice when it’s warranted, and choose safety when it’s not.” – Katie,''Domestiphobia''2. “It’s SO important to trust your instincts. If they tell you something is off, it probably is. And at the same time, if they\xa0tell you it’s all good, it probably is. It’s never let me down, ever.” – Milou,''Explorista''3. If you’re couchsurfing and the situation feels uncomfortable, just leave! Aleah from''Solitary Wanderer''adds, “make sure you have alternate accommodation in mind. Print out or write down the addresses of nearest hostels so you know you have somewhere to go if your arrangements go south.”''4. Be open to positivity and don’t assume everyone is out to get you. As Dyanne from''TravelinLass''says, “I honestly rarely even think about ‘safety’ per se as I find most all folks friendly and helpful and not out to somehow harm me. Such harm can come via walking down the street of my home town after dark, and I see little difference if I’m backpacking across South Africa (yes, even in -OMG-''Johannesburg''), or skipping around Egypt.”''Stay Aware and Be Less of a Target''Just\xa0do it!''5. “One of my favorites: Conceal cash by rolling it up tightly and sticking it in an empty tampon applicator (unused!!). Slide it back into the wrapper and you’re set. Not many pickpockets will try to steal a tampon from your pocket!” – Sonja, Breadcrumbs Guide''6. Sofie from''Wonderful Wanderings''adds, “Don’t flaunt your valuables too much” which should seem obvious, but you’d be surprised how many people I see with their phones out on city streets or wearing jewelry when they travel! Just keep it hidden or at home. You don’t need to wear expensive rings and earrings when you travel.''7. “I wouldn’t listen to music with earbuds in while walking around in a city. It makes you less aware of your surroundings and also usually signifies to a would-be mugger that you probably have a smart phone in your pocket.” – Eva,''Eva Explores''8. I’m a big advocate of walking with your back straight and your head held high, and looking people right in the eye when they address you. As Abi from''Inside the Travel Lab''jokes, “Learn to walk like a man.”''9. “Make sure you know of popular scams and problem areas within the city/region where you’re planning to travel. This isn’t to scare yourself silly before you start traveling, but rather just to be more aware of\xa0the place you’re heading to.” – Kasha,''Lines of Escape''10. “Mind the booze. It is ok to have a couple of drinks but getting drunk in a foreign and unknown place could put you in danger and get you lost.” – Inma,''A World to Travel''11. “Dressing appropriately can save you a lot of trouble, research about appropriate clothing for women wherever you go. Areas that are\xa0hot and humid are\xa0normally more comfortable in\xa0shorts and sleeveless tops, but it may not be suitable for certain traditions, cultures, and locations.” –''Lyndsay Cabildo''12. When taking a taxi, keep your stuff with you in the back seat so that you retain control over when you can get out. It can be useful\xa0if the cab is taking a longer route, tries to overcharge you, or if things feel uncomfortable. As Stacey from''One Travels Far''adds, “I now put my bag in the back seat with me, and not the trunk so that if I need to jump out quickly I can.”''Talk to Locals''Make local friends''13. “I look for walking tours whenever I’ve arrived in a new destination while traveling solo. Walking tours give me the lay of the city, and help me find my way around without getting lost the first time. (Because otherwise, I ALWAYS manage to get lost.) Tour guides will usually point out any areas you might want to steer clear of, and I feel more confident about finding my own way around the city after being led by an expert.” – Britany,''Travel Write Away''14. Combine fun and safety with\xa0this tip from Kristin of''Souvenir Finder'': “I love taking a ballet class at a local dance school to meet locals (you could do the same with a yoga or other class).” Locals can give you a great idea of where to go and what to avoid, plus, if they show you around that’s even better!''15. Do you already have connections in the country? Ask around on Facebook or ask locals. As Eva from''Trevallog''says, “When I was traveling in New Delhi alone, I asked a Tibetan friend whether he knew anyone in the town who I could travel together with. It turns out that he has a nephew who was enjoying school holiday and could accompany me to explore New Delhi the way locals do. I suggest to solo female travelers who are planning to travel to cities perceived as dangerous, to look around at their friends to see if they have any connections to local citizen at the destination city.”''16. “From my experience, women look after women, which is heartwarming. I travel solo, and local women are often really helpful.\xa0When I meet these women, I’m no longer alone.” – Teresa,''Independent Travel Help''Transit Safely''Photo of''@Stephbetravel''by''@PauloDelValle''17. “If I’m traveling solo after dark, I’ll often walk relatively close to a couple or a family. Usually, if I shoot them a smile, they’ll see that I’m not stalking them, but instead looking to walk with people. You’re less of a target if you’re by other people. If you ever do feel like you’re bringing followed, pop into the nearest restaurant or hotel. These usually have someone who speaks English and they’re more than happy to help.” – Stephanie,''Travel Break''18. Another tip that came up several times is knowing when to splurge and when to save. After a bad experience in Hong Kong, Shing from''The Culture Map''says, “Don’t be a cheapskate is my new motto after spending a night in [a seedy place]\xa0alone.”''19. This counts for taxis, too. Personally, I always use Uber (If you want to try it, you can''get your first ride free here'') when I’m in South Africa or a country where\xa0taxis are often controlled by gangsters. The app tracks the driver and\xa0you, keeping both of your information in the system. Even better, the payment is done through the app via credit card so no money is exchanged. As Becky from''The Girl and Globe''adds, “Travel budgets are a good thing, but be willing to ‘splurge’ when it relates to your safety. Pay for taxis at night instead of walking alone.”''20. Another good taxi tip\xa0if you don’t have a SIM card to use Uber is to “take the driver who is least interested or maybe even sleeping. Chances are lower that\xa0he/she will have malacious plans!” – Manouk,''Bunch of Backpackers''21. “Avoid traveling by train/bus/taxi by night if possible. Arrange to arrive at a new location in the light of day. Not only will you feel more at ease and be able to be more aware of your surroundings but there will also be more people around, giving you a more secure feeling.” – Cailin,''Travel Yourself''22. “I always grab the business card or ask front desk/concierge to write down the name, address, and phone number of my accommodation. That way if I get lost or am in a cab and can’t communicate with a driver, I can hand it to them and I can get back home.” – Arnette,''RTW Girl''Bring These With You''One of my PacSafe camera backpacks''23. “Carry decoy money in a dummy wallet. Keeping most of your cash in your bra/money belt/wherever is great, but if someone wants cash from you and you have nothing to hand them, they could get angry or even violent. I always keep a few small bills in my wallet just in case, and the bigger bills elsewhere.” – Rease,''Indecisive Traveler''24. In many countries, such as most of Europe, carrying mace or pepper spray is considered a concealed weapon. To get around this, I’d suggest using mosquito spray instead, or, as Lucy from''WanderLuce''suggests, “Use a miniature hairspray as a sneaky pepper spray replacement.” All of those hurt when they get into someone’s eyes.''25. “Most crimes are crimes of opportunity so its really all about putting yourself in the ‘too hard’ basket. Hence, I carry a personal safety alarm (''the vigilante one'') in my coat pocket that gives off a hell of a sound if I were to pull it.” – Britt, Roam to Wonder''26. “Invest in an''alarm door stop''(only like $15) that both slows someone in opening your door and also sounds an alarm when someone is trying to open it.” – Stephanie,''Quarter Life Epiphany''27. “I put a flashlight in my shoe. If there’s ever an emergency at night I worry I’d forget\xa0a flashlight- but I’d always put my shoes on!” – Leyla,''Women on the Road''28. Here’s MY biggest tip: Bring slash proof, RFID-blocking, and locking baggage with you. I religiously use my''PacSafe cross-body\xa0bag''and''wire mesh bag protector''and to date, knock on wood, have never had anything notable stolen. No method is completely fail-proof, but by using items like these, I make myself the most difficult and annoying person in the guest house or on the street to rob.''Stay Connected''Let them know where you are''29. “While you don’t have to check in with family or friends every day, it can be a good idea to regularly update some form of social media while on the road. Whether it’s Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or even Foursquare/Swarm, these digital breadcrumbs can give peace of mind to others that you’re safe, wherever you are” – Edna,''Expat Edna''30. “Let others know of your travel plans. I email people a copy of my itinerary and let them know if I change it.” – Valen,''Travel Scamming''Most Importantly, Enjoy It''31. “Sometimes you need to be alone. To get some peace, to get space to think\xa0and to be at peace with the world and oneself. And sometimes this is only possible when there are no other people around, when you have time to talk to yourself, listen to yourself and leave go of all the hectic and stress of every day life. Enjoy this time. Take your time and do whatever YOU want. Go for a walk (in the daytime) just by yourself, sit in a café, go in a museum or do something adventurous. It can be anything. And try also not to speak to anyone. Just yourself. You will see that you actually enjoy your own company way more than you would have expected.” – Yvonne,''Just Travelous''I hope these safety tips from these solo female travel experts help you stay safe and confident, and if you ever need a little encouragement, just remember how many women are out there traveling alone, and having a fabulous time doing it!''READ NEXT:''How to quell your parent’s fears about your solo travel''The Solo Female Travel Guidebook''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Common Solo Female Travel Concerns and Solutions''An Even Better Solo Female Travel Guidebook''The 13 Best Places in the USA for Solo Travelers''Remember back when I''interviewed\xa0Réka Kaponay'', the teenage girl who has been traveling the world nonstop since she was 10? That was a pretty awesome interview that really resonated with you guys, and I welcomed more people to reach out with their extraordinary travel stories as a result.''Recently, Gail Jessen reached out to me to tell me about her experience traveling with Hashimoto’s, an autoimmune disease, and why traveling has helped her\xa0to heal.''She started out conventionally like many of us, myself included, have. She built her career in higher education over the past\xa015 years\xa0she\xa0climbed the career ladder, bought a condo, and took one\xa0vacation a year. In time the stress of a full time job and pursuing additional advanced degrees simultaneously took a toll on her health, which was the catalyst that pushed her to start traveling. Here’s the experience in Gail’s own words:''What was the series of events that led to you deciding to quit your old job?''The lovely Gail''Gail: I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.''I definitely got stuck in the nonsense of society’s “shoulds.” There are many, especially for women, but just one example is that, “a responsible girl wouldn’t quit her job to backpack around the world” or, “It’s not safe for women to travel alone.” It’s perceived as indulgent, and even dangerous, which is bogus.''My previous life was fundamentally misaligned with\xa0my core self. I was working so hard and so fast at a life that didn’t light me up. Eventually all of that pushing pushed my body over the edge. At the peak of it all I was chronically fatigued, riddled with anxiety, and easily 100 pounds overweight. Eventually I was diagnosed with''Hashimoto’s'', an autoimmune disease that attacks the thyroid. My adrenals were on the brink of failure. I’d had enough. It was time to be brave.''For a lot of people, something catastrophic often happens to make them decide to make a big life change. How did something negative contribute to an experience that is now positive for you?''Keeping positive''Gail: When my doctor turned to face me with lab reports in one hand and her other hand on the thyroid in her throat, she said to me, “Your body is attacking itself.” She started talking about Hashimoto’s, which sounded like sushi to me, and I was barely hearing her. It washed over me so clearly, looking at the hand on her throat: I wasn’t living how I really wanted to. My body was attacking itself to get my attention, to get me to speak up, to get me to create a life that would heal me.''Hashimoto’s is the worst and the best thing that’s ever happened to me. My diagnosis was the proverbial line in the sand. Within one year I quit my job, started my coaching business online, lost 102 lbs, sold all my stuff, rented out my condo, moved into a backpack, and booked a one-way ticket to Bali. Hearing those words from my doctor was like rocket fuel. It was my permission slip.''What’s the best part about traveling?''Gail in\xa0Indonesia''Gail: Hands down the best part of traveling is the freedom. Nothing compares to the expansive feeling of arriving in a new place where no one knows you, no one has any expectations of who you are, and your schedule is your own to craft and enjoy. Granted, I’m working online as I travel, but again, the freedom that comes from being an entrepreneur and setting your own schedule is so beautiful.''The other element I love so much is that travel feeds my endless curiosity. To feel truly engaged with life I need novelty. I need to be challenged. I need to not speak the language and still manage to take care of myself and my needs. It takes a curious personality to be excited instead of''frustrated by all the newness''travel throws at you. For me that novelty is everything.''Is it ever difficult to travel with an illness? How are you managing to keep going?''Living life to the fullest''Gail: Traveling with a chronic health condition means I carry a second bag full of my pills. I travel with 10 different prescriptions and supplements to mange my health. I’m typically carrying upwards of eight months of all those meds at a time, so that’s a massive consideration. I carry a letter from my doctor with all those pills to get me safely and legally through Customs & Border Patrol checkpoints.''I manage non-negotiable food allergies in cuisines over the world and really miss my unrestricted foodie days. I also need to travel at a pace that supports my adrenals healing and helps regulate the energy my thyroid is capable of on any given day. Gone are the days when I’d blast through seven European countries in as many days riding twice that number of trains.''My Hashimoto’s is not yet in remission, but I absolutely know that travel is healing me. In fact, travel actually supports the healthy lifestyle that I could never manage in the grind back home. My health is lightyears better on the road than it is at home. I’m more active, my food is fresh and clean, I sleep well, and I’m in total control of my own schedule to regulate stress.''What has traveling taught you?''Biking in Bali''Gail: I’ve come to understand my non-negotiables and how to advocate for myself. One major reason I wanted to travel was because my previous life was so excessive. For me to go from a very comfortable life in the states (that I very much enjoyed) to realizing I don’t even need hot water to function is a fundamental reset. I’m definitely happier for it.''The most important non-negotiable that travel taught me is that my health is my number one priority. Never in my previous life did I realize how critical our health is to our happiness. I was totally disconnected from that. Backpacking with your own two legs around the world is a mind-bending experience. I’ve come to realize how capable I really am. I can even be a bit of a badass! I realized this while\xa0standing on top of a mountain in Bali looking at 360 degrees of terraced rice fields.''Nothing feels insurmountable at this point. Traveling solo in particular is such a deep, intense learning experience. You learn to trust yourself without apology.''What do you want to say to others whose health might be keeping them from seeing the world?''Gail in Bali''Gail: If you’re a traveler, a gypsy, a wandering soul — whatever you want to call it– then you know it. The longer you ignore it, the more misaligned\xa0you’ll become. Don’t underestimate the enjoyment of even a quick Saturday road trip to an interesting spot near your home. If the time ever comes to completely recalibrate your life and live out of a 46L backpack, then you’ll know.''I also\xa0believe\xa0that anything’s possible. When I was at the peak of my illness and on a medical leave from work, it was an epic adventure to walk one block to the grocery store and one block home. It was all my body could do for the entire day. I had to let that feel adventurous. I had to redefine what adventure meant to me. Step by step, and motivated by my dream to travel, I reclaimed my health so I could pull it off.''Though\xa0I’m not a doctor and I can’t possibly know each person’s\xa0unique situation, I hope that anyone who resonates with even a piece of my story will understand that doing what you love will heal you. At the very least it will support your journey back to health. That is travel for me.''You can find more about Gail’s story on her blog,''A Series of Adventures''.''For more stories from solo female travelers like Gail, check out the solo female travel guide!''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''The Dr. Seuss Guide to Traveling and Following Your Dreams''How Traveling Solo Healed My Heartbreak''Solo Female Travel Stories: Courtney the Traveling Stylist''The following is a guest post about some of the best places to eat cheap and delicious food in Berlin, Germany. As much as I love food, I’m not great at photographing it, mostly because I eat half of it before I think to take a photo. I’m not the best at describing it, either, but Cam is! Cam focuses on street food around Europe, helping to make an otherwise expensive part of the world more reachable for the masses. The following are his favorite places to find Berlin’s best street food, which I agree with as a''resident of the city''!''I remember walking through the streets of Berlin years ago admiring the''interesting graffiti''and alcoves while\xa0looking\xa0for hidden bars and new restaurants. It was as if entire blocks smelled of grilled sausages or falafel frying nearby. After seeing how so\xa0many\xa0food trucks, street food kiosks and little restaurants adorned the city it was no wonder why delicious smells seemed to come\xa0from\xa0everywhere.''Any stretch of Berlin could yield places to try new gyros, falafel, dumplings, burgers, sausages, and more. For a street food fanatic like me, I didn’t know where to start on this most recent trip. I asked locals, read reviews and wandered endlessly looking for what I thought might be the best options available.''Though there is much more to explore in\xa0this culinary playground, I found what I believe to be some of Berlin’s best street food options. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.''Burgermeister in Kreuzberg''Bergermeister,\xa0Oberbaumstraße 8 10997 Berlin''With busy\xa0roads on either side, and sitting underneath a third, you can’t really get more ‘street’ food than this.''Burgermeister''is located in what looks like a large shipping container in Kreuzberg.''Juicy burger styles include the bar-b-q, chili cheeseburger, mushroom burger, a tofuburger and more. They’ll likely have a line when you visit but it will be for good reason.''The\xa0Bar-B-Q Burger, €4.50''I went with the Bar-B-Q Burger (€4.50) which included bacon, caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato and special sauce. I also added cheese. The patty was juicy and melted in my mouth. The bacon and onions were cooked perfectly and added a nice smoky flavor. The veggies were sliced then and the bun was nicely toasted.''I quickly realized it was one of the best burgers I’ve ever had. I was tempted to try the fries with cheese or chili but knew I had so much more street food to try that night. Still, the fries looked really good. I look forward to giving them a try next time.''Street Food Thursday at Markethalle Neun''Street Food Thursday,\xa0Eisenbahnstraße 42-43, 10997 Berlin''Every Thursday night at''Markthalle Neun''(Market Hall Nine), around 20-30 street food vendors gather here from 5-10 p.m. Named simply''Street Food Thursday'', this event allows diners\xa0to try a number of options as well as local beer and wine. Each of the vendors has their\xa0own unique culinary focus and style.''Everyone was very friendly and helpful in describing what they do and how they prepare their food. It got very busy by 6 p.m. so make sure to get here early!''(''Note from Kristin:''They also have a breakfast market there once per month which is equally delicious!)''Pork Belly Gua Bao, €6''Bao Kitchen''As I arrived\xa0at Street Food Thursday just before they opened,''Bao Kitchen''‘s gua bao buns immediately stood out. Bao offered pork belly, pulled pork and shredded chicken. I talked to them as they opened and they were\xa0excited about what they were preparing. My mind went to the pork belly option and when I asked them, that’s what they recommended.''Once ready, I watched as they reached into a wooden case positioned over boiling water and pulled out a fresh bun that was still steaming hot. They folded it and added a smear of sriracha. Then some finely diced cabbage and onion that had been slow cooked was spooned on top. Finally they added a few pieces of pork belly, a reduction of the sauce the pork was cooked in and some cilantro. They asked if I would like some slivers\xa0of spicy red pepper, as well as some crushed peanuts. I agreed to both.''The meat was juicy and flavorful. The sauces added a richness and hint of spice while the herbs added an element of freshness. I loved the way the peanuts stood out with the extra crunch through the soft and tender textures of the rest of the dish. It was very well done overall. For about €6 I highly recommend giving these a try.''Shared seating at Street Food Thursday''There are a number of other vendors including:''Mogg:''Pastrami sandwiches''Fräulein Kimchi:''Korean tacos''Glut & Späne:''Smoked fish''Craft beer, wine & cocktails''Additional options such as\xa0Malaysian dumplings, Egyptian food, grilled sausages, burgers, ice cream and more!''Unfortunately I didn’t have the time or\xa0a larger stomach to enjoy more of Street Food Thursday but I will be back!''Curry 36, Locations throughout Berlin''Currywurst is one of the undisputed kings of Berlin street food. To find it, I was told by locals that''Curry 36''was where I needed to go. Offered with or without the sausage casing, I was told to order without. After a few rides on the subway and a quick walk, we found their location at Mehringdamm 36.''Though there was a long line, it moved quickly. Smells of curry and roasting meats wafted all around us and prepared me for what I would experience.''I ordered and made a mistake in my broken German, forgetting to specify no sausage skin. My friend caught the\xa0error\xa0and managed to get the kitchen’s attention. Minor\xa0disaster averted.\xa0After my mix-up, they\xa0grabbed my skinless sausage off the grill, sliced it up, added some sauce and dusted it with curry powder.''Currywurst isn’t that visually impressive. It looks like a large sausage covered in ketchup. This understated appearance is deceiving.''Currywurst at Curry 36, €2''It’s crazy\xa0how simple the currywurst appears versus how great it tastes. This little dish is fantastic! The sausage is fresh and flavorful, complemented well by the simple but well seasoned sauce and a dusting of curry powder. For only €2 this is a great deal. You can also order it with fries and a drink for a few dollars more. Highly recommended. Find Curry 36 at one of their many locations throughout Berlin.''The line at Mustafa’s''Mustafa’s Gemüse Kebap,\xa0Mehringdamm 32, 10961 Berlin''Not far from Curry 36 is another local favorite called''Mustafa’s Gemüse Kebap''. With a line that usually takes around\xa030 minutes to get through at lunch time, this\xa0is a good\xa0indicator of quality street food in Berlin.''As I\xa0neared the front of the line one of the largest vertical rotisseries of chicken I\xa0had ever seen came into view. It may have been larger than all the ones I saw during my time in Turkey and Greece. They also had huge mounds of cabbage, onions and other vegetables. These guys were prepared to deal with a high volume of traffic.''Look at all that meat!''I ordered my chicken in a durum wrap with all the vegetables, hummus and spicy sauces. Though busy, these guys were kind and happy enough to allow me to snap off a photo of them making the durum wrap.''The good guys at Mustafa’s''This was easily the best durum I enjoyed in Berlin and rivaled the many I enjoyed in Turkey. The meat was fresh and juicy, the veggies were all fresh and the spicy chili oil was something I found myself wanting back in Turkey but was difficult to find. I may go so far as to say it was better than those I had in Turkey. It was incredible. At just €4.50 it’s also one of the best deals for food in Berlin.''Mercosy Korean Kitchen,\xa0Dresdener Str. 11, 10999 Berlin''Mercosy Korean Kitchen in Kreuzberg''On our last day in Berlin, my friend reached out to locals on social media to see if they had any recommendations. One response said that if we were fans of bibimbop we should head to''Mercosy Korean Kitchen''.\xa0We were and decided to pay them a visit.''We arrived to this tiny space with just a few tables inside and a couple more on the patio. It was a cold December day and we were excited to sit down indoors. We chose the business lunch option which is available during the week from noon until 5 p.m. It includes a bowl of bibimbop, tea and miso soup. At the recommendation of the waitress I went with the pork belly\xa0(€9) and my friend went with the vegan option\xa0(€6).''The tea and soup did a good job of preparing us for what we were about to enjoy. Cultivating ingredients from local organic farms, Mercosy strives to put out fresh, quality food. Once our bibimbop was delivered we both had to sit and stare at how beautiful it looked for a moment before digging in. Just for a moment though.''Pork belly bibimbop, €9''Kimchi, cabbage, sprouts, pomegranate, squash, green onions, basil and a poached egg were included in both of our dishes. Sesame seeds were sprinkled on top. It was quite an impressive looking dish. Add to that some spicy chili paste, soy sauce, chili oil and ginger oil offered on the side and we were in heaven. Everything went together perfectly. The flavor and texture combinations were impressive.''The overall taste and value of their Business Lunch options are fantastic.\xa0This turned out to be a truly memorable\xa0final meal in Berlin. I highly recommend giving Mercosy\xa0a try.''Note, I stayed primarily in Kreuzberg\xa0during my time in Berlin. This is a massive city with an equally large number of street food and restaurants\xa0for all palates and\xa0budgets. Having traveled through a majority of Europe, Berlin remains one of my favorite places\xa0in the world for culture\xa0and food. Hopefully the options I found help you to enjoy some great cuisine at affordable options during your next trip.''Meet Cam:''Cam is a food and travel blogger who left his career to eat his way around\xa0the world.

From playing in the snow to all of the adrenaline activities and cool things that you can do either solo or with friends, I was really impressed by the offerings there and found myself fantasizing about renting a little cottage there next winter, just so that I can ski on those uncrowded slopes and stare up at the sky hoping for aurora borealis.''Here are 13 things I tried and that I have a feeling you’ll love to when you visit Lapland:''Throw boiling water into the air and watch it turn to vapor''See?!?!''I’ve wanted to try this trick ever since seeing it on YouTube. If you’re somewhere cold enough, you can actually throw boiling water into the air and it will immediately turn into icy vapor. It feels like a magic trick! It got down to -27 C°/-16.6 F° while I was in Rovaniemi, Finnish Lapland, so it was just cold enough to work.''Tip: Try throwing a small amount away from you first to make sure it’ll actually work so that you don’t burn yourself if it’s not cold or dry enough.''Visit (or stay in) a hotel made entirely of snow and ice''At Snowman World''I visited two ice hotels while I was in Finnish Lapland –''Snowman World''in Rovaniemi, and''Snow Village''in Kittilä. What’s really cool about these is they change every year with new designs and ice sculptures. It takes a team of 30-ish people about two weeks to build them, and each was so big that it had at least a dozen or so themed rooms, plus an ice bar, restaurant, and snow art.''The space-themed room at Snow Village. Wow''Snow Village even had a church where several people have gotten married this year:''Worshiping the god of ice in the church of winter''One of the super cool corridors''Go snowmobiling''Snowmobiling in Lapland''In Lapland, snowmobiling is a way of getting from point A to B. Plenty of locals use snowmobiles as their main mode of transport in the winter, which I found pretty cool! You can even do multi-day explorations heading all the way into Sweden or Norway, which I’d love to try out next time I’m in the ‘hood.''It’s pretty easy to drive the snowmobiles, and they’re quite stable as well. I took one out on a frozen lake in Rovaniemi with''Lapland Safaris''(who have a location in\xa0Ylläsjärvi''as well) and totally had the hang of it after a couple of minutes. If you’ve ever driven a motorbike, you’ll find this to be even easier.''Go dog-sledding''In beautiful surroundings, to boot''Hey cuties!''Dog-sledding is actually a tradition from North America, but naturally it took me heading to the other side of the world to give it a try. The conditions in Lapland are perfect for the dogs, who do best in solid, dry snow, which occurs when it’s particularly cold outside.''If you’ve interacted much with Huskies then you’ll know how energetic they are. These guys were absolutely dying to run, and it was surprisingly peaceful, which I didn’t expect, to be on the back of their sled.''Snow shoe in the stillness of the night''Shining flashlights in the night''Finland is one of the safest countries in the world, particularly Lapland, so it’s no big deal to just go for a hike with some snow shoes on (you know, so you don’t just sink right into the thigh-deep snow) and go for a nighttime walk. I did so several times when I was there and it was so peaceful, I didn’t really want to leave.''Go for a sauna gondola''It was pretty cool''The Finnish sauna is a huge part of the culture and to be honest, the thought of going into a little wooden room and sweating my brains out didn’t appeal, but I suppose that’s because it''wouldn’t''appeal in the warm climate I come from. When it’s crisp and cold outside, though, it’s wonderful.''At the ski resort in Ylläs, you can actually rent a sauna gondola and afterwards you can drink beer, go in the jacuzzi outside, and use the other sauna inside as well. It doesn’t make much sense financially for one or two people but with a group of 12 and 4 trips around on the gondola, plus the VIP room inside, it’s actually a really cool idea and only costs €100 each.''Contact them here''if it piques your interest.''Then roll in the snow or dip into a freezing lake after''Post-sauna hot tub in the snow''I almost refused to run outside and jump into the hole cut in the ice of the lake after my first sauna, but this is the other part of the coin when it comes to Finnish tradition. After the extreme heat, you have to experience the extreme cold, then heat up again after and repeat. Some people jump into an ice lake, others roll in the snow. I ended up doing both and I felt so relaxed after, it’s actually something I’d do now without hesitation.''It’s mainly praised for its detox benefits, but athletes even use this method for''endurance training''! (Note: This is not for people with heart problems).''Look at those trees!''The Scenic Drive at Äkäslompolo''One of the most exciting things for me about visiting Lapland was that I would get to see what I call the who-ville trees. They’re tall, thin trees that have ice caked to their branches and at certain altitudes, they look other-worldly.''A frosty tree bathed in gold light''In\xa0Äkäslompolo, a village near the Ylläs ski resort, you can get high enough to see them and even hike through them at night. Several are lit up and they’re quite cool-looking.''Go Skiing''Loved skiing in Ylläs''The\xa0Ylläs ski resort had some really nice slopes, mainly because they go through those really cool trees, and there’s so much snow! I also had a few runs where I didn’t see another person my whole ride down.''I was also able to do four red runs in\xa0Ylläs, officially graduating from the blues I had been on when I learned how to''ski in Austria''just a week earlier. Skiing down those dreamy, wide, powdery slopes in Finland without the crowds gave me such a great opportunity to keep learning.''If you’re more into nordic skiing or snowboarding, you can do both there as well. Backcountry skiing and boarding are also popular there for the more advanced guys.''Go on a reindeer safari as the sun rises''I think his name should be Blitzen. I know,''real original''The people who live in Lapland used to use reindeer as their main mode of transport. The animals gave, and still do give, a lot to the local people in terms of food, warm clothing from their hides, and even tools from the antlers, which they lose and re-grow every year.''I loved learning that the reindeer are actually semi-wild, and each winter they voluntarily return to their ‘home’ stables because they know they can find food there. In the spring and summer, they live out in the forest where they forage and give birth to their young.''Catch the Northern Lights''The Northern Lights!''It’s never a guarantee that you’ll see the Northern Lights, of course, but Finnish Lapland is one of the main places where people go to catch them.''I\xa0got a bit unlucky with the weather and had cloud cover for most of the trip, but thankfully at around 12 midnight on my second-to-last night there, the clouds cleared and there was a little bit of aurora activity!

The flights are surprisingly convenient, especially through Helsinki.''Though there are busses and taxis, renting a car will give you ultimate freedom.

Besides the food at Aurora Estate, the best food I had was at''Pihvikeisari''where everything is local and homemade.

Remember the saying, “buy cheap, buy twice.”''Mine is''North Face brand''(their designs are changing all the time, so this is a link to something similar to what I have but not the exact same), so it’s great quality and has lots of pockets for the ski pass, cameras, and my phone, as well as reflectors for night skiing and a bright color so that I’m easily visible on the slopes.''I love these boots!''The boots''you wear when you’re not skiing are important, too. There are tons of other activities to check out when you’re on a ski trip that you’ll want good shoes for, like snow-shoeing, sledding (which requires that you use your feet as bakes), and even just walking around.''They should be super warm and also water proof.

I suppose most people from the US and Europe grew up with snow, or ski holidays, or both. I’m not one of those people, however, and I’ve only been to the mountains behind Los Angeles in the winter a couple of times, and never to ski.

Here are my favorite Austria winter activities:''Ski (of course!)''With my ski instructor, Zaki''I learned how to ski in Austria and thanks to the variety of slopes, it was a good place to get instruction while my friends hit the slopes more suited to their various skill levels. My instructor, Zaki, was super patient and experienced, helping me to advance from''beginner''to blue slopes quickly. Only a week later, by the time I reached Finland, I was already hitting the red slopes and I owe it to learning how to ski properly from day one.''I got my instruction and rentals from''Alpin-Skischule''and I liked this place in particular because the young owner is a sharp entrepreneur and I always love seeing that kind of thing from people my age, plus all the people who work there are so cool and laid back. Cherry on top is that\xa0the gear is super nice.''Go sledding''Sledding tiiiiiime!''I had no idea that it was possible to take a gondola up to the top of a mountain and sled down! That was a game-changer when I came across that possibility in Leogang. Apparently there are also tracks in Hinterglemm and Innsbruck.''I thought it was an excellent use of the lift ticket after a long day of skiing when my legs were too tired to keep me going but I wasn’t done having fun.''Snow shoe''What a view''Snow shoeing makes walking through the snow SO much easier''Snow-shoeing is another way to get a nice break from skiing. I was in Austria for nine days, so I wasn’t skiing for all of them and I also find that it’s nicer to ski in the morning and find other activities to do in the afternoon. You can rent some snow shoes and just take a walk in the snowy wilderness, or join a free organized hike, like''the ones Saalbach''. offers.''Best of all, the hike can take you here:''Hang out in the tree tops''So cool!''Austria’s Golden Gate Bridge''The tree walk''This is Austria’s ‘Golden Gate Bridge,’ followed by a tree walk. It’s open all year round but in the winter, I had it almost to myself. Apart from''Steve'', who took these awesome photos.''It was an awesome day, and we could even sled back down after, which we took advantage of (of course).''Be part of the family''My daily morning view at Lengauer hof''One of the best parts about choosing Austria for a winter holiday is the feeling you get when you’re there – it’s warm and cozy and I found that the locals were really kind and friendly, especially when I tried to speak German with them.''While skiing in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, I really loved staying at''Lengauer Hof'', where the owner, the employees, and even the other people staying there, were so friendly with each other. The rooms are nice and big, the food is really good, the view is really beautiful, and right from the hotel you can go snow-shoeing and sledding on the mini slope next door.''Try Biathlon''Biathlon is a sport that involves nordic skiing, which is on a flat track, then shooting a rifle at five targets. If the shooter misses a target, she/he has to go around the track one more time for every target missed. I had honestly never heard of this sport before but it’s big in Austria, especially in Fieberbrunn.''Nordic skiing was confusing to me after learning Alpine skiing, but I sure did love the target practice part of it.''Eat all the things!''Austrian food sticks to your bones. You seriously cannot go hungry while dining on Austrian food. My personal favorite was''Xandl Stadl\xa0in Hinterglemm''which serves a plate with grilled chicken, steak, pork, sausage, fries, and salad for, if memory serves, only €14. The food is farm-to-table and during the summer, the animals graze in the beautiful Alps. It was some of the most tender meat I’ve ever had.''Apres-ski''If skiing isn’t your thing, you don’t have to ski first to enjoy apres-ski (I won’t tell, promise). Apres-ski in Austria is really its own phenomenon. It’s basically a\xa0mountain hut that serves up drinks and German schlager songs with hilarious, repetitive, and sometimes PG-13 rated lyrics.\xa0The most''ridiculous''awesome apres-ski place that I found in Austria was the Goat Stall, which started out as just that – a goat stall.''It’s a family-run hut that has rainbow lights and rows and rows of tables in the snow, plus a dance floor with a guy in a goat suit waving his arms to the songs. There’s a ‘beer selfie’ station where you take a selfie as the machine pours you a beer, and even some sound-proof goat stalls when you walk in. To get back down to town, have a seat and sled down the hill, it’s fun!''Hang out''A cozy little balcony in laid-back Leogang''Chances are good that if you go to Skicircus in Austria, you’ll want to take advantage of the whole resort and visit the three different areas that recently connected this year to make it the largest ski resort in Austria (''you can read my full review of it here'').''In Leogang, the place to stay is definitely''Mama Thresl''.

Get it?''Rooftop pool-it''Loved this purple pool''In Fieberbrunn, another area of the skicircus known for off-piste (backcountry) skiing, there’s another place you can’t miss –''Hotel Alte Post''. What set this place apart was the spa which is two stories of the hotel and has this super cool rooftop pool that opens from a heated room inside to the outside, where snow was falling and the neighboring church bells were ringing.''It also had rooms with nothing but beds and headphones so that you can chill out after the pool or sauna.''If you have more Austrian winter activities to add, let me know in the comments!

So at 29 years young, I took up the skis once again to finally learn how to do it properly.''Pin me!''I was a little scared of learning how to ski due to a shoulder surgery I had a few years ago, plus, speeding face first down a mountain on two slick composite pieces seemed insane to me.\xa0I didn’t grow up in an area with much snow so winter isn’t something I’m used to, either. I was a beginner in every possible sense of the word.''It’s all about baby steps, though, and now I really enjoy skiing. Here’s my guide on skiing for beginners and winter newbies in general:''Get an instructor''Skiing with instructors''I know that your best friend, boyfriend, or parent probably thinks he/she knows all about skiing, but if you’re a beginner, or even a bit more intermediate or advanced, a proper instructor will make your learning experience so much easier.''You can join a group class, but for me, a private instructor allowed me to excel much more quickly. I was already on the mountain and off of the practice slopes by day two because we were able to go at my pace and all of the instruction was aligned with my abilities and learning speed. A private instructor where I learned in Saalbach, Austria, runs at\xa0€80/day.''Snow plow ’til you feel confident''After a lunch break''The snow plow is what you do when you widen your legs and push the front of the skis closer together, like a pizza slice. One you learn how to turn, you’ll lean your upper body downwards and your knees towards the slope. This is another means of slowing down when going downhill.''In time, you can snow plow less and let it go a little more when you’re comfortable with the speed and technique. Any time you just need to go slow, remember the snow plow.''Know that it’s far more mental than physical''Have fun with it''I saw kids who were only four years old on the slopes doing the same moves as I was, and realized that it’s not about physical ability. It’s really all mental.''Additionally, if you start to get negative about the sport or end on a bad run and want to give up, please give it another try. I had a similar day and really just wanted to quit but the next day I had a much better run and finally found my groove. From then onwards I finally enjoyed it.''Think less, move more''With my (very patient) ski instructor, Zaki''Kids fall less and worry less because they aren’t worried about old injuries or getting confused about other sports they’ve played that involve different body movements, all of which plagued me. They just copy what the instructor does and tend to learn more quickly.''The more scared you are and the more you stress about every little thing, the harder it will be. Skiing for a beginner will almost always involve a few falls and mistakes, but in time you’ll find your flow. Like absolutely every sport that I can think of, getting better just means practicing more.''Be patient with yourself''You might have an awesome run only to be followed by a run where you fall more, feel less confident, and need more encouragement. That’s totally okay, because if you think about everything else you’re good at, if you’re honest with yourself, you had ups and downs, right?''Skiing is the same, especially as the conditions on the mountain change and you get tired. Don’t get discouraged, just keep going!''Find a ski area with lots of options so that everyone’s happy''The view in Saalfelden Leogang''Most of the time I was skiing was just spent with my instructor since my friends were all at a different level. I had a few''Mozambique buddies''visiting who were more interested in back-country snow boarding since they’re much more experienced than I am,\xa0plus a couple of skiers who were more intermediate.''We were skiing at''Skicircus''which incorporates three different valleys and two regions of Austria, providing 270 kilometers of slopes between Saalbach Hinterglemm, Saalfelden Leogang, and\xa0Fieberbrunn. There were plenty of slopes for me as a beginner, plenty of red slopes for the intermediate guys, and plenty of off-piste (back-country) slopes as well. Everyone was happy that way and the scenery was incredible.''Take a break and do other activities in between''Sledding in saalfelden leogang''There are tons of things you can do other than skiing in mountains like the Alps in Austria. My personal favorite was sledding down the green slopes. You just take the gondola up, perhaps have a schnapps or two at the alm at the top, then sled back down, rinse, repeat. Extra points if you get into a snowball fight partway through.''I also snow-shoed through the wintery wilderness too, which I can’t recommend enough. It’s so nice to get a break from the slopes and get some solitude. The tourism office\xa0in''Saalbach-Hinterglemm''actually organizes the hikes for free if you find yourself there.''I also can’t leave out apres-ski, which is something Austria is known for – it’s all about German schlager songs with repetitive lyrics that make no sense and a big crowd of people dancing and singing while drinking warm drinks or cold beers then skiing back down after, or in my case, sliding down on a plastic bag. It was so much fun!''Pack the right stuff''My gear''If you’re a winter and skiing beginner like I was, then you might want to take a look at my''packing list''to make sure that you bring along all the things you’ll need for a ski trip.''Even though I feared the cold and winter, and especially skiing, prior to giving it a try, I’m so happy to report that I have a new addiction to the sport and you’ll see a lot more coverage of it from me.

As a first-timer, I didn’t really know what makes one ski area better than the other. When I asked a friend what makes skiing in Austria unique when compared to other Alpine ski areas,\xa0he said without hesitation, “It’s cozy.”''As I looked around the dining room that evening in Lengau, warm, framed by light-colored wood and pretty white tablecloths, plus the\xa0steaming plate of\xa0delicious braised beef and spätzle (a type of short and wide egg noodle) in front of me, I understood exactly what he meant. The waitress came by, dressed in a traditional dirndl, and kindly offered us another glass of wine in a singsong voice. It wasn’t an overly crowded food hall, it felt like I was sitting in someone’s dining room at home as a guest.''The hotels\xa0are mainly small and family-run in Alpine Austria. The food is from local, happy animals that graze in the green mountains when they’re not layered with snow, and the locals are incredibly friendly and welcoming. It’s an easy place to love and a difficult place to leave.''A cozy little balcony in laid-back Austria''The thing about these little villages in Austria is you always feel thought of. I caught myself continuously thinking to myself, “wow, they’ve really considered every little detail.”''It often feels more like you’re staying in someone’s home, or the very place the owner would want to hang out, when you lay your head to sleep each night.''Why Choose Skicircus?''Skiing in Saalbach is beautiful''I’d visited''Austria over the summer''and fell in love with the gorgeous Alps. I had no idea that they looked even more stunning and were more fun to visit in the winter, though. There must be hundreds of ski resorts in Austria so it’s not exactly easy to make a choice when it comes to picking which one to visit. Skicircus seemed like a good choice because of the huge variety it offers.''Skicircus just became Austria’s largest ski resort a couple of months ago. A\xa0new gondola joined two regions of Austria — Salzburg and Tirol — widening the\xa0offering to 270km of slopes split amongst three different\xa0ski areas –''Saalbach Hinterglemm'',''Saalfelden Leogang'', and''Fieberbrunn''.''Beautiful Saalbach Hinterglemm''Now, normally going to the biggest resort would turn me off. I’d be scared it would be too crowded or gimmicky. In reality, more slopes means more space for everyone and tons of options regardless of skill level (''I’m a newbie'').''The small villages have a warm and welcoming appeal, and rather than feeling like a number which I’m told is more common elsewhere in the Alps, you feel more like a guest.''From the top between Salzburg and Tirol''Just because the ski resort is larger doesn’t mean that it’s suddenly swarming with people in every village. Each has retained its own charm and individuality, at least that was the case when I was there.''Hinterglemm is the largest with the widest variety of slopes, Fieberbrunn is better known for ‘off piste’ or back-country slopes, and Leogang is famous for the gorgeous mountains all around and more blue-level slopes for beginners like me.''Leogang’s mountains''Gorgeous Fieberbrunn''The lift tickets are also much cheaper than what I’m used to in North America, where they usually run at $100 or so for a day. In Saalbach, it was just €51 for access to hundreds of kilometers of slopes. Plus, I’m sorry to say it, but I find the Alps to be more beautiful than the Rockies, and the food is better, too.''The Conditions''Snow erryday''I’ve Never spent this much time consecutively in the snow, but it was gorgeous and the perfect conditions for skiing day in and day out.''I had nine full days of snowfall\xa0while in the Skicircus. That meant that I had fresh powder to ski on every single day. We also got sunshine intermittently as well, so there were a few days with absolutely gorgeous scenery to look at while gliding down the mountains.''To get a better idea of the daily activities and what the slopes were like, my buddy Steve did a great job documenting it for the YouTube:''Thanks to my awesome experiences there, I got addicted to skiing and even did it again a week later in Finnish Lapland.

I can tell you, however, that it’s worth the pains to get around, because once you do reach your end destination, it’s sure to be stunning and\xa0the journey is half the adventure.''Obtaining the Visa''Previously, it was simple enough to get a visa on arrival at the airport or at land crossings into Mozambique. Recently, reports of Americans being denied entry at the border for not sorting out a visa ahead of time have surfaced,\xa0which means if you hail from the USA, you have to figure out the visa before you go.''The rules for other nationalities are (at least for now) as follows: If your country has a consulate or embassy for Mozambique, you are expected to obtain a visa ahead of time, unless you’re from one of the''eight bordering countries'', residents of which can travel to Mozambique visa-free.''I obtained my visa easily and on the same day at the''consulate in Johannesburg''. There is also one in Pretoria but it seemed silly to travel for an hour to get there when there was a consulate much closer to me in the city.

From Maputo, I took a 10-hour chapa to Tofo, which was\xa0a long and cramped\xa0experience but it’s the reality of traveling in Mozambique.''How locals travel in Mozambique''Traveling Within Mozambique''There is no simple or straightforward way to travel through Mozambique, I’m sorry to say. The following options are available but none are ideal:''Chapas:''Van taxis that stop often to pick people up and will try very hard to overcharge you if you don’t already know the price, and you’ll still overpay, that’s a guarantee. They are usually set to depart at 4am and will drive around for several hours finding people to pick up before they leave. It’s frustrating but it’s just how it is.''These vans are not in good condition, and they are usually filled to way over capacity, driving on bald tires on bad roads. I elected never to take a chapa again when, during my last ride, the driver swerved and''I saw him taking a swig of beer''while driving.''Car Rental:''If you bring a car through, chances are you’ll rent it in South Africa first. Most companies won’t let you bring a car rental to Mozambique but a few will. In those cases, make sure you have the proper documentation that allows you to drive across the border.''Another unavoidable byproduct of driving will be the police soliciting bribes. They will find a reason, no matter what, to pull you over. For example, two girls I met in Moz were pulled over and fined for having bags in the back seat because, “seats are for people, not bags.” There’s not much you can do in this case but haggle them down. Chances are good that you won’t have to pay much over the equivalent of $10 or $20 unless they really get angry with you.''Hitchhiking:''Hitchhiking and chapas were my main modes of transport in Mozambique, and while hitchhiking always has an element of risk, so does taking a chapa. Speaking Portuguese will help monumentally but as long as you ask around and find a logical spot for a ride, you probably won’t have to wait too long to get one. In some cases the driver will want a tip, but I was never asked for one.''Though''I’ve hitchhiked alone in China'', I spoke the language there and without knowledge of Portuguese, I suggest you at least go in pairs.''Flying:''I hate to dole out more horror stories, but two of my friends tried to leave Mozambique via airplane and three times, encountered technical issues mid-flight and had to turn around, because the only city with a mechanic is Maputo. Other friends experienced delays for days.''I flew out of Vilanculos back to South Africa at the end of my trip without any issues, apart from having to go to the airport to book the ticket because the online booking system was, of course, not working.

I was told that I’d get robbed in Maputo, that the border crossing would involve bribes, and that I might get pick pocketed. None of that turned out to be true and I actually really liked Maputo, and found Mozambicans to be generous and kind.''I just did what I always do – I stayed aware of my surroundings, brought''a bag lock'', which is a good idea in Mozambique where I never saw lockers, and when I did things like hitchhike or walk at night, I did so with others. I treated locals with respect and when I haggled, I did so with a smile.''Mozambique isn’t easy, but it is worth it.

Hitching a ride in Mozambique is common – it’s called a getting a boleia.''The flat-bed truck could only take us so far, so we got in a chapa – a local bus/van with bald tires and far too many people inside – to the next town. From there, I held my hand up and we got another ride in the back of a pickup truck, the hot African sun beaming down on us, and the mango trees, heavy with the weight of fresh orange fruit, lining the road. It was beautiful, until we got to the next dusty town where our driver was ending his journey. From there, after unsuccessfully trying to get a boleia for an hour, we finally took a chapa, and then another chapa, which had a drunk driver swigging a beer as he drove.''We stumbled into the backpackers well after dark, sweaty, dusty, and exhausted. The ride had taken seven hours to go a rather short distance. Such is Mozambique.''This is how I spent most of my time''The long and frustrating day was the perfect example of what it’s like to travel in Moz.

I had fun nights with new friends and with locals, but my favorite encounter of all was with Nate and Orlando.''Nate is a 21-year-old guy who has been living and working in the wilderness of Alaska. He’s well-traveled and came to Mozambique by word of mouth like I did. He had also''spent some time in Tofo''where he met\xa0Orlando, the local quad bike rental guy. Orlando invited Nate to his village just behind the beach in the palm trees – a little place where the kids playfully grab onto your quad as you pass by and try to run behind you, and the ladies sell coconut wine. It’s just a few grass and bamboo huts and it’s all that Orlando had ever known.''My buddy Evan, Orlando, Nate, and me''Nate got to know Orlando during his time in Tofo, and decided that it was a shame that Orlando had never even seen his own country. He’d never seen mountains, never felt the cold, and never knew anything other\xa0than the area immediately around him. Then Nate did something extraordinary – he invited Orlando to join him on his trip through Mozambique, and offered to pay his way.''The relationship made sense in so many ways. Orlando got to see his country, and Nate got to have a true local experience.''The day I met them, we decided to go down to the beach and buy a fish from a local fisherman. We got a big one, the size and taste of a tuna, for around $6 thanks to Orlando’s negotiating. Nate filleted the fish and Orlando got to cooking. First he cooked a fish soup with potatoes and carrots, then a fish filet which we ate with coconut rice and matapa – a local green leafy vegetable smashed\xa0and cooked with coconut milk. We bought Orlando beers and I did the dishes after, splitting the work.''That night we went down to the ocean and pointed out the constellations to Orlando. He was smiling from ear to ear, seeing a beach he’d never seen before in his life. Nate’s was such a beautiful gesture, and it made wonder why\xa0more people don’t\xa0do this. It’s a small way of giving back but in such a generous and kind way.''Their story inspired me so much, I asked them if I could share it with you, and thankfully they said yes.''I hope that they made it to the mountains, and I hope that Orlando saw more amazing things that he’d never had the opportunity to see\xa0before.''The view when I flew out of Vilanculos, Excuse the grainy phone pic''As for me, Vilanculos was my last stop in Moz, and as I flew out over the sand bars back to South Africa, I silently promised to find a way back one day – just not on a chapa.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Tofo, Mozambique: Paradise You Never Knew Existed''Going Alone to Mozambique''Maputo is Not as Bad as They Say''I know of a place that few others do.''It’s the kind of place where the silica-rich sand squeaks beneath your feet, you stop wearing shoes of any kind, don’t even think about brushing your hair, and since there aren’t any mirrors around, you stop thinking about how you look, too.

It’s just the way it goes in a place where life moves slowly.''The backpackers I stayed at – Fatima’s Nest''Unlike most beaches this pristine and beautiful, Tofo’s tourism appears to be on the decline.

I met them a week prior when, on my walk back to my guesthouse, I passed by a few friendly-looking faces in the hammocks and stopped to chat with them for a while. I didn’t realize it then, but they’d turn out to be one of the best, most solid crews I’ve ever met while traveling, if not the most amazing to date. I ended up spending the rest of my three weeks in Africa with them, practically joined at the hip.''We were a crew of 20 and 30-somethings from different corners of the world; some from the US, and some from Australia, Switzerland, and Canada. Some were Peace Corps volunteers and the rest had arrived there thanks to word of mouth, just like I had.''They’d been digging a giant hole in the sand for hours that\xa0day. It was the brain-child of Jonas, a 20-year old from Switzerland whose spirit animal is undeniably a meerkat. He could not let go of the idea of making this happen and had spoken about it for days.''His master plan was to make a hole big enough to fit nine people, because that’s just what you do when you have a group of intelligent people together in paradise with a lot of time on their hands, isn’t it? He was so enthusiastic about it that everyone got on board because, why not?''They must have literally moved tons of sand.''As soon as I arrived, they chided, “Kristin’s here!” which I have to tell you is one of the nicest things to hear when you rock\xa0up to a group of people. Feeling genuinely welcomed is right near the top of my list of favorite feelings in the world.''The hole was ridiculously huge, and when it came time to bury them\xa0so that we could get some photos before sunset, everyone around helped, from the beach boys who had been selling us coconuts for the past two weeks to random passers by who decided to get involved.

He referenced times he had to hitchhike on the side of the road, got lost, or just openly appealed for help and when he needed it, and it always found him. The amount of kindness that people have shown him over and over, every single time he has had no choice but to rely on it, has reaffirmed this belief.''His words resonated because I’ve long felt the very same thing. Every time I thought things were hopeless; when I was lost and someone showed me the way, when I stood on the''side of the road hoping for a ride'',\xa0or''I lost my debit card''and someone bailed me out, I was also shown that people are fundamentally good. Nothing has ever been so catastrophic that it couldn’t be redeemed by a random act of kindness. The majority of the time, it was someone who had less than I do, or was a perfect stranger,''who gave the most''.''I often wondered, and was even told by others, that I was naive and idealistic for feeling this way, and that those things don’t just happen to everyone. To hear him say the very same thing that I felt down to my core finally affirmed what I know to be\xa0true: The world and the people in it are more kind, giving, and similar to each other than unkind, greedy, and different to each other. Even without speaking the same language, we can find a common ground.''It also confirmed that what you put out there is what you get back. He and I are both open and giving but also understanding and not afraid to ask for help. People will give when they feel that kind of loving and receptive spirit, and when people ask me for help, I pay it forward.''I felt so lucky in that moment to be surrounded by such positivity. It’s one of those things you optimistically hope for but know better than to expect when you travel. It’s a rarity to find such wonderful people to share your time with and the kind of thing that can only happen when all of the right situations come to pass that allow you to meet the people who create that spark.''I owe these moments to traveling solo and being open to serendipity. It brings along the spirit that travel has always carried\xa0for me: It’s an unexpected adventure with people you have only just met but who you could be you friends for life. Every new encounter has the potential to change your trajectory and you simply never know what or who\xa0in the world might come your way next.

He said I was welcome to stay as long as I liked and once I landed and made my way there, they\xa0welcomed me immediately and invited me up to one of the lookout points in the city for the sunset.

It reminded me why, from the beginning, I’d principally sought travel like this – new in a room where nobody knew me, a chance to learn so much about the local culture, an opportunity to come into something existing and lasting as a guest and to reap the energy and carry a bit of it away with me.''Over the next couple of days I obtained a Mozambican visa, bought a bus ticket, had a couple of BBQs and a pool day with my''couchsurfing''host, then left on an early morning 10-hour bus bound for Maputo – the capital of Mozambique.''I’d heard nothing but horror stories about the city and the border crossing. The police were''rumored to be corrupt''and everyone told me not to go out at night and to get out of the city as quickly as possible. I’d also been told that it was likely I’d have to pay bribes at the border, so when I arrived, I was ready for a challenge.''I\xa0felt a bit like a video game character advancing a level with each officer who reached out his hand for my passport and asked\xa0questions, wondering if he’d\xa0be the one to ask for money.''“You’re from California!

Still nothing.''“I only know Hollywood,” he replied, sheepish. “Yes, California,” I smiled.''I could tell he wasn’t used to being corrected, and he’d gone from appearing the most eager and likely to ask for a bribe to just wanting me to walk away, then handed my passport back over and wished me a good time in Mozambique.''Most of the land crossings I’ve experienced in Africa are the same: hot, incredibly dusty and dirty, and crawling with hawkers trying to sell everything from SIM cards to a horrible exchange rate for some US dollars. Cars, trucks and buses funnel through as the foot traffic weaves to the sides and through the middle, forming a line for a stamp into the next place. A new horizon, a fresh adventure.''I boarded the bus again and sat myself next to a Portuguese woman. She was petite, wearing dark jeans in the insane summer heat, and stared pensively out the window in between nodding off to sleep and reading. Her dark curly hair grazed her large, black-framed glasses and I figured\xa0she be\xa0an artist (which was true). We started talking and I expressed to her that I was worried about Maputo, and she wrinkled her brows and said, “give it a chance, and I think you’ll find that there’s a soul to it.”''I stepped off the bus after the better part of 10 hours, which weren’t all that bad for some reason (my ability to sleep anywhere, any time, perhaps?) to a taxi driver greeting me promising that he was from my hostel, Fatima’s. I was skeptical but what options did I have? So I went along. He tried to charge me nearly $8 for the ride, which for only 2km I knew was way too expensive. He gave me the upper hand when he took my bag out of the trunk and handed it over before I paid, so I asked him to kindly wait a moment while I grabbed the hostel manager who talked him down to the standard rate of $4.''My years of traveling have served me well.''Maputo by Hansueli Krapf via\xa0creative commons (I didn’t take my camera out in Maputo for safety reasons)''After checking into the hostel, sweaty and tired, a tall, dark-haired Brazilian man previously sitting at his computer with headphones on came over and handed me a coffee.''“You look like you could use this,” he said with a smile.''Later that night he and a local hostel employee invited my dorm mate, a tall, blonde, 18-year old English girl named Ella who had just started her solo travels, and in Mozambique of all places, and me out to an art gallery party (''Nucleo de Arte'', if you’re interested). Remembering what the Portuguese woman had told me, I accepted and so did Ella.''What unfolded was easily one of the best dance parties I’ve ever been to. Contrary to what I’d heard about Maputo, everyone there was dressed nicely, spoke English well, and appeared far more polished than I was in my comfy shorts and loose shirt.''The art was impressive, and so was the music. The sound system was shockingly good and the locals tended to form circles, each doing a dance that she or he had clearly perfected for years – it was each person’s individual move and the competition was fierce. The Afro-house music blasted until after midnight and I tried to forget about my 4am bus departure the next morning.''In the midst of the good energy and beats, that’s when you find a dance move you never had in you before, and an appreciation for something you never realized you’d always yearned for. It nestles it self right into your heart where it will probably prod you forever – this night, this place, this feeling.''I realized that night that I was happy to be on the trip alone, as I’d opened myself up to serendipity. That’s the thing about solo travel, because otherwise the most important person in the room is missing: The real you. It’s the person you are when nobody you know is around to influence you.''I always say traveling doesn’t change you but rather allows you to truly be who you’ve always been.

That wasn’t in the cards for Iceland, but by splurging on certain things and saving on others, my buddy, Maksim, and I were able to enjoy the country with maximum freedom and minimal costs.''My personal spend for 11 days in Iceland was $937 before the flight, or $93 per day.''Here’s the breakdown:''Accommodation in Iceland''At the Jökulsárlónn Glacier Lagoon''Maksim and I might have been able to stay for a bit cheaper in Reykjavik had we gone for a hostel dorm room, but I honestly feel like those days are behind me now after doing dorms for 2 years straight in Southeast Asia.

They don’t have a policy that you have to refill the gas before returning the car, so that saved us some cash!''As for driving the ring road, I feel that there’s no better option than a 4×4 camper van, as I mentioned before. It allowed us to see some\xa0waterfalls and explore the highlands that\xa0aren’t accessible\xa0without a 4×4 car. We also saw the northern lights three out of the seven nights we were''camping the ring road'', simply because we had flexibility. Plus, we could stop any time we wanted to take photos.''Gas is expensive in Iceland as well, but when split between two or even three people, it’s doable.''Food''Food is very expensive in Iceland. A basic grocery store sandwich will set you back €9!''The cheapest grocery stores are Kronan, Netto, and Bonus. Most of the cheaper stores are closer to Reykjavik, so stock up on imperishables before you leave.''A big way that Maksim and I saved money was by cooking everything ourselves in the camper van, which has a sink, stove, and cookware. We never even set food in a restaurant in Iceland. Maybe we missed out, but this was our way of saving money so that we could splurge on other things.''Each morning we had meusli and tea, for lunch we had sandwiches that we made ourselves, which made it much cheaper, for snacks we had boiled eggs and cookies and crackers with cream cheese, and for dinner we’d often have sausages and potatoes or pasta with pesto that Maksim brought with him from Germany.''As for drinks, the water in Iceland is free and safe to drink as long as it’s the cold water and not the bubbling sulfuric stuff (obviously).''If you think you’ll want alcoholic drinks during your trip, make your purchases in duty free before you leave your home or at Reykjavik airport. (Update: You can find liquor outside of the airport but they’re expensive and beer is weak and expensive as well).''Connectivity''If you have an unlocked phone, definitely get a Vodafone SIM card! It only cost me €13 for 3 gigabytes of data which was shockingly good all over the country. Maksim and I didn’t even need to use our GPS because the coverage was so good, we just used Google Maps on our phones to navigate.''Travel off-peak to save''Maksim and I actually cut our expenses down significantly by traveling during off-peak season. In the spirit of full disclosure, I was also provided a media discount for my 4×4 rental. Regardless, you can expect just about everything, from car and 4×4 rentals, to accommodation, to be about double the price during high season, which is during the summer. Most of the campgrounds are also free during the off season since there’s nobody around to manage them, but they still remain open to discourage back-country camping and off-roading.''You also have almost no chance of''seeing the northern lights''in the summer, which was too important to me to miss.''Extras''Maksim and I spent €75 each for a whale watching excursion and that was amongst the cheapest tours available in Iceland.

The rumors that Iceland is expensive are true, but at least little things like this don’t set you back any krona.''This national park is full of cultural, historical, and natural significance for Iceland. It marks the convergence of the North American and Eurasian\xa0tectonic plates\xa0and is also where the Icelandic Parliament was established.''There are several rift valleys throughout the park, some of which you can dive and''snorkel in'', with incredibly clear water. Others are full of rocks and beautiful green grasses and red leaves.''I mean, wow''The area\xa0became a World Heritage Site in 2004 and\xa0borders Iceland’s largest lake.

If you’ve ever been near an active volcano crater before, you’ll know I’m referring to that rotten egg smell.''These geysers and bubbling pools are super cool to see, though, and not far from the next attraction:''Gullfoss''This is a pretty incredible waterfall, seeming to fall sideways in a staircase fashion into a crevice that is 105 feet (32 meters) deep. It seems to appear out of nowhere and vanish just as quickly.''Wow''This waterfall is notable not only for its massive size but for the great measures taken to preserve it.''The waterfall owner’s daughter, Sigríður Tómasdóttir, is credited as Iceland’s first environmentalist thanks to her determination to preserve the waterfall. When European investors attempted to dam the waterfall to provide power, and profits, she threatened to throw herself into the waterfall.''Loved the purple sunset there''Today, it’s one of Iceland’s most visited sights.''Kerið Crater Lake''Just a note on the crater lake, since Maksim and I decided to skip it (you’ll see why later in this post). The lake is notable for its red rather than black volcanic rock and is only half as old as most of its volcanic surroundings.''If you have time, you can make this your last stop on the Golden Circle before making your way back to Reykjavik.''Kleifarvatn''The next morning, we decided to head a bit south of Reykjavik and explore an even more spectacular lake en route to yet another geothermal area\xa0more popular with hikers.''The drive there was a beautiful adventure in itself, full of moss-covered stones and a seriously cool-looking sky:''Dat moss doe''The drive to Kleifarvatn''The drive around the lake is beautiful, full of lookout points and places to stop. Maksim and I even saw a couple having their wedding photos taken there, complete with a white gown on the black sand. It was magical (but I didn’t want to take her photo because I wanted to be respectful).''This lake is huge!''Beautiful Kleifarvatn''Krýsuvík''This area is full of geothermal fields and bubbling mud pots including the famous\xa0Seltún. There were fewer tourists here than at the others geysers mentioned previously and while none of these shot up in the air, if you’re a hiker, you’ll love this spot.''Walking the plank''Seltún''The area is also known for its soil, which you can see in the photos.

It’s on the way, plus you will have the most relaxed flight home after.''The water is warmer in some places than others so move around to get the best spot. You can also buy a few drinks for around $8 each, which is about what I’d pay back in Los Angeles, so I didn’t think that was too bad!''The lagoon also has clay mud you can rub on your face if you feel like it. Fair warning; I have naturally dry skin and it did dry me out, but most masks tend to.''A final lagoon tip: if you want to get your hair in the water, coat it with conditioner first as the sulfuric water can leave it feeling dry and crispy.''When you land'': Maksim and I booked an''airport transfer''that got us close to our hotel and on the way back, we included a stop at the Blue Lagoon.''Rent:''I recommend renting a clunker from''Sad Cars''because they’re super cheap and you don’t have to return the car filled with gas.

One moment the sun will be shining and the next, you’ll be driving through a storm of hail, wind, and rain. In fact, the wind is so strong, it can blow a car door right off its hinges, seriously!''Regardless of the time of year (I went in October), bringing waterproof clothing that can protect you from the wind, and potentially snow and hail, is essential to your comfort while traveling through Iceland. Thankfully, the Gulf Stream\xa0keeps Iceland’s temperatures from plummeting much past freezing in the winter but its latitude also means that even in the summer, temperatures don’t get much higher than 50°F/10°C.''The great thing about the varied weather is it makes Iceland incredibly green and beautiful. Thanks to the rain, often followed directly after by sunlight, it’s the land of waterfalls and rainbows. Who doesn’t love waterfalls and rainbows? Personally, I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t smile at both.''So how do you pack for a place that experiences so many different types of weather in one day? Bring layers, and make sure your clothes are waterproof!''Most important item #1: Warm, waterproof jacket''At the Jökulsárlónn Glacier Lagoon''A good jacket''is the most important thing, apart from good footwear, that you will pack for your trip to Iceland. If you go any time other than the height of summer, chances are good that you will experience freezing temperatures, especially if you head to the highlands, so something warm that keeps out moisture is essential.''During my trip, we encountered nearly 48 hours of straight rain and snow, so a jacket that got soaked easily would have been a real drag. I was so glad to have my warm jacket along with me, plus, the red was the perfect color for standing out against the background!''In Landmannalaugar – Iceland’s Highlands''I spent €250 on my jacket at a department store in Berlin. Online, it’s only available in Sweden, but''here’s a jacket that is almost exactly the same and even a bit cheaper''. It comes in black, too!''Most important item #2: High-quality, waterproof snow boots''Hanging out in Krýsuvík, Iceland''The other item to allot more of your packing budget to is snow boots. These will keep your feet warm and dry, and high-quality ones will stand the test of time, too!''I brought two pairs along with me and was glad I did. Though they kept the water out for the most part, that time I was jumping across freezing rivers of water in\xa0Landmannalaugar and couldn’t quite clear the water, I dunked my entire leg and was very glad that I had a dry pair of boots back in the camper van.''My pairs are wool-lined''Ugg Brand Elsa boots'', and the pair I’m wearing above are a few seasons old, but are just like''Sorel’s version which comes in tons of adorable colors''and sizes.''Keep warm with fleece-lined leggings''Love the fleece-lined leggings!''My fleece-lined leggings were perfect for keeping my legs just warm enough for the temperature in Iceland, which was right around freezing for most of the time that I was there in October.

It’s so worth it!).''The following are things I learned and tips to help you on your journey camping Iceland’s ring road:''Go in the Autumn''A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Oct 27, 2015 at 3:18am PDT''I get that you can’t always pick when you have time to go somewhere on vacation, but just about everywhere that I can think of is perfect in the Autumn, mainly because the weather is still pleasant and the crowds are much smaller. Plus, changing leaves are drop-dead gorgeous.''In Iceland, Autumn is particularly spectacular because the ground also changes color from green to yellows, reds, and oranges. Plus, it’s much more likely\xa0to see the Northern Lights since nightfall is around 7pm, which means you get a nice amount of daylight and darkness. In the summer, it’s bright almost all the time and the opposite is true in the winter.''Another plus: Iceland’s low season means you can plan on half price for things like camper vans and accommodation.''Get a camper van''Our noble steed''A camper van''is, without a doubt, the best way to see and camp around Iceland’s Ring Road and will provide the best opportunities for finding the Northern lights.''One night in the highlands, we had no choice but to hole up in the van and pray for the''insane''wind to stop when we came to a closed road (''find road closures here'') a few km from the campground. Having a camper van allowed us to cook dinner\xa0and sleep soundly (well, as soundly as one can sleep with wind the strength of a jet stream pummeling you) without any problems.''The camper van also allowed us to camp and wake up at the glacier lagoon on the third day, as they allow camper vans but not tents in the parking lot. That allowed us to combine the northern lights at night and a sunrise over the lagoon in the morning. It was wonderful having that kind of flexibility and we saved a lot on food and accommodation.''Click to get travel tips via email!''Camp for half off or even free''The biggest reason to go in the fall\xa0is costs. Car and camper rentals in Iceland are easily double the price in the high season months of the summer. We saved''half''the money\xa0by renting in the fall.''That, and most of the campgrounds were ‘closed’ but still kept their gates and facilities open since tourism is such big business in Iceland and they want to discourage camping anywhere other than designated spots. That means you can use them for free (seriously).''Get a van with a heater''If camping any time other than the summer, rent a camper that has a space heater in the back. It’s separate to the heater in the front that runs off of the engine when the car is on. It uses gasoline, but it’s efficient and I never even noticed a dip in the fuel levels, despite\xa0running it all night.''The one in my van worked really well, and was a great place to hang\xa0things in front of that needed to dry out. Given the first 48 hours\xa0of the trip were either rainy or snowy with no break in the precipitation, this was quite handy.''Pick someone you <3 to go with and be gentle with each other''My Buddy, Maksim''A solid week of 24/7 time spent together ain’t easy. Maksim and I are buddies and we were really tested by the initial 48 hours of constant bad weather the first two days, given we barely spent any time outside of the van and if we did, we ended up cold and wet. We were in pretty close quarters that entire time and if we hadn’t been patient with each other, it could have been a nightmare.''It’s important to be gentle with each other, be open and honest if something is bothering you (the other person may have no idea!), and to laugh and joke as much as possible. Pick someone you know that’s all possible with.''If you’ll want drinks, buy them at the airport''It’s not possible to buy hard liquor at stores in Iceland. If you want anything like that before you go, stash it in your checked baggage, buy it at your departure airport in duty-free, or purchase at the airport in Reykjavik when you land. It’s your only chance.''I like my whiskey, so we bought a couple bottles (that we didn’t even finish, actually), at duty-free before going.''You can use a credit card for (almost) everything''I never withdrew any money in Iceland because I was able to use my credit card absolutely everywhere. The only places that you might want coins are for laundromats and campsite showers (but more on showers later).''I didn’t have a card with a chip at the time, and it presented no issues. Just ask them to swipe it.''Navigating and GPS''I rented the GPS but found I never used it. I wanted the power point to charge my other electronics, and most of all, I was downright astounded at how good the coverage from Vodaphone was.''Even in the highlands, hours away from any towns, I still had coverage. Any time we needed to figure out where to go, we just used Google Maps. Bonus, this is one of the cheap things in Iceland as 3 gigabytes of 3G was less than USD $15. (You’ll, of course, need an unlocked phone to use a local SIM).''Cook all your own food to save money''I’d read before I left that hot dogs are pretty popular in Iceland. I''base myself in Germany''for part of the year\xa0and''it’s a requirement on the visa application that you love sausages'',\xa0I’m cool with sausage but I also don’t want that or instant noodles for every meal.''Even a pre-made sandwich at the grocery store will cost around $8. It’s much better to buy individual\xa0ingredients and cook or make sandwiches yourself. It takes a little bit of extra time but chances are you’ll already be parked for the night anyways or can spare 5 minutes to make a sandwich.''Camper vans are equipped with a sink and running water that is easy to refill, a camp stove that runs off of propane, and\xa0cooking utensils. Easy peasy.''Stock up on imperishable items in Reykjavik before you go''Maksim and I learned the hard way that those nifty budget grocery stores (Bónus,\xa0Krónan, and Netto) that are a dime a dozen in Reykjavik were a lot harder to find once already on the ring road. Stock up on things that won’t go bad easily, such as pasta, potatoes, and cereals. They’ll increase in price if you have to buy at the smaller, more expensive stores.''Tip: There is a Netto in\xa0Egilsstaðir in the Eastern Fjords.''For your Iceland Pinterest board''My Ring Road food system''I actually never set foot in a restaurant in Iceland. I knew they were expensive and since we had a\xa0well-equipped camper van,\xa0cooking was the best bet.''There was a system we implemented early on in the Ring Road to make things easier and to preserve and re-use ingredients before they went bad. It worked pretty well:''Mornings: Muesli (or whatever cereal you like) and hot tea.''Lunch: Soft-boiled eggs as snacks boiled the night before in the leftover pasta or potato water and sandwiches with tomato, thinly-sliced cucumber (one cucumber lasts forever but lettuce won’t), a mix of ham and salami, and some amazing sauce of the gods called Remoulade. Seriously that stuff is good.\xa0We resolved to keep eating sandwiches\xa0until we got tired of them, which, after a week, we never did.''Dinner: Wither pasta with chopped peppers and pesto sauce (we had four kinds that Maksim brought from Germany), or boiled sausages with potatoes. I also boiled frozen veggies with my meals. Unless the weather is nice enough to cook outside, boil what you eat when cooking indoors or you’ll have an oily mess to deal with after and your clothes will smell like sausage.''Snacks: A ridiculous amount of boiled eggs, crackers with cream cheese, and cookies. We really like cookies.''Fill up on gas early and often''Loved this car''It’s tough to know when you’ll come across another gas station, so when it gets to a half tank, start thinking about filling up, especially in the Eastern Fjords.''We never even got close to running out, but better safe than sorry.''You can fill up on water too!''Iceland has no shortage of water, and you can pretty much always find it for free at gas stations. There’s usually\xa0a hose around that you can use to fill up water bottles and the water tank in your camper van.''If you are taking a lot of 4×4 roads and need to give the car a shower, you can do that for free, too! There are usually also hoses with large brushes attached just for that purpose.''So if you’re camping, where do you shower?''At the Blue Lagoon''I’m glad you asked, because it’s actually pretty neat\xa0to check out\xa0Iceland’s public swimming pools that cost anywhere from 350-600kr (USD $2.75 – 5.75) for a shower and a dip in the heated pools. They are super popular with locals and seem to be in just about every town and village, no matter how small.''You can also shower at the campsites if they’re open. The prices run about the same and you’ll need coins and will get just a few minutes. You can take as long as you want at the swimming pools. Find locations and''hours of operation here''.''For the love of God, bring your own towel''I preach to always have a pack towel in my''packing guides''but somehow completely forgot to bring one to Iceland. Major fail. I spent around 600 kronar, per shower, to rent one.''If you’re wondering why I didn’t just buy one, I found they ran around 2200 kronar. It would have evened out eventually but\xa0I’ll let you do the math on why I didn’t buy one (#noshame).''Hold onto the door!''I didn’t believe it at first when we picked up the van and the girl at the shop told us to hold onto the door in windy weather. Why? It can blow right off the hinges – the wind in Iceland is that strong!''One of the doors on our vehicle almost did blow clear off, and had to be fixed after, which brings me to the next point:''Get all of the insurance''Driving the ring road for a week or more means you’ll encounter\xa0all kinds of weather and road conditions that you might not have expected. I had no idea before we started how''real''the weather was going to be. Sand storms can happen, as can hail, insane wind, and all kinds of gravel marks, especially if you take a 4×4 road.''Insure your rental fully, except for theft insurance since nobody steals cars in Iceland. Honestly, people even leave them running when they go to the grocery store!''You should also''make sure that you have travel insurance''for yourself, just in case you get sick or need to go home early for medical reasons. The best case scenario is that you don’t need it but it will keep you covered in the worst-case scenario.''Bring warm and waterproof clothing''Hanging out in Krýsuvík, Iceland''Chances are good that at some point in Iceland you’ll encounter rain, and when it rains in Iceland, it''rains''.''I was really glad to have waterproof boots with me. It was also a good idea to have two pairs, because during one of our hikes I had to jump across about 20 freezing streams of water and, despite those years doing high jump in high school, couldn’t quite clear it and ended up dunking my leg up to my knee. Maksim suffered the same fate but he only had one pair of shoes.''Mine are Ugg brand and you can similar ones''here''and''here''.''Check out this post for my full''Iceland packing list''.''Bring extra chargers or the battle for the power outlet could turn ugly''I travel with a''portable charger''that holds four charges in it. It was super helpful to have that along considering my phone served as a GPS and I was using it for work as well (Snapchat,''Instagram'', emails, etc.), plus,''my new camera''needs to be charged more often than my old one did, and I have a''GoPro'', plus, Maksim wanted to charge his stuff too.''In our van there was only one power outlet, which I think is probably standard, so it was a great idea to have another method for charging available.''If you want to photograph the Northern Lights, bring the right gear''Iceland’s Northern Lights''Iceland’s Ring Road drive had long been on my list because I wanted to photograph the heck out of it. I was really hoping to catch the Northern Lights and was able to find them three times because before setting off on the trip, we looked at the''weather and aurora forecast''and headed south rather than north on the chance that we’d get clear skies mid-week. It paid off!''I knew that I needed certain equipment for photographing them, such as a''tripod''and a''remote'',\xa0and thankfully neither were expensive.''I was also able to get some neat long exposure shots of all the waterfalls with those two items, as well as a''CPL filter''.''A long-exposure shot of Kirkjufellsfoss''Check out my''Iceland photography tips''for more on how to photograph the Northern Lights and waterfalls.''Protect your gear''After my last phone succumbed to the elements, I decided I wasn’t going to let that happen again and before going to Iceland, I bought a''LifeProof case''that would protect it even from freezing temperatures. I used to dislike similar cases because they’re so bulky, but this one is much sleeker and totally worked.''I took it out in the rain, under the water in the blue lagoon, close to waterfalls, and in the snow and it protected me the whole time. I felt that it was definitely worth the cost\xa0of the case to protect my $900 phone. Plus, I can take my phone in the shower now to play music. Win!''Watch out for suicidal sheep''From my snapchat: @KrisLikeWhaat''Sheep will just run right out in front of you without even thinking about it. Probably because they don’t think much?''It’s difficult to know what’s going through their little sheep brains when they dart across the roads but they sure are cute and it’s hilarious to watch them running. It’s just not so hilarious to hit one. Keep your eyes open for them, especially when driving at night.''Make the back of the van a no-shoe zone to keep it clean''On day one we declared the back of the van, where we slept and ate, a no-shoe zone. That was our saving grace as far as keeping it clean.''The shoes and bags sat in the front seat while we slept so that we had ample space and clean digs.''Don’t be that guy who stops in the middle of the road to take photos''It’s really tempting to just stop in the road and take a quick photo when driving the ring road, but I noticed that there were always places to pull over and get out of the car. We always found an option, and it was frustrating when others just stopped in the road for long periods of time for photos.''Be kind to those around you and just pull off the road in a clear spot where it’s ok to do so.

This was fine given nobody was crazy enough to drive that road in that weather in the dark, and the nice camper van had heating and kitchenette. After a cup of whiskey to chase the fear away I slept like a baby – rocking back and forth in the (strong as h$@l) wind. I’ve heard great things about the whole F-208 road, but unfortunately due to flooding and closures, we couldn’t go any further than Landmannalaugar and never got to check out the camp 30km away.''Day Two: Landmannalaugar Hike and Drive to Seljalandsfoss''Hiking In Landmannalaugar – Iceland’s Highlands''I awoke to snowy surroundings and thanked the universe for letting me live through the previous night’s storm. Landmannalaugar is a great place to hike for an hour or two, though one could do so for days or even weeks, so we explored a bit, eager to see the mountains that looked like painted hills.''The partially hidden mountains''Hiking around took half of the day while retracing our steps and heading back to the Ring Road filled the other. We spent most of it jumping over about two dozen freezing streams of water across the valley and finding a waterfall, only to lose the trail in the snow and jump right back over them to head back to the starting point.''The Waterfall''Our\xa0goal for the rest of the afternoon was to thaw out, dry off, and make it to Seljalandsfoss for an AM viewing of the waterfall, especially since sunrise there is particularly famous.''Technically, I didn’t really start\xa0driving the actual Ring Road in the daytime until day three. But my, what a dazzling introduction it turned\xa0out to be.''Map'':''Seljalandsfoss''Camp:''There’s a great little campsite right next to Seljalandsfoss. Highly recommended if you’d like to catch the sunrise at the falls!''Day Three: Skógafoss,\xa0Fjaðrárgljúfur, and the Black Waterfall''Second morning shower at Seljalandsfoss''Waking up to a massive waterfall is an\xa0excellent way to start the day, and I simply can’t believe I hadn’t tried it until hitting Iceland. I suppose I can credit that to few opportunities, but everyone should do it at least once!''Seljalandsfoss is popular with tourists, so don’t expect to get it to yourself, and you will get wet if you want to get behind it for photos. We didn’t get a sunrise that day thanks to the clouds. That said, it is impressive, and the drive from there to\xa0Skógafoss is delightful, punctuated with tons of waterfalls and green misty mountains.''Loved the drive!''Skógafoss''Skógafoss''Skógafoss is also popular with tourists thanks to its massive flow and relative proximity to Reykjavik. It’s very close to the Ring Road and worth a quick photo stop.''I’m not exaggerating when I say that we saw hundreds of waterfalls streaming from green cliff edges and volcanic basalt columns throughout the drive. I kept wondering to myself how one waterfall could be more famous than another considering there must be thousands, no exaggeration, all across Iceland. There are tons that you’ll pass during the trip that would all be famous if they existed in other countries. But in Iceland, waterfalls are a dime a dozen.''Fjaðrárgljúfur''Fjaðrárgljúfur is too cool (and seriously, it got a little scary sitting there once I processed that I was dangling on a cliff edge – a very real cliff edge)''Fjaðrárgljúfur from below''Fjaðrárgljúfur from the other side''I got the inspiration to visit\xa0Fjaðrárgljúfur, along with most of the other places we stopped at, from a combination of looking around Instagram for suggestions and consulting a big picture book that my buddy Maksim brought (which was in German, but there’s a similar English version''here''). For us, the easiest way to pick and choose was visually. If one of us enthusiastically said, “Wow, I''really''want to go there!” we added it to the itinerary if we could possibly fit it.''Fjaðrárgljúfur is a canyon that is\xa0100 m deep and about 2 km long and was likely created during the last ice age. I dug it because it gave me multiple opportunities to be really foolish and hang around the edge of things, something I have a habit of doing (which, if you watch my snapchat with any regularity, you already know: @krislikewhaat).''A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Oct 6, 2015 at 7:06am PDT''There were tons of places to stop along the drive, so we did just that, enjoying our first day of sunshine. Next thing I knew, we rounded a curve and there was a giant glacier, and stretching out from under it, a black sand sea that stretched onwards for miles to the horizon.''The Ring Road''A random stop along the Ring Road''The first peek of a glacier''Not mad about that gorgeous waterfall and the fall leaves!''Svartifoss adorned in gold''Maksim asked me what I’d do if I saw northern lights over the glacier lagoon that night as I frowned at the cloud cover above. I told him I could die happy if that happened and an hour later, he called me outside and there they were:''Struggled with the focus here but as you’ll see later in the post my photography improved 😉''Maps:''Skógafoss'',''Fjaðrárgljúfur'', the Black Waterfall (''Svartifoss''),''Jökulsárlón Iceberg lagoon''Camp:''We arrived at the\xa0Jökulsárlón Iceberg lagoon just after dark and were worried when we didn’t see any camping options. Luckily after''checking their website''it turned out camping is allowed in a contained camper van or RV. Score!''Day Four: The Eastern Fjords''Maksim and I woke up to a glorious sunrise. It was the first we’d seen in days due to the rain but it made up for the inclement weather in the highlands when a rainbow arced down to the glacier lagoon.''The Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon''The rainbow''This was a big driving day for us. There was a lot that we wanted to see in the north and the aurora forecast looked bleak due to cloud cover everywhere with the exception of a spot over 445km away. We wanted to see them again and figured it was our best chance. We turned out to be happily, gloriously correct.''The Eastern Fjords are lovely, and I suggest stopping whenever you see something beautiful for a photo or even taking little detours from the Ring Road for some of the coastal towns. We didn’t feel we had time for that (as it was we barely made it back to Reykjavik within the seven days we allotted), so we stuck to the Ring Road.''Gorgeous ponies in the Eastern Fjords''There’s a lot you can do that we missed out on, such as''ice cave trekking'', which\xa0was booked out way farther in advance than I’d bargained for, or helicopter tours of the active volcanoes, but the nature of the Ring Road trip is that you’ll have to pick and choose – you can’t do it all.''That night before the sun had even fully set, the northern lights came out and started dancing. The sky was completely clear and dark, giving us a dazzling display that beat out the first night’s, snaking across the sky and dancing like lines of classical music across the pages of a hauntingly enchanting song. How else can I describe it? It brought tears to my eyes.''Spotted them again!''I had to stand reallllly still for this one (20-second exposure)''Map:''Asbyrgi''Camp:''Asbyrgi has awesome camp grounds equipped with showers, sinks, clean bathrooms, and places to charge your electronics.''Day Five: Hiking\xa0Ásbyrgi Canyon''Most of day five was spent on foot rather than in a car, which was a welcome change from the day before which was quite the opposite.''Maksim and I elected to do the A8 trail, which takes you to the canyon view from the top and over to the river on the other side, spanning 12 kilometers. The trail was marked as red which means “difficult” but honestly I don’t know what whoever ranked that trail was smoking (''a lot of weed'', apparently), because the trail wasn’t difficult at all, and even those with limited fitness could do it.''Ásbyrgi, Iceland, looks so much better in the Fall''Beautiful thanks to the fall foliage''Just after the turnoff for the A8 – a worthwhile detour if the colors are changing in the trees as they were for us''What I loved about it was an aerial view of the fall foliage below, plus landscape that seriously looked like the moon. The middle part was my favorite, feeling like an astronaut for an hour, followed by fields that were so red and orange, they appeared to be on fire.''Seriously? Have we landed on the moon?''What? Where?''Didn’t expect that my red jacket would make me blend in!''If you have time to do this and enjoy hiking, definitely squeeze it in.''Maps:''Husavik''Camp:''The drive from there to the campgrounds at Húsavík is a quick one, so take a dip at the bath house in the town and enjoy the evening.''Day Six: Whale Watching in\xa0Húsavík,\xa0Chasing Waterfalls (Godafoss and\xa0Aldeyjarfoss – 4×4 needed), and Checking Out the Rock in\xa0Hvitserkur''Whale watching is a popular activity in Húsavík mostly because the chances of seeing them are around 97-99%, so might as well, right?''The whale!''Another boat out at sea''The tour we took''was around €75 and took three hours and we were able to see a Humpback Whale come up and swim around several times before heading back to the harbor. From there, Maksim and I went waterfall chasing:''Godafoss''We took the 4×4 for another spin on a road that is closed off to normal vehicles, because we wanted to check out what was poised to be the coolest waterfall of all with even more basalt columns than Svartifoss has:''Amazing Aldeyjarfoss''This is\xa0Aldeyjarfoss, which was my favorite waterfall in Iceland. This, plus the highlands, definitely justified getting the 4×4 version of our camper van.''Can you spot Maksim? He’s insane''Without much of an idea where to head after that, we checked in with Instagram again and discovered Hvitserkur, a rock in the ocean that looked cool enough to check out.''That night ended up having the most active auroras of all, which I took a couple quick pictures of but then elected to just watch and enjoy:''Hvitserkur and the lights''They looked like fingers reaching across the sky!''Maps:''Godafoss'',''Aldeyjarfoss'',''Hvitserkur''Camp:''We spent the night at Hvitserkur, which I think is a no-no, but we didn’t have much choice after arriving long after dark and spotting the northern lights again which we, naturally, had to stay and stare at.''Day Seven: More Waterfalls (and a Return to Reykjavik)''Black sand beach''Day seven involved a couple more detours in order to see more amazing waterfalls before finishing up the trip and heading back to Reykjavik.''We found Barnafoss on Instagram and wanted to take the chance to see if it still had the fall colors we’d seen from a couple weeks prior:''Beautiful Barnafoss''It added another hour or so to the trip and we were glad, once again, to have a car that could handle some back country roads when we took a short cut to get there.''Next, we elected to make the several-hour detour to see our final waterfall of Iceland, Kirkjufellsfoss:''The mountain that made the falls famous''Gorgeous kirkjufellsfoss''It was the cherry on top of a perfect Iceland Ring Road trip.''One to habitually look a gift horse in the mouth, I wondered, will Iceland ruin everything that comes after it? Will anything be impressive to me ever again? Of course it’s impossible as each country has its own special and unique beauty, but in Iceland, it’s easy to forget that anything else exists, you’re so wrapped up in the sights before you.''I hope you find these tips helpful and if you take this trip, let me know!''More Tips:''How to Photograph Iceland''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''That we leave our homes, that we step through our doors to the world, that we travel our whole lives not because we want to collect exotic T-shirts, […] but because it has the power to renew us—not the guarantee, not the promise, just the possibility. Because there are places our imaginations can never construct for us, and there are people who we will never meet but we could and we might. It reminds us that there is always a reason to begin again.''― Stephen Markley,''Tales of Iceland''It’s a bit tough to put Iceland into words. Some call it the land of fire and ice, but they’re leaving out a big part of it – the greenery, the changing colors, the wild seas, the black sand beaches, rainbows, painted mountains, the thousands upon thousands of waterfalls all over the country, and most importantly for me, the green lights in the sky.''It gets to the point as you road trip through Iceland that you finally just stop pointing waterfalls\xa0out and learn that you can’t pull over every time you see a photo opportunity because you simply wouldn’t get farther than 30 or so kilometers in one day if you did. It’s that stunning.''I visited Iceland in October and it was the perfect time for several reasons: The weather was mild, the amount of daylight and nighttime was almost equal, and the fall colors blanketed the ground and covered the trees.''It left me wondering if I’d ruined the rest of the travels that lay ahead of me, simply because I might have already visited the most beautiful country on earth. Its official name is Iceland, but to me, it was Narnia.''Here are ten photos to prove it, along with the camera settings so that you can replicate them:''Spotting the Northern Lights''Spotted them thrice''One big reason to visit Iceland in October was the opportunity to see the aurora borealis (Northern lights). In the summer, there’s hardly any darkness and in the winter, there’s hardly any daylight which really limits daytime activities. The shoulder season turned out to be a perfect combination of night and day.''Lifting some''tips from Expert Vagabond'', the plan was to have as much flexibility as possible. My buddy, Maksim, and I did this by renting a camper van and''checking out the aurora forecast''before we decided which direction to head in for our week-long Ring Road trip. We planned so that we’d have the best possible chance for clear and dark skies.''It paid off, and we got three nights of auroa activity at a level 5, which is high. The way it swirled and danced across the sky was spectacular, and it really was as bright as you see in the photo above.''The camera must be completely still for such a long exposure so get a tripod and remote or use your phone as the remote. Also, keep in mind that a wide-angle lens is generally much better for night photography, as you can get much more of the sky in the frame.''Even if it’s not as bright for you, with the right camera settings, you can still photograph it.

That was just fine with me, as I had started to get a bit jaded about the buy-buy-buy nature of the holidays\xa0and had started to be more team Grinch than team Santa.''Last\xa0year, as part of a freelance project I was working on, I traveled all around Germany’s Christmas markets from small towns to big ones, from medieval-style markets to modern ones selling modern wares.''Somewhere between the mulled wine and gingerbread, I started to love Christmas again. These 7\xa0cities all have awesome markets that are each quite unique and boast their own special themes. Bonus: I’ll bet you’ve never heard of most of them!''Hattingen''Hattingen is the first Christmas market I’ve ever been to. It was also the smallest, but what I loved about it was the traditions kept alive throughout the town. Each hour, a woman dressed as Frau Holle shakes out a pillow case which is meant to symbolize snow falling. It did result in a bunch of feathers stuck in the cracks of the cobblestone sidewalk, but the kids around town sure loved it!''Hattingen Christmas market’s wares''What I found Particularly appealing was the friendliness of the locals, including the operator of the merry-go-round who humored me and my''giant Hungarian friend''by letting us take a ride around.

How could that not leave a lasting impression?''Glühwein, in a boot!''The giant and me''Essen''Essen’s light display is what I’ll remember most about the Christmas market.

In what was the smallest town visited on this trip, this particular market has a medieval theme. Everything from juggling performers, harpsichord players and fortune tellers were about, all dressed to the theme.''Renaissance-era tea anyone?''Loved the performances as well''It felt a bit like a Christmas-themed renaissance fair, with whole pigs roasting over spit-fires, mulled wine served in clay mugs, and hollowed out cow horns and flower garlands for sale. As a kid, I would have loved this place to pieces, and as an adult, I still had a profound appreciation for it. Apparently at night, the market is decorated with candles. Out of all the markets, this one had the most unique theme.''Cologne''Given it’s a big city with lots of famous markets, prepare for crowds in Cologne. That said, the biggest and best Christmas tree I saw, framed by the beautiful Kölner Dom (Cologne Cathedral), made for such an impressive sight that this one sticks out in my mind the most.''For your festive Pinterest board!''When pigs fly''A toy maker sits behind his wares''Loved these gorgeous ornaments''Plenty of markets are within walking distance of each other, making it an easy place to do some Christmas market hopping. Some are chocolate themed, some are elf-themed, and some are a bit more modern, selling practical Christmas gifts and beautiful ornaments, though you can expect to pay a price premium on such things.''Aachen''Famous for gingerbread, Aachen was easily my favorite Christmas market, not to mention town in general. The market is famous for having the best gingerbread in all of Germany – at least that’s what they say. I thought it full of really good food and to me, it actually had the best mulled wine. It’s pretty easy to access my heart via gingerbread and mulled wine so I was a happy girl!''Mmmmulled wine in Aachen''A view of the beautiful market and Aachen Dom from city hall''Twinkling Christmas ornaments''Loved the garlands''What really blew me away was the cathedral in town, covered in golden mosaics and impossibly high and intricate stained glass windows.

It was lovely.''Düppenweiler''This little town is probably not on the radar of very many (if any?) tourists. It’s a tiny market but what struck me was how incredibly proud the locals are of their heritage. It’s a former mining town with a little tour of the mines put on by local volunteers.''What made it stand out for me was the procession called the''Mettenschicht –''a''name given to the last shift worked before Christmas. Town locals dressed up in olden-style clothing and marched up a tall, spinning, circular structure that stood at the end of the Miner’s wintermarkt. Then they proceeded to the old church and closed with a speech and feast.''The small miner’s market''The adorable church''I also couldn’t believe how sweet the locals were. When I went to purchase a mulled wine they insisted that I try it for free, along with a flaming gold shot of a “local spirit.”''If you went here without speaking with the locals and/or attending the ceremony, you might wonder why I listed this one, but thanks to how willing they were to involve foreigners, I was touched and this one really stands out.''See the blue flame!?

I used it for nearly four years before upgrading. It seems expensive, but at $100/year, actually isn’t costly at all considering how much use I got out of it.''This spring, I upgraded to a''Sony A6000''and my photo game upgraded with it. This is a more compact, mirrorless camera and I bought it because almost all of my favorite photographers also use it. Here are the differences I’ve noticed with it:''WAY more functions''This camera has an almost limitless amount of ways to shoot awesome photos, time lapses, selfies, long exposure, and night shots.''Better in low light''I knew that I wanted to try to photograph the Northern Lights this year (and I did!) and for that, I needed a camera that could handle low-light situations better.\xa0The ISO levels (what helps to shoot better in low-light situations) are literally 100 times higher than what my old Nikon could shoot.''WiFi capabilities''I can shoot photos on this camera using my phone as a remote control. That means if it’s a selfie and I’m far away, I can see what I’m shooting. If I want to take a long-exposure shot where it’s best not to touch the camera and make it shake, I don’t need a remote, I can just use my phone instead. If I want a photo right away, I can download it from my camera to my phone right then and there.''All kinds of fun programs''Thanks to the WiFi capabilities, there are things like a touchless remote, phone capabilities, time-lapse programs, and all kinds of apps\xa0I haven’t even tested out yet that I can download onto this camera. Some are paid, but most are free.''Way higher megapixels''My old camera was 12 megapixels, and this one is 24.3. The amount of detail I get with this camera is unreal compared to my last one.''My back is happier''Since this camera is so compact and light, it’s way easier to travel, and especially hike, with.''I bought a''bundle package''when I purchased the camera which includes filters, a telephoto lens, and extra batteries and chargers. It’s worth it if you intend on shooting wildlife, portraits, or long exposure shots during the day.''Wide-angle lens''London long exposure + wide angle lens''Without a wide-angle, it wouldn’t have been possible to get the whole mountain and the falls at this waterfall in Iceland''A view of the Matterhorn plus sorroundings, and a cool cloud effect''The photos above wouldn’t have been possible without a''wide-angle lens''to capture the entire scene. I’ve come to find that time and time again, the wide angle makes photos look way more interesting because it allows for extra detail in the photo that is normally cut off of the sides. It captures what your eye sees plus the periphery.''I used to wonder what photographers were using that could so naturally drive my line of sight right to the focal point\xa0of a photo. Now I realize this is the secret sauce, so to speak, for getting an all-encompassing shot. The lens creates a cool warped effect around the sides (that can be edited out later if needed)\xa0that makes clouds look like they’re stretching out into space.''The lens cost as much as the camera – as most nonstandard\xa0lenses do – but I’m so glad that I have it and use it almost as often as I used my standard lens.''GoPro''These were taken in South Africa and Singapore with a''GoPro''.''It took this''And this (Singapore)''Speaking of wide-angles, the GoPro has an even wider, fish-eye lens that is perfect for a natural curve in the landscape like the top photo, or when you need to get a lot into one photo, like the Singapore super trees.''Plus, if you’re not sure about photo settings, especially in low-light, the GoPro adjusts for you and takes awesome photos regardless of the light situation.''I also love it for underwater or half-out-of-water photography:''Taken at the blue lagoon in Iceland''Out of all the other cameras and lenses I have, it’s the cheapest but also the most resilient. When in snowy or wet situations, I leave the other cameras at home and just bring this one.''Plus, with the new GoPro app, even''with my older model''I can still see what the lens sees by taking it with my phone, which makes selfies possible too!''My only qualm is the battery life. It’s awful. I put up with it because the camera takes such cool photos and is usable in situations when I can’t use my others, but consider purchasing an extra battery if you intend to use the camera all day without an opportunity to charge (though I have found a''portable charger''helps combat the issue).''Tripod + Remote''If you want to take long exposure shots, you really need a tripod. I resisted for years because I didn’t want a heavy tripod along, but then I realized that it let me do so much more with my photography, so I opted for a light one.''Amazon sells one for around $24''that isn’t heavy at all. It’s the one I use and would recommend.''A long exposure selfie taken with a tripod in Iceland''If you want to take a selfie, you can either use a timer or a remote with the tripod. You can use your phone as a remote but mine is huge, and I don’t really want it in the photo if I’m close to the camera like in the photo above. I usually use a small,''cheap remote''.''Composition and shooting techniques''Take the basics into account''Shoot your images in RAW format, aim for golden hour, learn how to get out of the automatic setting, and look for symmetry. those are the basics that just about every photography article talks about.

If he/she paid for an expensive camera, chances are better that he/she learned how to use it properly. This person is also unlikely to run off with your camera if she already has one herself. Best practice is to offer to take a photo for that person before asking. Maybe she’ll even offer back without you needing to ask!''Ask them to hold it in that exact position''and take it for you. Compose the shot before you even ask, and tell them exactly what you plan to do in it so that all of the artistic direction is already dictated by you and not by them.''Ask someone else''if the first time isn’t to your liking. Politely wait for that person to walk away, then try again. It takes an extra five minutes but might result in the perfect photo.''Timer settings and remotes''Part of getting over feeling weird in photos for me was just to take them of myself until I got comfortable with being in front of the camera. If someone else is taking my photo I immediately look less natural.

I used it for nearly four years before upgrading. It seems expensive, but at $100/year, actually isn’t costly at all considering how much use I got out of it.''This spring, I upgraded to a''Sony A6000''and my photo game upgraded with it. This is a more compact, mirrorless camera and I bought it because almost all of my favorite photographers also use it. Here are the differences I’ve noticed with it:''WAY more functions''This camera has an almost limitless amount of ways to shoot awesome photos, time lapses, selfies, long exposure, and night shots.''Better in low light''I knew that I wanted to try to photograph the Northern Lights this year (and I did!) and for that, I needed a camera that could handle low-light situations better.\xa0The ISO levels (what helps to shoot better in low-light situations) are literally 100 times higher than what my old Nikon could shoot.''WiFi capabilities''I can shoot photos on this camera using my phone as a remote control. That means if it’s a selfie and I’m far away, I can see what I’m shooting. If I want to take a long-exposure shot where it’s best not to touch the camera and make it shake, I don’t need a remote, I can just use my phone instead. If I want a photo right away, I can download it from my camera to my phone right then and there.''All kinds of fun programs''Thanks to the WiFi capabilities, there are things like a touchless remote, phone capabilities, time-lapse programs, and all kinds of apps\xa0I haven’t even tested out yet that I can download onto this camera. Some are paid, but most are free.''Way higher megapixels''My old camera was 12 megapixels, and this one is 24.3. The amount of detail I get with this camera is unreal compared to my last one.''My back is happier''Since this camera is so compact and light, it’s way easier to travel, and especially hike, with.''I bought a''bundle package''when I purchased the camera which includes filters, a telephoto lens, and extra batteries and chargers.

I’ve come to find that time and time again, the wide angle makes photos look way more interesting because it allows for extra detail in the photo that is normally cut off of the sides. It captures what your eye sees plus the periphery.''I used to wonder what photographers were using that could so naturally drive my line of sight right to the focal point\xa0of a photo. Now I realize this is the secret sauce, so to speak, for getting an all-encompassing shot. The lens creates a cool warped effect around the sides (that can be edited out later if needed)\xa0that makes clouds look like they’re stretching out into space.''The lens cost as much as the camera – as most nonstandard\xa0lenses do – but I’m so glad that I have it and use it almost as often as I used my standard lens.''GoPro''These were taken in South Africa and Singapore with a''GoPro''.''It took this''And this (Singapore)''Speaking of wide-angles, the GoPro has an even wider, fish-eye lens that is perfect for a natural curve in the landscape like the top photo, or when you need to get a lot into one photo, like the Singapore super trees.''Plus, if you’re not sure about photo settings, especially in low-light, the GoPro adjusts for you and takes awesome photos regardless of the light situation.''I also love it for underwater or half-out-of-water photography:''Taken at the blue lagoon in Iceland''Out of all the other cameras and lenses I have, it’s the cheapest but also the most resilient. When in snowy or wet situations, I leave the other cameras at home and just bring this one.''Plus, with the new GoPro app, even''with my older model''I can still see what the lens sees by taking it with my phone, which makes selfies possible too!''My only qualm is the battery life. It’s awful. I put up with it because the camera takes such cool photos and is usable in situations when I can’t use my others, but consider purchasing an extra battery if you intend to use the camera all day without an opportunity to charge (though I have found a''portable charger''helps combat the issue).''Tripod + Remote''If you want to take long exposure shots, you really need a tripod. I resisted for years because I didn’t want a heavy tripod along, but then I realized that it let me do so much more with my photography, so I opted for a light one.''Amazon sells one for around $24''that isn’t heavy at all. It’s the one I use and would recommend.''A long exposure selfie taken with a tripod in Iceland''If you want to take a selfie, you can either use a timer or a remote with the tripod.

Mom and I decided to change\xa0that this summer when I came back for a visit. The starting point was L.A. (though you could start in sunny San Diego which is about two hours south), with plans to make it to Santa Barbara, where I went to college, by mid-afternoon.''El Capitan Campgrounds, Santa Barbara''Happy. Just in my swim shorts, barefooted, wild-haired, in the red fire dark, singing, swigging wine, spitting, jumping, running—that’s the way to live. All alone and free in the soft sands of the beach by the sigh of the sea out there –''Dharma Bums''Though uncharacteristically dry due to a 4-year drought, it’s still beautiful''I got goosebumps when I read this quote about the Santa Barbara coast while sitting half a world away on''Tonsai beach in Thailand''. I felt exactly what Jack was talking about as he referenced the place where I went to univeristy, came into my own, and realized what I wanted out of life. It was never clearer to me than when I was sitting on those quiet beaches outside of Santa Barbara, looking up at the stars, listening to the gentle roll of the waves, and thanking the universe for creating such a beautiful place.''Jack was speaking of Gaviota State Beach, which is just a few campsites over from''El Capitan'', a favorite of mine located just north of Santa Barbara on PCH. The campgrounds are located directly on cliffs overlooking the ocean, and every single time I’ve looked out at the horizon, I’ve seen dolphins within minutes. That is not hyperbole.''Every single time!''A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Aug 21, 2015 at 8:42pm PDT''Once you leave El Capitan for the next day’s drive, there are tons of places worth stopping by on the way up to Big Sur, and they only get more spectacular as you make your way north. The Morro Bay rock is one, and as you make your way up through San Simeon you’ll see more and more lovely\xa0views which almost always have space for pulling off the road for a quick photo:''How cute is my mom?''You can’t really go wrong with which beach\xa0you choose to stop for lunch at – though Pismo Beach is a popular spot if you need suggestions. We elected to stop a bit before that\xa0in San Louis Obispo (at''Old San Luis BBQ Company''which will make you fat but it will be worth it).''Remember these guys from National Geographic? Elephant seals love the California coast!''Free as a bird''Big Sur''On soft Spring nights I’ll stand in the yard under the stars – Something good will come out of all things yet – And it will be golden and eternal just like that – There’s no need to say another word. –''Big Sur''Big Sur’s famous spot for whale watching, just north of Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park''Though Jack’s work,''Big Sur'', spoke of his battle with alcohol addiction and finally succumbing to its grasp, his words in this quote remind me of the way I often feel when staring off into the distance. Things finally start to align when I’m given the time and space to think close to nature’s heart, far from big cities, crowds, and skyscrapers.''There’s something about staring at the California coastal horizon and imagining the possibilities that exist out there that result in the kind of clarity I can’t find elsewhere. I imagine he might have felt the same.''Ventana <3''Hot dogs – a camping staple amiright?''Big Sur is one of California’s most famous parks, and usually books up well in advance, yet I got lucky by finding''Ventana Campground''(location noted in the map at the bottom of the post), which is a tranquil, tents-only campground in the middle of a patch of Redwood trees.''If you’ve never seen them before, prepare to be wowed.''The world’s oldest trees''Humbled''The Redwood tree only exists in California, Oregon, and China’s Hubei province. The first spot you’ll see them driving up the coast from Southern California is in Big Sur, and my, what a sight they are.''The world’s tallest known living tree, named the Hyperion in Northern California, is of the Redwood variety and stands at\xa0115.61\xa0m (379.3\xa0ft). It’s incredible to imagine how resilient these trees are, as the average age of Redwoods is 500-700 years, with some living as much as 2000-2500 years!''Their fire-retardant bark and the way it splinters into tiny pieces when it hits the ground have helped them survive fires and logging, though they still are victim to both. Thankfully, conservation efforts in California have protected some of the areas where they grow.''McWay Falls – a gorgeous spot you don’t even need to hike to''McWay Falls has a beautiful history. It’s right outside of\xa0Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park (park on the right side of the road if coming from the north in order to avoid paying park entrance fees if all you want to do is quickly see the falls).''The land where the park now sits was owned by an heiress Helen Chamblet Hooper, who married Lathrop Brown, a one term Congressman. McWay Falls is named after McWay Canyon, which was named for the first homesteader Christopher McWay who settled there in 1887.''Would you, could you go to Bixby Bridge without taking an obligatory selfie?''Upon leaving Big Sur to head north keep your eyes open for the famous Bixby Bridge, which will be easy to spot as it’s a favorite amongst tourists for a quick photo.''Carmel By The Sea''Keep an eye on maps, as just south\xa0of Carmel-By-The-Sea, you’ll see a bunch of old trees lining the road and a few more cars pulled over. Stop to see if you can spot some whales from the shore. Much like the density of dolphins around El Capitan, spending some time scanning the water for clouds of mist from a blowhole may pay off. Mom and I saw two without binoculars.''If you’ve got time, the 17 Mile Drive between Carmel and Monterrey is a famous and beautiful one (but will set you back $15).''San Francisco''It seemed like a matter of minutes when we began rolling in the foothills before Oakland and suddenly reached a height and saw stretched out ahead of us the fabulous white city of San Francisco on her eleven mystic hills with the blue Pacific and its advancing wall of potato-patch fog beyond, and smoke and goldenness in the late afternoon of time. –''On the Road''That bridge we all know and love, as photographed from Baker Beach, a nudist beach''There’s one spot in San Francisco where you can actually camp –''Kirby Cove''– and it has a view of the iconic Golden Gate bridge.''SF, as we Californians call it, is always a favorite of mine not because I go sight seeing at Fisherman’s Wharf, California’s old prison at Alcatraz Island, hang from cable cars or even wine taste.''It’s where nearly all of my best friends live now, and every time I go back, I’m reminded who my family away from my family is, and it’s a beautiful feeling.''Rainbow unicorns unite''Fishermen on Baker Beach''San Francisco has a great vibe with a great many\xa0cultures coming together. I personally love poking around Haight and Ashbury, or lounging in one of the parks. If you want to go for a walk and catch some nature and coastal views,\xa0go for a walk along the Presidio.''South Lake Tahoe''I felt like lying down by the side of the trail and remembering it all. The woods do that to you, they always look familiar, long lost, like the face of a long-dead relative, like an old dream, like a piece of forgotten song drifting across the water, most of all like golden eternities of past childhood or past manhood and all the living and the dying and the heartbreak that went on a million years ago and the clouds as they pass overhead seem to testify (by their own lonesome familiarity) to this feeling.\xa0–''Dharma Bums''Beautiful South Lake Tahoe''I know it’s a deviation from the coastal road trip to hit up Lake Tahoe, but it’s so worth it. I couldn’t believe I’d never seen it before having grown up in this state, and as I’ve come to find, there’s a lot worth seeing in my own backyard.''Though I didn’t hit South Lake Tahoe on the same road trip, it’s easy enough to make the jaunt over if you have the time. I drove up there several weeks later en route to Burning Man with a few friends, and this time, we took an RV.''It’s certainly different camping with an RV, and I love it for the convenience. Once you get over the initial,''omigod this is huge how do I even drive this boat?!''it’s not so bad, and can even be kind of fun to drive.''Lovely Tahoe''We camped at''Fallen Leaf Campground''in South Lake Tahoe, which at the time was not permitting fires due to the dryness induced by California’s current 4-year drought. No matter, because we had a stove, and even an oven, right inside the RV.''Me driving the Minnie Winnie (Like a trucker, I might add)''One big reason we had the RV was for Burning Man (covered in''The Day I Finally Became Enough'', if you’re curious about the desert festival). I would honestly never go to Burning Man without an RV. I sleep at odd times during the festival and tents turn into ovens during the day. Sleep is too important during a week-long festival, as are showers. It also provides good shelter from the crazy dust storms and a place to hang out, store costumes and get ready for the day, and to cook easily. I normally don’t mind roughing it, but during Burning Man is one time that I’m just not willing to.''The Winnie in Lake Tahoe''The gorgeous interior''In the past we had rented from someone off of Craig’s List, and this year, went with''Apollo RVs''instead. I didn’t realize what I had been missing. The old RV leaked water constantly and we had a crisis almost every year, which is very bad news when you’re at a festival in the desert where you can’t refill. It also had nice hard floors rather than the ridiculous carpet in the last one, and looked pretty classy inside with all the dark wood. I’ve learned my lesson here – go for the newer models that aren’t going to break super easily.''Camper van photos thanks to my lovely partner in crime, Yvonne.

Take a walk along any of the beaches, especially at sunset, and\xa0you’ll feel a profound connection to the coast in a way you haven’t felt at any other spot – that’s a promise.''Moonstone Beach''The California road trip is one I’ve wanted to do my whole life, and I can’t believe it took me traveling to the ends of the world to finally make the time for my home state.''I can only close with gratitude, and with yet another passage from Jack Kerouac:''And I said, “God, I love you” and looked to the sky and really meant it. “I have fallen in love with you, God. Take care of us all, one way or the other.” To the children and the innocent it’s all the same. –''Dharma Bums''Camping Tips''Directions:''Click here for a map''with all of the destinations plotted out for an easier journey.''Camp Food:''For easy eating, I suggest hobo stew, which is a mix of veggies (I like to put squash, zucchini, broccoli and/or cauliflower, and tomato in mine, layered in that order), plus ground turkey, beef, chicken, or pork, BBQ sauce on a large square of tin foil. Scrunch it up around the sides and pour in a bit of whiskey then throw it on the grill and, depending on how big the fire is and how quickly the veggies cook, you’ll have an easy meal within 30 minutes to an hour.''MMMM boy! Hobo Stew for the win''All you really need to make this is a cutting board, decent knife, and a campground that will allow camp fires. Sometimes, especially due to the recent drought, they’re not allowed, so look on the campground’s website to be sure.''Fill up on gas before getting near Big Sur:''It gets hideously expensive in national parks''Book ahead:''Camp slots in California, especially in the summer, book up way ahead of time. Get your spot early!''Get an awesome tent for tent-only campgrounds:''Mom did a great job of making our''4-person tent''(for two people, naturally) feel like a palace. We each had our own''twin air mattresses''(which I suggest over one queen because if one person moves the other feels it too much on a queen),''thick sleeping bags''(it gets cold at night, especially on the coast, at any time of year), and a nice big tent that was easy to put up. I slept like a baby.''For the comforts of home, get an RV:''Most of the time, I’d much rather have an RV if possible for long road trips like these. Setting up camp takes up a lot of time, especially when moving quickly, and in an RV, not only do you have more people and more potential drivers, but there’s a spot for cooking if campfires are not allowed, an oven, showers, a toilet, and an essential for Burning Man – air conditioning.''*Apollo and I collaborated to bring you this post\xa0(Two other bloggers and I provided them with\xa0photos of the RV\xa0for their marketing purposes).

Not the person who is sitting across from me based on outward appearances, or a persona that he or she gives off – I can see that already. But if I really want to know the''soul''of the person, I ask that question.''I want to know, before anyone told her, “no, it’s impossible” or the burden of adulthood expectations\xa0sunk in, what that incredible dream was.''A strange thing usually happens. A smile spreads\xa0across the person’s\xa0face, and then the\xa0eyes start to look glassy as she remembers the tiny version of herself, with that little voice and those great big dreams. Without any reason to believe it couldn’t be true, or any obstacles to harden her\xa0yet, she dreamed what later seemed the impossible dream.''Except it’s not the impossible dream, because if your mind can conceive of it, then it can be made so.''Almost every kid had something he loved to do. It was the very thing he’d spend hours on without any concept of ‘why’ he was doing it. There was no end game. He just did it. It was his love.''I remember this the most vividly with my cousin, Michael. When he loved something, oh boy did he love it. He ate, slept, and breathed it. The first obsession of his that I can recall was trains. He learned everything he could about them. He played with toy trains constantly, decorated his room in trains, drew them on paper, and pored over books that were about nothing but trains. His passion as he grew up was always to figure out the way that things worked, and today, he’s an engineer.''Michael’s lucky, he kept his dream.''But sometimes I wonder how many people dreamed a\xa0dream only to believe later that it wasn’t possible.''How many childhood artists grew up to start selling medical products over the phone to buyers whose face they’d never seen? How many little magicians with little top hats thought, “there’s no way I can survive doing that!”, and threw in the towel? How many people honestly, genuinely, dreamed of becoming a tech consultant from age six?''Start planning your adventure now!''At what point does the dream die? At what point do we stop being''children on the playground'', asking each other questions that aren’t loaded, playing games that aren’t for keeps, without any hidden agendas other than, would you like to climb on the jungle gym and play spider man right here and right now?''I don’t mean to say\xa0that anyone who didn’t follow that childhood dream failed, or that there’s any reason not to take pride in the work that you pour your soul into. All I want to know is, when you check in with your inner child, the one who never judged you, told you that you couldn’t do it, or looked in the mirror and said, “can’t”, is she happy?''Namibia’s Dune 45''Three years ago, I came to find that I answered that question with a ‘no’ too many days in a row. It scared the hell out of me, but I finally decided to listen to little 6-year-old Kristin, and now I realize something beautiful:''When you come to find that the inner child was right all along, when you start to listen to the gentle, playful voice within rather than the criticisms from outside, it’ll all start to make sense. All of the heartbreaks, the slammed doors, the closed chapters and the painful goodbyes will fall in line and the past will be past, because it all contributed to advancing you right to where you are now, and ‘now’ will finally feel right.''Even if you still have dreams you haven’t reached yet, (don’t we all?), know that even steps that felt like they were taking you backwards were still getting you to a essential pivotal point. That point is here and now. And I hope that if your here and now does not satisfy that inner child that you will have the courage to\xa0start again. There are no rules to this crazy ride called life, only the conductor, and that’s you.''I’m not saying that it will be easy, and making any change can be terrifying, but just like when you still went to sleep even though there were\xa0monsters under the bed, you can find the courage again. Listen to that little voice more. S/he always knew you best.''It’s more important to be free''If\xa0you’re wondering what my answer to the question was, to me, it was simple.''I wanted to be a unicorn.''Of course, a person cannot physically turn into a mythical horse. I came to realize that eventually.''But it wasn’t the physical characteristics of a unicorn that made me so enamored and obsessed with\xa0becoming one. It was everything that a unicorn represents – magic, mystique, and resilience. Even though people grow older and say they don’t exist, they still manage to live on\xa0in children’s minds. They sure did in mine.''There’s no reason why I can’t still strive to be a unicorn each and every day.''That’s why in case I need a reminder, she’s right there on my hat.''Rainbow unicorns forever''So, what did you want to be when you were little, mini, tiny you?''—''Further reading:''The books that changed my point of view'',''Conquering Mountains: How to Solo Travel the World Fearlessly'', “''What if money was no object?''“, and''An Awesome Book''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''What is Living the Dream, Exactly?

That’s part of the reason why I started traveling – I thought it would solve everything.''Then I realized that the problems I had at home showed up on the road, too.

Constant stimulation had morphed into\xa0monotony, and the things that previously kept me engaged lost\xa0their luster. My friend, Stephanie, who is working on her PhD in cellular biology (and is a self-proclaimed atheist) recommended this book to me. I was surprised,''why are you of all people recommending a religious text to me?''It turned out that''What Makes You Not a Buddhist''isn’t much of a religious text at all, but rather an innovative explanation of the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism to someone from a modern Western background.''Powerful passage:''“Most of the time we are trying to make the good things last, or we are thinking about replacing them with something even better in the future, or we are sunk in the past, reminiscing about happier times. Ironically, we never truly appreciated the experience for which we are nostalgic because we were too busy clinging to our hopes and fears at the time.”''The takeaways:''My biggest realizations came from early on in the book when Khysentse\xa0discussed impermanence. He asked tough questions about the value of possessions and good looks\xa0when these things always break down and disappear.''What is the point was of attaching value to things that don’t endure? He also talked about the nature of change, and that everything is in a state of flux. Once I realized that, I also realized that the down times would eventually vanish, and that I should accept that good times would, too. Once you can truly embrace change, it becomes much harder to rock you.''This is the book that changed my life the most, and the one that I suggest to any friends going through a transitionary period.''The Art of Happiness in a Troubled World''by Howard Cutler, M.D. and His Holiness the Dalai Lama''After learning about Buddhism, and the very difficult concept that “all emotions are pain,” I had to know why another Buddhist monk would discuss how to be happy. I was pleasantly surprised to find that, in this series of conversations between Dr. Cutler and the Dalai Lama, that the aim was to find inner peace by realizing that what happens is perception, and that compassion heals all.''One of the most powerful conversations dealt with\xa0how the Dalai Lama feels\xa0towards the Chinese after his exile from Tibet. He says that feels\xa0compassion towards them so that he doesn’t feel hatred. Each time he encounters someone new, he thinks about what they have in common and how he can find a positive connection.\xa0We all just want to be happy, loved, and at peace.''Powerful passage:''“In general, if we carefully examine any given situation in a very unbiased and honest way, we will realize that to a large extent we are also responsible for the unfolding of events.”''My takeaways:''Every time someone wrongs me or even cuts in front of me in line, I try to find a common ground, I think about why I shouldn’t take it personally, and how it’s not about me, it’s about them. I’m far from successful at this all the time, but just checking in and taking that step sometimes rids me of anger, an emotion that is poisonous only to me.''As the Buddha said, “Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.”''Zen Pencils''By Gavin Aung''Zen Pencils is a comic website that my friend Chelsea told me about in Melbourne during month six of my travels. I was going through a tough breakup and she was missing Southeast Asia, where we’d met. Zen Pencils, also based in Melbourne, takes inspirational quotes and draws them into cartoons.''What sets Aung’s site apart from anything else inspirational that I’ve found is the quotes he chooses. Even though they can sometimes be controversial and almost always go against the status quo, they have had the power, time and time again, to change my thought process. I get goosebumps when I read some of them, and when I need to be reminded that I’m on the right path, I check in with Zen Pencils.''My takeaways:''I read Aung’s work when I need to be encouraged. It often only takes five minutes, and I feel good again. If you’re just discovering his work for the first time, I recommend these (in this order):''Alan Watts, What if Money was no Object?'',''Caitlin Moran, We’re all Dying'',''Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot'',''James Rhodes, Is that not Worth Exploring?'',''Max Ehrmann, Desiderada''.''Intimacy & Desire''by David Schnarch''I had a deep and meaningful conversation with my friend Michael during the long drive home from Burning Man after\xa0the first year of my travels wrapped up. We talked about the nature of relationships and he spoke about several theories with me, such as the truth that relationships ebb and flow and how much that can profoundly impact one’s self esteem. A few days later, he sent me a copy of this book as a gift.''While it’s\xa0mainly written for couples (regardless of sexual orientation) who are going through a rough patch, particularly sexually, I read this as a single girl with no romantic partner in mind (or even in sight) and it made a big impact. It was all about the importance of having a strong sense of self, and a purpose, which echoed the sentiments of the previous suggestions in this list.''Powerful passage:''“A solid sense of self develops from confronting yourself, challenging yourself to do what’s right, and earning your own self-respect.”''My takeaways:''I applied it not just to romantic relationships, but to every relationship in my life. I realized that if I draw my self esteem from other people, what happens when that relationship hits an ebb moment? I have to draw my\xa0self esteem from within, or I’m toast and so is that relationship.''The Six Pillars of Self Esteem''by Nathaniel Branden''I discovered this book thanks to''a blog post by Mark Manson''(I really like his''Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck'', as well). It’s the natural progression after reading Schnarch’s book (which, if you don’t feel is relevant to you, skip right to this one). This is Branden’s takeaways after a lifetime of clinical practice and study and, if you can get through it, has the potential to make a huge impact.''This book isn’t about becoming an egomaniac, it’s about taking healthy steps towards learning how to validate yourself rather than seeking it from external influences. It involves taking a hard look at yourself and to first love who you are, and then to be brutally honest about what you’re f*$king up, how to maintain integrity and assertiveness on a healthy level, and finally how to live with purpose and do things you can be proud of.''Powerful passage:''“If I am unwilling to take responsibility for the attainment of my desires, they are not really desires—they are merely daydreams.”''My takeaways:''This isn’t a ‘fun’ read. It’s more\xa0like the text book in college that you hated getting through but knew it was imparting tons of valuable information so you slogged through anyways. I would get through a chapter and just have to stop reading because my brain was buzzing. I felt like the words just weren’t getting through to me and it wasn’t sinking in. Then, I started to notice little changes in my day to day feelings and actions. I was checking in more. I was questioning my actions more. I was becoming more confident through self acceptance and confrontation.''Out of everything I’ve read apart from''What Makes You Not a Buddhist'', this book has had the greatest impact on me.''Thinking, Fast and Slow''by Daniel Khanemann''My friend Maksim suggested this one to me after I told him about the''Pillars''. We’d been having a pretty deep conversation all night in a warm and dark whiskey bar just after this most recent Christmas in Berlin, and he told me this was the book that changed his life. So naturally, I had to read it.''Thinking''is all about how the brain gets lazy and is quick to generalize so that it doesn’t have to work as hard at evaluating every little thing in life. This can be as easy as failing to recognize an optical illusion, or as hazardous as assigning values and beliefs to a person who we barely know.''Just imagine how many times you assumed something about someone only to find out that you were dead wrong after. How many friendships have been killed because someone was cold or shy at first and how many romances have died because that person wasn’t who you initially envisioned him or her\xa0to be?''Powerful passage:''“Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.”''My takeaways:''The most powerful passage for me was right at the end where Khanemann acknowledged that, even after a lifetime spent studying the brain and thought patterns, despite all that he knew,\xa0he still struggled to successfully apply it to everyday situations. It helped me let go of the frustration that I still make mistakes, but at least I’m moving towards understanding and positive change.''A New Earth''by Eckhart Tolle''You know those words on my sidebar that invite readers to let me know if they’re in the same place as I am so that we can grab a coffee? I actually meet up with readers all the time, and this recommendation came from Louise from San Francisco in a park last summer in Berlin.''Perhaps you’ve heard of Tolle’s other work,''The Power of Now''. Both books are New York Times bestsellers and for good reason. They cut through all the BS and ask you to look critically at what is honestly, seriously important in life and how you can live more purposefully.''Powerful passage:''“When you don’t cover up the world with words and labels, a sense of the miraculous returns to your life that was lost a long time ago when humanity, instead of using thought, became possessed by thought.”''My takeaways:''A New Earth echoes the sentiments of''What Makes You Not a Buddhist''and''The Six Pillars of Self Esteem''by challenging you to examine yourself and what is really important vs. what the advertising industry\xa0would have you believe is important. For someone who has never read anything about this thought process, it can lead to an awakening. For me, it reaffirmed other works I had read, reminding me of the important aspects that I had forgotten over time (and I can always use a reminder).''Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less''by Greg McKeown''Essentialism is yet another reader recommendation from the offer to meet up over coffee. Marshall emailed me over a year ago asking if I was him from the future. We graduated from the same\xa0university and he worked in the corporate world but had dreams of traveling. I was delighted when I received an email from him last September saying he was in Berlin, a city he meant to just have two days in, then decided to change his plans and stay for several months because it jived so well with him.''Given all those similarities, it was natural that I had to ask which book changed his life. This was his #1 and after reading I can see why. Essentialism is all about picking one direction and going for it wholeheartedly. Rather than trying to be everything to everyone, it’s about doing one thing incredibly well, and not apologizing for focusing only on what is important and going to make a true impact. This is helpful on so many levels, from personal to professional.''Powerful passage:''If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will.”''My takeaways:''So many things in life are trivial and don’t make enough of a contribution to take up so much time and energy. For me, that was spending any time on social media that isn’t related to my work. It can be such a time drain and it toyed with my emotions way too much, forcing me to play the comparison game. Instead, every time I wanted to go online, I checked in and asked myself what I could do instead that would be good for me. If it doesn’t have to do with work, it’s reading, painting, or taking a walk. The more I do these things, the better I feel. This ties back into the''Six Pillars of Self Esteem''as well.''Sonia Sophia''I discovered Sonia Sophia at Burning Man at my best friend and former college roommate’s urging. Sophia dresses up like a fairy and speaks incredibly gently. She\xa0conducts the\xa0sessions by asking you to tap on different pressure points on the body, not telling you how to feel or what to think, but instead asking questions, leading you into some serious introspection. They deal with ugly things in the past, making peace with things you can’t change, and letting yourself be imperfect while also achieving great things.

I am still learning and I wish I could say I’m completely enlightened, but I am closer than I ever was before. Here are some positive changes:''I talk''with''myself, not''at''myself'': I realized my internal voice was super harsh. I used to get in full-on arguments with myself (someone please tell me I’m not the only one who does that!). Then I was like, why am I doing this? The person in the world who is the meanest to me is''me''. Now, when my internal monologue turns negative I pause, check in, and change the tone''I am honest with myself about my problems and flaws'': Nobody is perfect, least of all me. I used to rationalize away the things I did that hurt other people. While I still do that from time to time, I’m more honest with myself these days. I admit the problem, forgive myself for it, then work on a solution.''I realize I’m captain of the ship:''If I’m feeling up or down, I know that’s because of my own brain. Nobody put me there, it’s just how I react to things. Life’s a ride, and I’m the driver. The perception is mine. I can steer it in any direction. That realization was incredibly freeing''I let other people be human, too:''If I’m fighting a hard battle, that must mean others are, too. Seeing that place in others that is weak or longing for acceptance allows me to have more patience when someone treats me in a way that I deem unfair. It helps me take it less personally''So what are the books and websites that have changed your lives?''I want to add to this list, and reader and friend recommendations have been huge for me.

The content and opinions expressed below are my own.''In my last post with Marriott Rewards Credit Card from Chase we talked about what''motivates travel choices''amongst different age groups. This time they asked Americans to predict how travel will change in the next 15 years.''Though 15 years doesn’t seem like all that far into the future, when I think back to the year 2000, so much has changed about travel since then. Pagers were a big thing, smart phones didn’t exist yet, if people wanted to get in contact while traveling, they probably had to find an internet café, or worse, pick up the phone and use a dreaded calling card. Facebook also didn’t exist, and Wi-Fi certainly wasn’t as widely available as it is now. E-readers hadn’t been introduced.''Back then, the Euro had only barely been introduced, so it’s fun to think about how much might completely change by the year 2030. Here are some of the things people answered when surveyed by''Marriott Rewards Credit Card''from Chase''about the future of travel:''Personal Trainers will be replaced by holograms''I smiled when I read that thirty-seven percent of those polled think a hologram of a personal trainer will eventually replace personal trainers. They are already correct, because the guy who leads the spin classes at my gym in Berlin isn’t actually a guy at all, but an electronic version of a trainer who sometimes winks at us and makes funny faces while we try not to fall off the stationary bikes (harder than it seems).''My take: I know what they mean – even when you travel, you can have a personal trainer who is always with you, but honestly, a\xa0hologram can’t replace the emotional drive offered by a fellow human being, so I hope this doesn’t catch on further by 2030.''Passports will be replaced by face recognition technology''50% of those polled believe human face recognition technology could replace passports altogether. Personally, I really don’t see why it doesn’t already. I’m in the process of figuring out when to renew my passport (and what to do about associated visas) and it’s a huge headache. This way, it’s much harder to steal anyone’s identity, the dreaded lost passport will be a thing of the past, and I can stop checking, re-checking, and triple checking that I have my passport.''My take: I’ve long thought current methods to be pretty archaic when things like retina scanners and fingerprints exist. Why are we still using a paper book? Honestly?''Travel to space will be possible''Whenever I’m asked what my top destination is, I reply with, “the moon,” and I mean it entirely because I am dying to literally get out of this world. It would feel amazing. Thirty-five percent of those surveyed believe it’s a possibility to travel to a destination in space in the next 15 years. I guess they mean other than the moon? Because for millionaires, that’s already possible.''My take: I truly, deeply hope this becomes possible, not least of all because we’re running out of room and resources on this planet and it’s time to come up with some solutions. Maybe that kind of perspective – seeing how good we have it on Earth – would be good for the human race.''Mobile travel guides will be personalized''Nearly half of those polled believe that soon, travel information won’t just come in Lonely Planet form, but will be personalized. I suppose that already exists in music technology, so why not travel technology? Of course, it’s easier, quicker, and less time consuming to hear a song and quickly give it a thumbs down or thumbs up than it is to experience a destination or activity and then say, “nah, that wasn’t for me, thumbs down.” For now, I guess travel blogs (and finding those with interests aligned with your own) are the best method for trusting whose suggestions to follow.''My take: If someone can figure out how to do this and do it well, there’s a million+ dollar opportunity out there that Marriott Rewards credit card just handed you on a silver platter.''More travelers will tap into travel rewards''This is my prediction as more travelers become aware of the benefits out there, such as the ones offered by the''Marriott Rewards Credit Card from Chase'', which lets you earn Marriott Rewards points on all purchases, accumulate free night stays and more to get the most out of your travel. Any time I have an opportunity to build up benefits by using a card instead of cash for everyday and necessary purchases, I do exactly that. It’s a great way to travel and stay for free, and nothing feels better than a (free) awesome place to lay one’s head.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''No related posts.''For the final stop on Mom and my journey''following my Grandmother’s journal''around Europe, we continued along the Alps and landed in Zermatt, Switzerland.''Why didn’t anyone tell me before that Switzerland is so dang beautiful?''This was the place Granny went into the most detail about regarding the landscape. She branched off from the group one day to explore the Matterhorn surroundings on her own, noting that the guide “hadn’t done his homework” (Mom and I couldn’t stop laughing about that, reading it to ourselves in her voice) by telling her it would be a waste of time to take a train, the Gornergrat, up to it.''The train she referenced is pretty touristy now, so that was a big change from 30 years ago when Granny took it pre-fame. Mom put the veto on that idea pretty quickly given she’s been in Zermatt before and knew it was both pricey, at about $100 per person, and way too\xa0crowded\xa0these days.''Instead, we opted to go for a hike, just like we’d done in''Heidelberg'', Innsbruck, and Ahrntal in the days before.''Edelweissweg''The beginning of the trail''It was mid-July and a hot one at that. Mom had been there just a year before around the same time and they were wearing gloves and winter jackets, but this time around, we were sweating in the hot sun and the Matterhorn had just a bit of snow left at the top.''I can’t decide which is better. Perhaps a little something in between?''What immediately made me fall in love were the wild flowers. They were just about every color one might paint a baby’s room from white to yellow, purple, pink, and blue.''Granny’s notebook''The hike can start from the town of Zermatt itself but Mom and I were staying at a cute guest house a gondola ride up at the''Hotel Silvana''in Furi. The trail goes through Zmutt, then\xa0Stafelalp, followed by\xa0Schwarzsee. (Get a good map before you set out hiking)''After a few miles of flatness you’ll come to a steep climb upwards that will peak with an incredible view of the Matterhorn. It’s a bit of a challenge but not too bad.''For your Europe Pinterest board''Timer selfie with Mom''Which way to go from here? That depends a lot on where you want to get to''Shortly thereafter, another guesthouse along the way called Hotel du Trift is the perfect spot for an apfelschorle (apple juice and sparkling water mixed together – a favorite of mine ever since''moving to Germany'') and soup with sausage in it. The owner teased us mercilessly for coming inside when it started to sprinkle a bit outside. I liked him.''Apfelschorle! Pronounced like “app-fell-shore-leh”''The hike involves a lot of ups and downs from there, and, it depends on which way you go whether you take the gondola back down to Zermatt, or in our case stay higher up since we were staying just next to the gondola. Mom was a bit winded from the hike and I have to admit it was a long and somewhat challenging, but beautiful and rewarding, one. In total we hiked about 12 miles (19.3 km), in the summer heat.''A little waterfall for good measure''Stellisee''Our final stop of Switzerland and therefore our trip was the Stellisee, a lake that, when completely flat and on a clear day, mirrors the Matterhorn.''This famous lake is a photographer’s dream when the conditions are right, and especially at sunrise as it creates a mirror for the Matterhorn. If you want to catch that, stay at the top at Fluhalp or look into camping.''Ooooh she pertty''We, however, made a day trip out of it. Unless you want to take several hours to do the very\xa0the steep climb, take the funicular Zermatt near the train station to Sunnegga, then the gondola to Blauherd.''From there you can either take a higher, more challenging hike to Stellisee or the flatter, short one. We accidentally aimed higher and it was steep but\xa0rewarding just the same.''A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Jul 7, 2015 at 1:13pm PDT''The lake wasn’t flat that day, but I still thought it was quite beautiful, if not a bit over-popular for me.''Chillin with the Matterhorn''Stay and Eat''We stayed at the''Hotel Silvana'', which is a family-run joint (seriously the son is a carbon copy of the dad) owned by the brother of the guy who owns Hotel du Trift.''Mom picked this hotel since she had stayed a few times before (she is a Zermatt enthusiast) and she picked well. I liked this place because it was cute and peaceful, had a nice breakfast spread, and the dinner each night consisted of four delicious, meaty courses and cost about $45 per person, and a beer was around $8.''That would be expensive for anywhere other than Switzerland, where a burger at a restaurant back down on the main drag was $20. Seriously.''It turned out to be a much better value, plus way more peaceful, eating at the Hotel Silvana than it was down below in Zermatt, especially given the increased activity since it was just a week prior to the 150th anniversary of the first ascent of the Matterhorn at the time.''Overall, I was truly impressed by Switzerland and if it didn’t cost an arm and a leg to travel there, would probably spend a lot longer exploring and trekking through the Alps. One day, when money is no object, I’m sure I will do just that.''Pin me!''Thanks Granny, for taking us around the Alps with you.

Welcome to Ahrntal, Italy.''When mother and I continued our journey''following Granny’s footsteps''around Europe, it took us to a place\xa0I hadn’t heard much about before. We had some leeway since it wasn’t super specific, but settled on a valley called Ahrntal since I had already been to other parts of South Tyrol and had''fallen in love with the food''and discovered''I like rock climbing in the Dolomites''(famous local mountains and a UNESCO World Heritage Site).''When we initially looked at the spot on a map again en route on''Eurail'',\xa0Mom pointed out that it was pretty far from the famous Dolomites. It was all that she knew of the region, and it was all I knew as well. I was a little nervous but optimistic.''Then, we arrived and discovered a quaint and far less touristy little valley that was full of greenery and little mountain chalets.\xa0Even better, there were so many hiking trails all over the place that there was no chance of boredom, with or without the Dolomites next door.''Unexpected Bliss''A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Jul 8, 2015 at 3:06am PDT''What I loved about Ahrntal is how undiscovered it still is.

I guess that’s why I dig\xa0it so much – it’s unexpected.''I like this region of Italy for just about every kind of holiday – family, solo (I loved the interactions I had with locals there), and I can imagine it being perfect for romantic holidays, too.''I was also happy to come back and see it in a different season since it was full of fall foliage the last time I was there.

Then we rounded a corner, and, both in awe, my mother said, “this is every other mountain view\xa0on steroids” and I agreed.''Mom taking in the view''It was easy to see why those who live among these mountains erect crosses every so often along the trails and at the top of various peaks.''When you’re surrounded by such profoundly beautiful nature, it becomes that much easier to believe in a higher power – a divine hand that could have created something otherwise beyond imagination.''A common sight along the hiking trails in Italy''To get to the top where the hiking is the best, I suggest taking the round-trip cable car + chairlift combo ticket for €17.''You still get plenty of steep hiking in if you take the route we did, which was the panorama trail plus the trail to the giant cross from the start of the cable car to the chairlift.

With the home side playing at the famous Twickenham stadium and other games taking place in and around London, plenty of visitors are looking for the best areas to stay within easy distance of the home of rugby. While there’s no shortage of''guides on where to eat and drink near the stadiums at this year’s Rugby World Cup'', deciding on which areas to look for accommodation in can be a little more difficult. Twickenham itself may well be a little too congested for most people’s tastes when choosing a place to stay during the tournament, so here’s a rundown of a few nearby locations you might not have considered.''Richmond''Leafy Richmond is a charming royal borough of historical significance. The area is home to London’s largest park, Richmond Park, where wild deer roam, adding a touch of old England to many tourist’s visits. Aside from enjoying the rugby in nearby Twickenham, there are plenty of other things to do during your stay. The famous palace at''Hampton Court''is just down the road, where you can gaze in awe at one of the Queen’s royal residences and have a wander through stunning gardens, visit the annual flower show, or stumble through the dizzying maze. Nearby''Kew Gardens''offer another must see for horticultural enthusiasts, with plenty of exotic plants and greenhouses guaranteed to whisk you away from the English weather for an afternoon. Richmond has plenty of B&Bs, hotels and rentable rooms, making it a perfect place to stay for those wishing to visit the south east for the rugby, without having it right on your doorstep.''Kingston Upon Thames''The Royal Borough of Kingston neighbours Richmond and is also within easy reach of the UK rugby capital. Kingston is a little busier than neighbouring towns, and is in fact something of a shopping and entertainment hub for the area. Having said this, there’s still plenty of historical significance around, including an ancient coronation stone, where several Saxons kings were crowned. Along with wonderful riverside dining, more shops than you can count and great transport links into central London, there are plenty of places to stay during the Rugby World Cup.''Fulham & Putney''The slightly more central options of Fulham and Putney are near enough to central London for convenient trips into the capital, whilst still being far enough out for a sense of suburban serenity. Putney in particular is a great place to visit a number of traditional English pubs, while nearby Fulham is perfect for a weekend day out if you want to watch a game of football at''Craven Cottage'', renowned for its welcoming and family atmosphere. This part of south west London is full of parks and green spaces; perfect for getting out and having a game after being inspired by this year’s world cup. And with plenty of affordable options for short-stay visitors, both Fulham and Putney are perfect destinations for a Rugby World Cup stay.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''No related posts.''Heidelberg for me was a mystery\xa0until I arrived. I had heard good things from a friend who studied abroad there during college,\xa0but otherwise really didn’t have any clue what people do there for fun.''Since my mother and I were letting my''grandmother’s old journal''from her trip there 30 years prior be our guide, it was our\xa0first stop from my home base in Berlin.''Immediately upon arrival we headed to the tourism center outside of the train station and I have mixed feelings as to how helpful it really was, but at least we got a free map. Thanks to a mixture of suggestions from them, what I found online, and granny’s journal entries (which mainly talked about the food. She was as obsessed as I am, it seems), our two days there ended up being unexpectedly delightful. Here’s exactly what we did (and what you can do, too):''Philosopher’s Way''Seems like we could be in a remote forest far, far away''Mom and I are into active vacations. Growing up, many of our travels revolved around hiking and on long weekends, we often popped up to the mountains near home or walked the local trails. Naturally, the first thing that caught our eye while researching was the Philosopher’s way – a trail that runs through the forest on the other side of the Neckar river from Altstadt (old town).''Heidelberg isn’t a particularly large, or small, town with a population of just under 150,000. It reminded me in some ways of my university town (Santa Barbara) with a similar-sized population and beautiful nature so close\xa0by. One could easily forget once ensconced in the forest that any kind of civilization exists nearby.''The trail is so-named after the great minds from the nearby university who would walk these trails to discuss theories and belief systems over the years.\xa0Though Heidelberg is far from the size of a big and bustling city, I can still appreciate how important this forest was and still is to the intellectuals who have roamed through it, seeking clarity.''One of the commenters on my''instagram photo of the walk''said it best when he observed, “it’s another example of the relationship between great minds and monumental trees.”''Humbling''It’s true, going into the peace and quiet of nature has always given me more space for creativity and reflection than the hustle and bustle of a city.''It was inspiring to think that we were walking amongst the same trees the philosophers and maybe even Granny, did, so many years ago.''The philosopher’s way runs for about 8 kilometers and is only one of what appeared to be hundreds of trails available through the forest. It’s easy to access and not too steep.\xa0One could just walk along it for a half hour and see the most popular stretch, though Mother and I chose to take it all the way to the Skift monastery.''Though the monastery wasn’t particularly exciting, the walk was worth it, offering different path options back to the city as well as\xa0the castle, which is another must-see. Unfortunately the gentleman at the tourism office didn’t realize I meant that we wanted to see''this monastery''(duh) and not the Skift – also accessible from the forest path. So, if you find yourself there, let me know if I should return one day and check out that monastery, would you?''The Schloss''The view of the castle from the Philosopher’s Way''Perhaps the most recognizable aspect of Heidelberg is the castle, or Schloss. Dominating the panorama of the city since the 1200s, has been home to many kings and played host to many wars. Evident from the rubble and ruins around today, this fortress had to withstand quite a few attacks.''The width of the walls blew me away. I know these castle things were meant to be fortresses so this makes sense, but I hadn’t known the walls would be a''full meter''thick. I haven’t seen a castle broken in two previously, which to me, made it more interesting. The vines growing all over the exposed bricks only added to its intrigue and place in the history of Heidelberg – not just a bastion of the town, but a growing part of it.''As Mark Twain said of the Schloss, “Misfortune has done for this old tower what it has done for the human character sometimes – improved it.”''The awesome view''While the Schloss itself is impressive, I mainly liked it because of the panoramic views of the city it offers. These are free, while the €6 entrance fee permits entry to the inner rooms. I’m not that much of a castle person, preferring the outdoors, and was therefore more than content to explore just the exterior.''Amazing food''Granny talked a lot about food in her journal, which makes me laugh because most of my conversations with people, when discussing places they’ve been, eventually get to food if they don’t begin there already. I never cared much for the importance of food prior to traveling – you gotta eat to live, right? – but have come to find it''defines many of my experiences abroad''thanks to the connection between food and culture.''Though it’s easy to fall into tourist traps in the old town (which, with its Desigual and Starbucks-type establishments makes it lose its charm and appear just as any other place in the world would), wander off of the main street and you can still find traditional, delicious food.''Schnitzelbank is a tiny, unassuming restaurant with only 8 tables and two waiters. At first glance it’s small and dark like a tavern, and doesn’t seem like it would be delicious, but as my travels have taught me, it’s precisely this kind of place that tends to have the best food. Beyond that, the waiters are friendly and full of energy and the place definitely has its own unique character – not kitschy, but an old historic feel and a dark beer hall type of atmosphere.''Serving up hearty portions of meats with Swabian specialties like''Spätzle''(a local pasta dish with a creamy gravy sauce), mom and I ordered meat dishes that matched the description of what Granny ate in her diary, washed down with local wines. I didn’t take a photo because I’m habitually forgetful of such things when my food arrives, plus I’m not great at food photography. Ergo, you’ll just have to trust me (or check out the''TripAdvisor photos'') that it was delicious – and go try it yourself!''The next morning when it came time to leave, a particularly friendly woman saw us looking at the bus schedule and offered to help us out. She had a family bus pass and invited her on with her, pointing out exactly where we needed to alight for the train station.''Though random acts of kindness tend to follow me wherever I go, I couldn’t help but feel a little bit like it was thanks to our quest to follow Granny’s footsteps that she helped us out – and subsequently make our train that we might have otherwise missed.''Do it yourself:''Take the train to Heidelberg’s main station. We took Eurail’s first class cabin, which, on\xa0Deutsche Bahn, is pretty nice and worth the extra expense since you can get a private cabin if it’s not too busy. If you do take the trains in Europe,''don’t forget''to write in the dates and get it validated before your first trip or you could be fined.''AirBnB''(this link will give you a discount off your booking) is a great option for your stay, and what we decided to use while there''Ask at the tourist information office just outside of the main station for a map of the town''Be sure to have some apfelkuchen (apple cake) and any and every cafe you pass by that offers it. It’s delicious and nobody does cakes better than the Germans do!''*Eurail was kind enough to provide us with train passes. Everything else, we paid for ourselves. I dig Eurail, though. It’s a\xa0convenient way to get around and I’d recommend it either way.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Why I moved to Berlin (and Why I Haven’t Mentioned it Until Now)''Underground Berlin: The Fringes of Society''Which Berlin Neighborhood Should You Stay in?''“She was free in her wildness.

When I went through my spiritual revolution as a child, asking her to bring me to church with her, we started spending our weekends together, too. She was a daily fixture throughout most of my development as a young woman, and her strong, independent spirit made quite an impact. As I moved into adulthood, I sought her counsel often.''Granny when she was my age''It was the October before she passed away when we had the last conversation we would ever have. Sitting in the house she had lived in since I was a child, we spent the last few hours together that we would ever spend one-on-one. I couldn’t have known then that it would be our last conversation, but I suspect she might have.''I was still unhappily working at my old job and she said to me, “you know, I really think you need to write.”''Roughly one year later, I started writing regularly on this blog (and everyone else’s under the sun who would let me contribute), from guesthouses in\xa0Cambodia, hammocks in Thailand, and busses in Indonesia. I had quit everything to pursue a dream, partially because she had faith in me, and she had a habit of being\xa0right.''When my mother made plans to visit me in Europe this summer, I remembered the photos that Granny had kept, documenting her travels. \xa0I asked my mom if we still had those picture books, and she found me something even better – a journal. It turned out that Granny\xa0was a solo travel blogger before travel blogs even existed.''We laughed as we read her words,\xa0speaking of\xa0all the experiences from what she ate to hilarious anecdotes about the people she encountered. I felt for a moment like I was sitting next to her on the couch in her living room again.''We decided to follow her footsteps around Europe, letting her journal be our guide.''Granny’s journal traveled back to Switzerland, 30 years later''Over the course of two weeks we traveled from Berlin down to Heidelberg, Innsbruck in Austria, through the Alps to South Tyrol in Italy (a favorite of mine as well), and finished in Zermatt, Switzerland.''Though I’m party to random acts of kindness from time to time on my travels, we encountered incredibly helpful people\xa0in just about every place we visited. It was like we had a guardian angel along with us (even though I don’t really believe in that stuff).''Mom and I in front of the Matterhorn''I fully expected to find that tons of things had changed from the time she wrote in her journal, roughly thirty years prior, versus what we would encounter.''The funny thing is, the foods we ate were more or less the same. The Alps have been the Alps for millions of years, and the people who live among them still speak the same language and go about their lives in more or less the same fashion as they did before.

You know,''that festival I don’t write about''.''Each year I’ve come home to confront a pretty profound set of the post-playa blues, which is basically a hard dose of reality after living in a giant playground for a week. Burning Man is, most importantly for me, a week of complete digital detoxing and living in the moment – something I really never do for an entire week straight. I didn’t even manage it when I was''living out of a tent in Eastern Africa''for a month.''This year was different, though. I came back with one feeling and one feeling only: empowerment.''I credit this with one action: I finally decided to listen to my inner child\xa0and it was the best decision I could have made. I made it about magic and dancing\xa0more, followed my own desires more, and wandered off alone way more often, following any whim that struck me.''Photos by''Yvonne''I didn’t get it totally right at first, but as the week progressed it turned more adventurous than intentional, and slowly, without noticing, I turned into a six year old again. Not in a childish way, but rather in embodying my childhood mindset of openness and wonder.''At my favorite daytime dance party – Distrikt (I love how this Tuesday they renamed it Dnutz. Class. Always)''Ever since I found myself suddenly grown, I’ve watched kids with admiration mixed with envy for their carefree ways. They approach things with open wonderment and friendly curiosity. They’re still silly, and haven’t learned to fear peer judgement quite yet. They are openly themselves, and don’t really care what color is''so in right now''or whether or not they look fat in that dress.''Burning man was my avenue to return to that state of mind, and to remind myself of who I really am again.\xa0Six year old Kristin adored unicorns. Dressing up in costumes was her religion. She could easily become absorbed into a world of imagination and fantasy. For once I decided to fully be her again.''Life that week was a playground and I could move from spot to spot with the extreme enthusiasm of a child. My vibe seemed to call to the others who were conducting a similar experiment. Just like it used to be, people would come up and interact like kids again, asking, “what are you doing? What makes you happy? Are those rainbows and unicorns on your pants?! Awesome!”''We just said what we felt at the first compulsion, unafraid of a negative reaction, because we were just talking simply out of love and curiosity.''Photo by Brian Kai''Yet six-year-old Kristin had freedoms she’d never had before.\xa0\xa0I was finally an unattended child in a wonderland, ready to embark on an magical\xa0adventure into another realm through the interstellar forces of pixie dust and imagination. Nobody could kill my joy. As soon as anything stopped being stimulating, I moved on, able to consider my desires only. I didn’t have to worry about losing anyone, competing desires, or sticking around anywhere for a second longer than I wanted to.''Many people came into my story, some for only a moment and others would become repeat encounters. Each time it was like finding a kid I knew on the playground who I could go on an adventure with, and when I was ready to be independent again, I moved on, so\xa0the positivity levels stayed high.''With the lovely''Susi Maier''On Friday night, as I watched the sun set, completely alone as the sky went from pink to purple then blue, an Astronaut biked up. He didn’t speak – only made beeping noises – as he pointed to the pack on the back of his bike that read, ‘space ice cream.’ He took out a nugget of the creamy chocolate (which was much like the consistency of the marshmallows in Lucky Charms cereal), handed it over, then biked away without a word. I smiled broadly as the sun dipped below the mountains and I savored the treat. Mine to experience and remember. Mine only.''Thank you''Julian Walter''(Check his gallery out!)''Just the night before, as I paused on my bike to plug in my light-up wolf hood, someone noticed me and came over to shine a light so that I could see better. After five minutes of chatting he told me he brought his cello with him.''The cello happens to be my all-time favorite instrument. Ask anyone who knows me. It makes me get a lump in my throat. It makes me kind of want to cry out of some kind of joyous pain left by another soul in a lifetime past. That’s the only way I can explain it.''A few days later he found me again, took me to a giant white balloon that had inflated just one block over and happened to be acoustically perfect, and played two beautiful songs.''Serendipity gifted me this?! (photo cred:''Susi'')''I could go on all day with stories like this of the serendipity, but you’re probably running out of time and\xa0my heart couldn’t be pounding any harder as it is, overflowing with beautiful memories. It just might break my chest.''On the final night — the night the man burned — I took it full throttle and dressed myself exactly the way six year old Kristin would have, with rainbow-unicorn-robot battle pants, a furry pink jacket, star face paint and rhinestones around my eyes.''Not the greatest photo, but for once, I didn’t make photography a priority''Letting go and simultaneously pulling in this new-yet-old me led me to a mental breakthrough. Even though I’ve traveled alone for three years, I’ve always made it a point to meet as many others as possible. I would become depressed without fellow human interaction, which I knew was born of a need for external validation. This time, the critical voice in my head began to fade, I stopped talking harshly to myself, but rather softly and forgivingly. I started to like and understand this person inside me who I’d previously sometimes been at odds with.''Could we reach a mutual understanding? What if i approached life with the zest of six-year-old rainbow unicorn Kristin – Creatively, openly, and inwardly inquisitively? What if I never reserved a compliment and remained open and hungry for adventure? With an unstifled and optimistic view of life, unencumbered by old scars, could anything be possible?''While I can’t say this eureka moment is due entirely to one week at Burning Man, as I’ve explored happiness, Buddhism, and the benefits of a healthy mental state ever since I started traveling solo three years ago, I can say that it was the final cherry on top I needed, simply because it gave me space to think and to be''me''again.''And you know what? I can finally say, without that little pit in my stomach that says, “you’re lying,” or “you’re being narcissistic” that I really like me.''I am finally enough.''I just hope I can hold onto this feeling.''—''Thanks for reading to the end. I have an announcement for you!''There’s a project I’ve been working on all summer long'', and it’s partially responsible for the lack of writing you’ve seen on this blog lately.''Many of you, in one form or another, have sent me messages over the years that say similar things: you want to travel the world but you’re scared.

I\xa0pictured walking up to every street vendor, kiosk, and taxi driver with no ability to communicate. My travels could wind up in a storm of confusion and I’d be left feeling frustrated and lost. While that did happen from time to time, it was rare, and much less stressful\xa0than I initially expected.''If you want to travel independently and don’t know the language in the countries you aim to visit, here are some easy steps to help you through:''English is a Common Second Language''In most places that receive Western tourists, someone is around who can speak English. Even in the''Tibetan Autonomous Region''of China — an area that is so far off the tourist trail that most tourists never end up there — I found a guesthouse that was owned by a couple of Californians!''English is the language\xa0of tourism. Given you’re reading this right now you probably speak enough English to get by in your travels. Most people who work in tourism know at least a little bit and use it to communicate with guests from every nationality.''Of course, the more off the path you head the less likely it is to find English speakers, so keep the following communcation methods in mind:''There’s a lot in Context''Making Friends with Locals in Borneo''When I walked up to the bus depot in Bondowoso on the island of Java, Indonesia, the locals hanging out there immediately asked me, “''Ijen''?”, then pointed me directly to the bus I needed. I didn’t have to explain to anyone that I needed a bus because I was in the bus depot, that much was obvious. I didn’t need to explain that I wanted to go to Ijen because that’s one of very few places tourists in the area want to go, and I was clearly a tourist. This wasn’t a one-off situation, either. It happens nearly everywhere I go.''So much is evident through\xa0context. If I walk up to a food stand or sit in a restaurant, it’s clear I want to eat. If I walk into a hostel, it’s clear I’d like a place to sleep, and if I walk into a bus station, I probably want to go somewhere. Next all I have to do is say what I want to eat or where I’d like to go — one word, maybe two — and we’ve said all that we need to say to get me fed or en route to the next place.''When in doubt, use the ‘point and shrug’ method''Hitchhiking in Java with the 13 or so words I knew''When I first moved to Taiwan I had to open a bank account on my own. I was a Mandarin\xa0beginner back then and couldn’t read the paperwork so I shrugged and handed it to the lady at the desk with a meek,''I’m sorry I don’t get it can you help me?'', smile. She was understanding and took a pen and filled in the forms for me.''When I needed some help fixing my bicycle in rural Cambodia, I rode up to a house that had a workshop, pointed to the bike seat, and did the same shrug and smile. The man cheerfully fixed it for me (no charge) as an''adorable group of kids ran over to say hello''– the only English word they knew. I rode away with a functioning\xa0bike seat, no words needed.''With a few exceptions, locals are typically pretty understanding that I don’t know how to speak Khmer, Thai, or the language of whatever place Im in. It’s easy enough to communicate using hand gestures and facial expressions if that’s all you’ve got. That said…''Simple pleasantries can go a long way''Attending an engagement ceremony in Kuala Lumpur''Learning how to say at least ‘hello’ and ‘thank you’ makes you more likable as a foreigner. When I need something, instead of barging into a place and spouting off my needs and desires in English, I open with a greeting in the local language. It’s polite, it shows I’m trying, and it indicates respect.''I usually learn this by asking the first local I interact with. Maybe it’s a person at the guesthouse, someone selling me a''SIM card'', or the taxi driver from the airport. Generally they’re delighted that I asked and I want to know, sharing the information happily.''Learn the hand gestures''A friendly local in Thailand''In Vietnam a local man waved me over by outstretching his arm, facing his palm down, and waving the back of his hand it in my direction. He was enticing\xa0me to look at the bun cha (addictive rice noodles with tangy fish sauce, crunchy greens and pork patties) he was making. I knew that he meant, “come here,” because I’d done some research on hand gestures prior to arriving.''In the Maldives, when we ate our food we did so with our hands. I used my right while my travel buddy, a natural lefty, accidentally went in with his left. When I whispered to him to switch, he felt a bit embarrassed that he hadn’t realized it’s rude to use your left hand for eating and hand gestures there.''Locals are usually understanding that if you’re not from a place, you might not realize which hand gestures mean what, but at the risk of offending someone, it’s good to know beforehand what means what in the country you’ll be visiting. It also goes to show how much effort you’ve put into respecting the local customs\xa0and people tend to feel more helpful when they feel respected.''Help will generally find you''I know this sounds very damsel-in-distress.

When I turned around and said, “can anyone bilingual help me out here?” someone immediately stepped out of line and translated.''This happens all the time, whether in Asia or Europe.

It didn’t matter that I was in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, full of young and social people. I could have been anywhere at all and it would have felt lonely.''This is why traveler’s lows are so low.

Inevitably, something will\xa0not go as it appeared in your mind when you planned it.''Where traveling is concerned we expect it will be\xa0nothing short of amazing\xa0or we would not make so many monetary and time sacrifices in order to experience it.\xa0This is why when a vacation hits low points, it’s so much more intense.''So how can you\xa0bounce back from the lows? How do you get back into a state of flow? Try the following:''Know that it will happen and you can’t avoid it''As most experienced travelers know and newbies come to find out,\xa0there are many long physically and mentally taxing days, instances\xa0of acute loneliness, and\xa0times\xa0of confusion when traveling. These exist back home, too. They’re just a part of life.''Nothing good lasts forever, and thankfully nothing bad does, either. Preparing for the worst while allowing for the best isn’t necessarily negative. On the contrary, it can be constructive. It doesn’t mean to expect the worst, it just means that knowing bad times will come and go helps for dealing with them better when they do show up.''Stay off of Facebook''Social media is dangerous when traveling. If you’re feeling homesick, it can really exacerbate the problem as friends back home post photos having fun doing the things without you that you used to do together.''Remember that only people’s best moments are shared on Facebook, and that comparison is the thief of joy. Chances are they feel similarly jealous of all of the wonderful things you’re posting, as well. It’s all perception, and Facebook can skew that perception greatly.''Talk to a friend or family member''When I am really feeling down, my friends tend to help me through it, even if they’re far away. We find a time to Skype or have a phone call. It’s important to hear the voice of someone who knows and loves you, rather than just text chatting, so that you can feel that sense of comfort again.''Also remember that they can’t fix your problem for you, just like they couldn’t back when you were at home. Try not to burden them with only negativity, but simply enjoy connecting with someone familiar again.''Use the down time as an opportunity to build problem-solving skills''The whole point of traveling is to experience something that isn’t home, which naturally means it will not be anything you think it could be or are used to. There will be plenty of frustrating and bewildering times that push you to the brink. However these are all opportunities to come out of it stronger and more capable than before. Learning to pull yourself out of down times is a gift, and you have to earn it by experiencing a low now and then.''Don’t drown your sorrows''A bottle of wine or a night out is fun in the moment and can help you forget your problems momentarily, but if it’s a seriously low low, then the next day the anxiety will tend to creep in. Drinking is a band-aid that’ll be ripped off too soon when the hangover comes. Find other ways to make it through tough times.''Do what\xa0makes you happy''If you love being outside, leave the city and go for a hike. If you love swimming, find a beach. If you love food, take a cooking class. Think about what distractions can put you in a state of flow again and seek them out.''Read things that lift your spirits''Reading and soul-searching tend to be really helpful for me when I’m feeling down.''Zen Pencils''is an example that\xa0lifts me back up with inspiring quotes drawn\xa0into comic strips.''Reading about human psychology helps as well, so that I can better understand why my brain is following negative thought patterns. A few books that have given me new perspective are''What Makes You Not a Buddhist'',''The Art of Happiness'', and''Thinking, Fast and Slow''.''In the end, time is your friend. In time everything heals and change is always just around the corner. Try to pull yourself out of the negativity by deciding to be happy rather than sad. It’s amazing how much remembering that you’re captain of the ship can help things to move back into a positive direction.''Remember, you’re not alone in having travel slumps. It truly does happen to everyone, and the good times will come again.''Pin me!''Have you ever had a traveling low?

The struggle was mainly a political one rooted in\xa0religious and ethnic differences between parts of\xa0Northern Ireland’s nationalist community (principally Roman Catholic) and unionist community (principally Protestant).''On paper the disagreements and conflicts stemmed from Northern Ireland’s status as part of the United Kingdom and\xa0anti-Catholic discrimination in housing, employment, policing, and voting.\xa0The fighting resulted in nearly 4,000 casualties, many of which were civilian. the Good Friday peace agreement “ended the violent conflict in Northern Ireland by creating a power-sharing government and serves as a positive example worldwide for handling ethnic conflict” (via''NPR'').''I mention this because for many people, the fear of visiting Northern Ireland remains due to its history but is largely unfounded.

He was, without a doubt, the best guide I’ve ever had. For anything. Ever.''Given he normally drives the cast and crew during filming, he was the perfect person to show us the remaining locations. He’s also just nice to be around, and we spent the whole time joking, poking harmless fun at each other, and enjoying the beauty of the Northern Irish coast.''I don’t often talk up tours, but this one is well worth it, mainly because of Phil and how knowledgable he is about the history of the area and the lore from the show.''Murlough Bay AKA Storm’s End''Standing on Ireland, photographing Scotland (photo cred: Steve)''This was my favorite stop of the second day and maybe of the whole trip.

I worried I wouldn’t meet anyone and that I’d spend a lot of time feeling lonely.''Yet even in the most remote places, I was proven wrong time and time again. When I feared I’d be alone,\xa0fate stepped in I ended up forming the best bonds. Are you thinking of traveling alone but worry you’ll never meet anyone? The following people\xa0will turn your fears into hope:''Yvonne in Thailand''Our matching tattoos''We met on Twitter, rendezvoused in Bangkok, woke up at 5am, and got a''magical monk tattoo''together. It was Yvonne’s fourth (she has her whole back done) but my first, and easily the most spiritual ink either of us has ever had.''Years later we’ve become the best of friends. She even helped me find my new home when I visited her in''Berlin''for the first time, introducing me to one of the world’s most wonderful cities. She came with me to Burning Man, and''I spent Christmas with her family''. We chat nearly daily and I see her weekly when we’re in the same place. It’s a wonderful friendship, and we owe it all to traveling.''The Four in Thailand''The Four in Bangkok''In London over a year later''When I was in''Pai in Northern Thailand'', I became part of the four – one 19-year-old girl from Canada, one 23-year old from England, one 28-year-old from Scotland, and myself, the fourth. I don’t remember who I met first, or how it came to pass that we gelled so well together, but it just happened bonding over Chang beers one night and from then on we were inseparable. Four girls with blue eyes and brown hair, all from different places and of varying ages, but with one thing in common: solo travelers who came together under the pretense of enjoying a year in Southeast Asia.''Everything we did revolved around having fun, but also in supporting each other. It was a cohesive group that still lived on a full year and a half later when I visited them in London. “This is what makes good friends,” Fiona said, “We put in the effort\xa0and that’s testament to why we are still close”.''So much time can pass, but when we get together nothing will have changed. It will be us, and we’ll still be the four.''Ned in Borneo''Standing on top of the world with Ned (and our Singaporean friend from the guesthouse)''We sat across from each other in a dorm\xa0room I’d impulse booked in Malaysian Borneo. I’d toyed with the idea of climbing Kinabalu over the course of two days – the standard method involving an expensive guesthouse stay near the top – but couldn’t shoulder the cost. “I know a way to do it for cheap, but it’s a''one-day hike''this way,” he told me.''I went with him and did the most physically difficult hike of my life, but his positivity carried me the whole way. At one point I said, “Ned, go on without me. If I can’t reach the top I won’t hold you back.” With three minutes to spare, I made it to a smiling Ned at the top, holding out his watch and shouting, “You did it!”''Later we took a''motorbike loop together around Borneo'', crazy and irresponsible as it was. We filled\xa0up soda bottles with gasoline hoping the attendants wouldn’t see and biked through jungles. Ned also told me about trekking in Nepal which motivated me to make the trek a year later.

I didn’t fear seeking out places where''other tourists don’t usually go''because I knew I’d have a friend\xa0along for the ride. Though we were constantly meeting other people, it was really nice to know that for that time in Vietnam, I’d always have at least one partner in crime.''Ya Ting in China''With Ya Ting at our last stop together: Lugu Lake in Sichuan Province''If it weren’t for Ya Ting, being in China could have meant a lot more solo traveling, but like it always does, life worked out. Ya Ting is a dynamic Chinese girl who had quit her job to travel on her own. It’s not as common to do in China, but she was unfazed. I met her in a dorm room in Lijiang where I’d arrived after a long solo bus ride. As I prepared to venture deeper into the Himalayas, I knew things could have become a lot lonelier. Thankfully, Ya Ting changed her plans and came along with me.''We''hitchhiked together'',''trekked for days'', and sought out adventure after adventure. She was the first local I had traveled with long term in any of the countries I’d been to yet and it was such a treat to be brought so closely into a new culture for our 3 weeks together.''Ellen in Nepal''We made it to the top!''If you believe in fate, and I do, then you could say it put Ellen and I together. I was gearing up to trek solo, without a guide nor porter, in Nepal. As I boarded that bus, I still hadn’t found anyone to go with. Seats were supposed to be assigned and I took the last one that day not realizing that they should have been purchased ahead of time. I did my usual, “I don’t know the rules” shrug and the attendant sat her next to me as he moved people around to their assigned seats.''Over the course of the next two hours we bonded like two long-lost friends as she told me about India and I told her about China. She’d solo traveled across India, mainly staying with locals and all I could think to myself was, “this girl is the epitome of badass.”''Over the next two weeks I trailed behind her, always walking\xa0all day from sunup til sundown, all because she was driving me forward. Honestly, Ellen, the reason why we managed to cover the''Annapurna circuit and Base Camp''so quickly was because of you. Thanks for motivating me. Months later, I had an 8-hour layover in Brussels and she didn’t even hesitate to clear her schedule and hang out with me during that time. That’s friendship, and I value it completely.''Callum in South Africa''Callum, and tigers''“I’m glad you’re adventurous too,” Callum said to me as he turned to park in the township in rural South Africa on our way to''hike in the Drakensberg''. There was streetside BBQ sizzling on the sidewalk and we’d seen it in unison and given each other the “Yeah? Let’s eat!” look.''We got out of the car and the obvious confusion on the cook’s face turned to welcoming joy when he heard us say, “so how much for the steak? We’re hungry, man”''His mother came out, bashful at the international guests, making sure that we had everything we could possibly need – beans, pap (maize made into a fluffy side dish), and a spoon. I’m not sure what the spoon was for, because we went in with our hands, local style. She was so pleased that she asked for my email as we promptly ordered two more steaks to take along on our hike. weeks later, she emailed me with an invitation to stay with her next time we passed through town.''Since I can’t drive a stick-shift (Los Angeleno, sorry) Callum drove the whole time during our''two week road trip across South Africa''and never complained.\xa0I was lucky to have found him through asking on Facebook, and it turned out that I couldn’t have asked for a better road trip buddy.''The best gift in life is to find people who inspire you to learn, to try things you’ve never considered before, and to motivate you beyond what you thought you were capable of. So many of the aforementioned have done that for me, and to have had the pleasure of meeting them was a blessing.''The list is practically endless of people who have shown up just when I thought I was going to have a lonely day. Sometimes it was on a bus ride, on a hiking trail, or as simple and easy as meeting in a guesthouse. I thank the universe for letting all of our paths cross, and I know that the future will bring me even more of these experiences as my solo travels continue.''So please don’t fear traveling alone. Even if you’re the shy type, you will meet people. Travelers are friendly, and there are so many of us out there doing this thing solo.

I haven’t been to a hotel before that offered all of that.''Their “staycation” package aimed at locals who want a vacation at home also includes an afternoon cupcake class, the bounty of which we enjoyed tremendously at my reader meetup a couple days later. The location was great, too, located an easy 5-minute walk from the Ion mall. Now normally malls aren’t my thing, but this one has a food stall market in one of the lower levels that serves up all kinds of delicious food, including the famous chicken rice (steamed or roasted chicken served at room temperature, served with rice cooked in\xa0chicken broth, chili paste, and soup).''The light show from the sky walk''Super trees!''Nearby: The Ion mall for foodies and an easily accessible train station for a jaunt over to the Super Tree grove at the Gardens by the Bay, which has hourly light shows starting after sunset.

When my jet lag was so bad that I slept into the afternoon one day, they packed me a sandwich from Basilico, the Italian restaurant, to take out with me when I explored the city that evening just so that I wouldn’t have to waste time on worrying about food. I didn’t have to ask – it was just waiting for me.''When I had to catch a super early flight out the next day, they once again packed me a snack so that I wouldn’t have to go hungry.

Well, that and the bed, of course:''A sweet suite''I also tend to find luxury hotels in Southeast Asia to be a phenomenal value.

My roti and dhal dish kept me happy, plus I never pass up an opportunity to forego cutlery and dig in with a hand (the right one out of politeness, of course).''Remembering the''delicious hot drink from Nepal'', I ordered a chai tea which came in two cups. When I looked at it curiously, the waiter poured the spiced, milky chai between two cups just as I’d seen done in Malaysia when ordering teh tarik. The result was bubbly, sweet goodness which I savored despite the heat of the day. Thanks, Glenn, that was a winner.''Stingray on the water''a great dinner location (Photo cred goes to Kasia)''“Really,''stingray''?” I asked Ken, a fellow American who has been living in Singapore for the past four years.''He was very enthusiastic about the stingray, insisting it was delicious. After my reader meet-up near the Marina Bay a few of us decided to jump into a taxi for some good ol’ night market-style hawker food, and he insisted this was some of the best. Located on the water and a bit outside of what would be considered downtown, I have to agree, it’s great for seafood.''Another reader from the meet up, Kasia, and I apprehensively tried the stingray with spicy green onion sauce and rice and you know what? It was phenomenal. The steak-like texture of the flaky white meat and the complete lack of fishiness plus the spicy sauce and a beer to wash it all down was perfection.''Sitting on the rock jetty afterwards with a couple of beers while watching the city from a distance and enjoying the finally-bearable temperature (Singapore sits on the equator and is always pretty hot and humid) of the calm night was a great way to finish off the meal.''Laksa – coconut noodles I wanted to love''I just can’t love you the way I want to''Most Singaporeans will agree that while there isn’t a specific Singaporean cuisine, two dishes stand out as unique to the city-island: carrot cake and laksa.''Singaporean laksa is made with rice noodles, spicy coconut broth, and prawns which impart a good deal of prawn flavor into the soup. It’s a soup of the Peranakan cuisine which is a mixture of Chinese and Malay ethnicities, present in Panang and Melaka in Malaysia and in Singapore, as well as a few areas in Indonesia.''Most locals also agree that the best place to get it is in Katong, a neighborhood of Singapore. I rode for 30 minutes on the bus to try this soup, apprehensive because I know that I’m not a seafood fan, but, as in the case with the stingray, am always willing to try.''The best way to describe my feelings towards laksa is to quote my vegetarian sister, who will often say, “that looks good for people who like that kind of thing,” when a meat dish arrives at the table, appreciating that it must taste good, but not to her palette. \xa0That’s how I feel towards laksa. I can tell from the creaminess that it is hearty and tastes great, but the fishiness is just too overpowering for me. But don’t let me sway you if you’re a seafood lover, because everyone else who has tried it thinks I’m crazy.''These are a few of the foods that stood out\xa0during my 6-day search for the best hawker food in Singapore. My goal was to find the authentic and the off the beaten path eats that wouldn’t be full of tourists. Considering I didn’t see any others at the places I ate, I felt victorious in my quest, though in a city with as many food adventures as Singapore has, it can be never-ending.''I was told by many people that Singapore only needs 3 days, maximum, to be explored. I couldn’t disagree more. There’s more than just great food here, and even after an additional week, there’d be much more to see. It’s not as cheap as the rest of Southeast Asia, but fairly on par with the major Western cities of the world. Don’t write it off because it’s not cheap – it’s worth a long visit, and if eating the local, traditional food, doesn’t have to be all that expensive.''Do you love eating in Singapore?

One of the more recent cards of theirs that I’m taking a look at is the''Marriott Rewards Credit Card''as I stay in hostels less and less and hotels more and more. \xa0They recently asked me to think about what it is that motivates the travel decisions of myself and other millennials based on a survey they conducted on travel preferences among consumers 18-67 years of age who stay in a hotel at least five nights per year for business, pleasure or both. “Millennials,” by the way, are those who are aged 18-34 (phew! I edged in there by 5 years). \xa0They found that those in our age group are more likely to travel with a purpose to participate in volunteer activities or taking a charitable trip.

Traveling to Volunteer''At elephant nature park''I recall sitting in a restaurant in''Namibia''with a fellow American girl when a local guy asked us what we were “there to save.” We looked at him, puzzled, and said we were doing no saving, but rather just there to have a good time and enjoy the great outdoors (point #2!).

We travel to hike, sleep in tents,''jump off of bridges'', climb things, and SCUBA dive. Even back when I was only able to travel for one week per year, I spent that week doing active things in beautiful places. According to Marriott Rewards Credit Card’s survey'', that’s pretty typical of millennials, as 78% agreed they are more interested in thrilling vacations than lazy trips.''3. Traveling for nightlife''At Marquee in Las Vegas''Vegas'', Ibiza, or Koh Phangan, anybody? I’ve visited all three with the express purpose of seeking fun nightlife and still do frequent Las Vegas trips with my friends every summer when I return home. It’s the perfect vacation for us because we already know we’re going to have a built-in good time in a place we’re familiar with and understand well. We have a system, we know the drill, and it’s an easy meeting point for all of us coming from different parts of California. It was interesting for me to see that most others in my age group travel for the same reasons, though not entirely surprising since most people I meet on my travels are closer to my age range, and tend to like the same things that I do.

My life overflows with these little bits of perfection, given to me by the grace and kindness of others because they want to be a good host, don’t understand why a girl is wandering by herself and feel she needs to be taken care of, or they have genuinely never met an American girl before and are curious.''Before the time of photography, it used to be that the highest esteemed painters were the ones who did portraiture and historical paintings. In the hierarchy of genres, landscape painting was near the bottom. Today I feel the same is true – photographing people is difficult business. First you have to ask and be prepared for a, “no,” then you have to somehow capture their essence in a single frame.''In the rare moments that I did have the courage, the result was beautiful:''Thailand''Taking a picture of you, taking a picture of me''While exploring the ancient capital of''Suhkothai, Thailand,''I saw this monk taking a photo of me and quickly snapped a photo right back of him. I was so surprised he actually wanted to get a picture of me when I was so sure that he was the most interesting one between the two of us, but I guess\xa0that sort of thing is in the eye of the beholder.''Just afterwards we took a photo together, smiling at the camera. This was the first portrait I took during my travels that began almost three years ago, and it came about in the most curious of ways.''Borneo''Photo Cred: Kirsty Holcamp (thank you for sharing your photos of our trip with me!)''These kids belong to the Bajau tribe, also known as sea gypsies, who live their lives on the water just off of the island of Mabul in Malaysian Borneo. I had the pleasure of seeing them when I''SCUBA dived in Sipadan'', sleeping, cooking, and living almost entirely on boats.''Some of these guys can free dive 20 meters down to go fishing, and their underwater eyesight is thought to be better than your typical human. Their profound connection to the ocean is something I can really respect, given how much I love to spend my time in and near it as well.''Maldives''Another side of the Maldives''One of the most interesting places I visited during my 2013 travels was the Maldives, not because it’s a beautiful island nation that’s famous for its resorts and white sand beaches, but because I went off the typical tourist trail and''stayed with a family there''.''This photo perfectly depicts what the experience was like – spear fishing and then BBQing with the family right on the beach. Pictured here is one of the brothers with a sweet lips fish.''Sri Lanka''Hello!''The train in Sri Lanka was one of the most beautiful and rich with cultural interaction of all of my experiences in the country. The''people on the train''were incredibly friendly and curious about the foreign girl in second class, with them.''I loved this family in particular who smiled and waved every time the train turned, allowing them to face me as I stood in the door frame, hanging out over the rice paddies and tea plantations.''Philippines''Gorgeous kids, gorgeous island''It had been a lonely Christmas Eve in''Camiguin, Mindanao'', mainly for two reasons: tourists are told to stay away from Mindanao due to terrorist activity in the west, and because the Philippines had recently been hit by a hurricane. I saw no reason why either one should stop me from visiting Camiguin, unaffected by both situations.''When Christmas day rolled around, the bungalow I stayed at was suddenly open with life, including a gang of incredibly friendly and adorable kids who asked if they could hang out with me. They asked me questions all about my family and what it’s like where I’m from, posed for pictures, played with my camera and took some great ones themselves, and made me feel incredibly at home. Thanks so much guys, you’re beautiful.''Vietnam''She was awesome''My last night in Vietnam was spent in the home of this Hmong woman in''Sapa\xa0on Valentine’s Day''. Cuddled up with 15 new friends I’d made in the days prior, sleeping like sardines in the loft of the drafty house, it was the closest I’ve come to living, just for a day,\xa0how most of the world lives.''There were no floors, no heaters, and some homes didn’t even have doors. What they do have is amazing beauty – both the people and the landscape.''China''This cowboy''Straddling the border of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in China is''Lugu Lake'', a place generally populated by minority tribes from Tibet. When this man saw me stopping on my bicycle to take photos, he came over to say hello. I have since forgotten what we discussed, but remember his surprise and delight when I wanted to take a photo of him.''China is confusing and frustrating for a lot of tourists due to the language barrier and''extremely different culture''to what most of us are used to. However, my time there, spent mostly amongst locals and''hitchhiking solo through the country''is one of the most rewarding and daring adventures I’ve had yet. The incredible hospitality will came back to my mind every\xa0time I think of China.''Love their outfits!''Just north of the border with Vietnam sits Xin Jia Jie, land of the\xa0Hmong tribe who have built those''famous endless rice terraces''by hand and water buffalo over thousands of years. As I was photographing a particularly stunning sunset these kids ran by in their everyday attire – truly, this is not special occasion clothing – and agreed when I asked if I could take a photo of them.''I love the style of the women here – always decked out in bright colors and patterns. Hmong women have some seriously wicked style!''Nepal''Himalayan beauty''The first stop on my trek on the''Annapurna Circuit in Nepal''was decided when, upon entering the tiny mountainside town of Ghermu, a little girl held out her hand to offer the two I was walking with and me some sea buckthorn berries as we passed by.''Next a goat came by and bowed its head for petting, and a farmer smiled and waved. It was so friendly and felt so welcoming that it’s still fresh in my mind as a highlight of Nepal – a country full of beautiful, kind, and resilient people.''South Africa''Those eyes''While in Cintsa, South Africa on the Wild Coast, I visited the smallest township in South Africa. During apartheid, townships were forced settlements for black and colored (a non derogatory term for people of mixed race) citizens. These days, many people still live in townships without running water or electricity.''The''backpackers''I visited in Cintsa has brought solar-powered mobile computer unit to the local school there, and while I checked it out, a few local kids came over to play. I handed my camera to one and this is my favorite photo she took – this little boy kept grabbing at the lens, either wanting a turn or unsure of how the camera worked. His perplexed expression only half makes this picture. It’s those deep eyes I can’t get enough of.''Malawi''Super model poses''The friendliness of Malawians is legendary. During my stay on the giant Lake Malawi, I experienced this first-hand when local people would walk along the beach with me, or enthusiastically ask me to take their photo.''They ask because they have no access to cameras or photo printers themselves. For them, their chance of having a photo to remember their younger selves by hinges on\xa0asking tourists who might take a photo and mail a print of it back. It was heartbreakingly beautiful.''Over the past three years I’ve learned that the world is fundamentally full of kind souls, and I’ll never let negative news article tell me any differently. People in far-off places will be endeared to me, they will not seem strange or different. Though there is undeniably evil in the world, I’ll remember that the vast majority of people are good, kind, and giving.''When I pause and appreciate these memories, I stop feeling like''anything is missing or in some way not whole''. This is because of them. They all gave a part of themselves to me to take on the journey and by lamenting this lifestyle I indirectly undervalue them. I pledge not to do that anymore.''Thank you to the people who I will probably never see again, who took it upon themselves to make me smile, to show me the way when I was lost, to pick me up when I was down, and to fill me up when I was empty.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Reflections on Nearly Two Years of Solo Travel''10 Questions from 2 Years of Traveling the World''30 Amazing Photos from Two Years of Traveling the World''This post was brought you by Alana Morgan, a Chiang-Mai based Seattle native who loves off the beaten path gems as much as we all do! As part of an effort to\xa0make BMTM an even better Southeast Asia resource, Alana is here to share her expert knowledge of this fabulous city in the north of Thailand.''Chiang Mai has a lot of temples. Hundreds in fact.''I can understand why travelers visiting Thailand could get templed out. It’s similar to visiting cathedrals in Italy – they’re impressive, beautiful and, well, all start to look the same after a while. But while the Buddhist temples naturally have their similarities, they can also be\xa0unique, especially in the northern Thai town of Chiang Mai.''In Thailand, you can tell if an area is important – and has a lot of money – by the number of temples you see. Since the temples are built purely from donations, it’s a good way to measure the pockets of the locals.\xa0As the capital of the north for more than 700 years, Chiang Mai has a long history at the top and the temples to prove it.''Wat Doi Kham''While numbers vary depending on what source you look at, there are more than 200 temples in the province and around 80 within the city limits. Yet\xa0many tourists tend to just visit the same small collection of locations found in their guidebooks.''While temples like Wat Phra Thai Doi Suthep with the golden''chedi''(stupa) atop the mountain on the east side of town, or''Wat Chedi Luang''situated in the very center of the old city, are certainly impressive and worth a look there are so many more to discover . Here are the top temples in Chiang Mai for those who like to head off the beaten path:''Wat Palat''Wat Palat''When most visitors go to Doi Suthep to visit Wat Phra That Doi Suthep, they miss another unique temple that can be found part way up the mountain.''Wat Palat, also sometimes spelled “Wat Palad”, “Wat Pha Lat”, or Wat Palaad”, is unlike any other temple you’ll see in Chiang Mai. While most temples feature an ornate main temple hall, known as a “viharn”, Wat Palat isn’t centered around one grand building. The grounds, not the temple buildings, are what will stick in your memory with meandering forest paths, various shrines and statues everywhere you look, and the fact that the complex is set right at the top of a waterfall spilling toward the city below.''How to get there'': When driving up Doi Suthep looking for the large shrine on your left with a giant white Buddha statue, then head down the driveway to the left of the shrine. (It’s nicest to get your own set of wheels when visiting Doi Suthep, but you can also hire a taxi or songthaew (red truck). You can also access the temple by a jungle path starting at the end of Suthep Road at the base of the mountain.'')''Wat Srisuphan''Wat Sri Suphan''Off of Wualai Road (the Saturday Walking Street) just outside the old walls on the south side of town, Wat Sri Suphan is home to a special''ubosot''(shrine) that’s covered by hammered silver designs made by local artisans. The neighborhood was traditionally a silver worker’s district and you can see the craftsmen still at work in the onsite studio (the shrine is still in progress).''How to get there'': From the Old City, go to Chiang Mai Gat and cross over heading southeast on Wualai Road. Keep a look out on your right-hand side for temple signs as it’s on a little side street. 100 Wualai Road''Wat Lok Molee''Wat Lok Molee''Wat Lok Molee is one of the last wooden temples in town and has a large brick''chedi''to boot. There’s a lot to look at here – while the inside of the main temple building is refreshingly uncluttered, the grounds are filled with a wide array of religious and secular statues, shrines and artwork. You can also indulge in a coffee or even a massage and, while not far from the main tourist hub, you won’t see many other foreign travelers.''How to get there'': Wat Lok Molee is about 400 meters east from Chang Phuak Gate on Manee Nopparat Road. You can walk there easily from the Old City.''Wat Umong''Wat Umong''Originally, Wat Umong was built as a forest monastery in the 14th century however, as the city grew\xa0what used to be a remote sanctuary is now incredibly close to Chiang Mai University and clusters of apartments popular with the students. It still retains its forest feel, though, and is home to a series of tunnels found under the main''chedi''. There is also a meditation center on site open to foreigners and Thais interested in learning more about Vipassana meditation.''How to get there:''Located near the foot of Doi Suthep and south of Chiang Mai University on Cherng Doi Road, go on your own wheels or with a tuk tuk.''Wat Jed Yod''Wat Jed Yod''Just minutes away from the popular Nimmanhaemin neighborhood, Wat Jed Yod is modeled after the Maha Bodhi Temple, the temple in Bodhgaya, India where the Buddha is thought to have gained enlightenment. \xa0It’s another great example of a Thai Buddhist temple that doesn’t look like all the others and doesn’t see many foreign tourists.''How to get there'': The temple is just off the Superhighway, north of the Nimmanhaemin-Huay Kaew intersection and within walking distance from Nimmanhaemin Road and Maya''About the Author:''Alana Morgan is a twenty-something traveler trying to figure out life one place at a time,\xa0and blogging about it at''Paper Planes''.\xa0Originally from Seattle, she’s been living, working, and traveling in Thailand and Southeast Asia for the past three years with no plans to ‘settle down’ anytime soon.

It has been years, but it still sticks in my mind when I’m looking at the edge of something I’m about to slide down or jump off of at top speed.''“I’m not going to believe that coming from someone who’s wearing a skydiving shirt,” joked Chris, the instructor, when I said I was a bit nervous to stand up-board down the dune face.''The sand wasn’t like the icy snow''in the mountains near home''in California, though. It’s a fine, soft landing and though steep, not too difficult\xa0to learn on.''Easily alternating between fast and slow with a heel and toe motion, the end of the run came quickly and left me wanting more.''Hoisting the board back up, I eyed the dune once again. Another steep climb.

Markets with tribal wares sit alongside German-style cafes serving up sausages.''It offers the small town charms of dive bars, Sunday farmer’s markets, people who recognize you after a day or two, and of course, a wide array of adventure activities.''With so many choices such as quad biking, dolphin cruising, horse riding and skydiving (more on that later),''sandboarding with Alter Action''sounded the most unique to me and therefore was put at the top of my list.''Better than snow''I did fall, but it didn’t hurt much. I did get pockets, ears, hair, and a mouth full of sand, but I didn’t mind much.''Even two months later, I’m still finding sand at the bottom of my bag.''It was worth it, though, and as big kids what’s better than playing in a giant sand box?''Few things'', I’d say.''Later that evening on the beach''After the fourth run it was time to head off for skydiving with''Ground Rush Adventures''. The day was packed but it was perfect because I didn’t have any down time to think about the fact that I’d be flying through the air, tempting fate and putting all of my trust in a parachute, soon.''I wondered if it would be like bungee jumping. I still didn’t know how I felt about it a month after jumping off of''Bloukran’s bridge in South Africa'', the highest natural bungee jump in the world and the first I’d ever tried.''I met the guy I’d be jumping tandem with, Francois, and immediately felt at ease. He’s the kind of guy I’d be friends with, whether I was strapped to him and trusting him with my life or not. He approached it with such excitement and enthusiasm that it was hard for me to have any fear.''Jumping barefood ’cause I’m ’bout that life doe. And suit-less, because if I don’t get to wear those red and yellow pants then I don’t want to wear ANYTHING.''The scariest part of a skydive is the buildup. Sitting in the plane as it goes higher and higher, way past the point where it seems it should stop and with entirely too much time to think, is the worst. I was oddly relaxed and excited, though, knowing that I didn’t really have to do anything but spread my wings and fly.''“Now I’m freeee, free falling” (I am so sorry, that’s probably stuck in your head now)''The launch felt completely different to jumping off of a bridge. There was a free-fall, yes, but at that altitude and watching everything below me, felt slower and almost peaceful. When bungee jumping, my body was moving faster than my brain could comprehend, which is why the free-fall is so damn scary.\xa0The body is sending panic signals to the brain quicker than the brain can say, “it’s cool, there’s a rope strapped to you!”''Skydiving was different, the rush of warm wind – so warm that I didn’t even need a jump suit – and the gorgeous setting sent so much dopamine through my brain that I instantly fell in love with the sensation.''Before I knew it, the parachute was deployed and Francois, sensing that I wasn’t even an ounce of scared, placed the handles in my hands and said, “pull!”''Yep''I finally know how a bird feels (well a flight-less one, maybe)''SO beautiful''We spun quickly in one direction, me laughing and he pulling my hand down even harder so that we’d go faster, then in the other direction.

So I emailed her and invited her to guest post.''It turns out that the girl on the other side of the computer is a 13-year-old Australian, Réka Kaponay, who has been traveling full time since she was only 10, yet she comes\xa0across with the maturity and skill level of a\xa020-something highly educated woman in her correspondence and writing.''I was instantly fascinated by her story and asked if she would be willing to share it with you.\xa0The following are the words of a girl who has been traveling the world for the past three years:''How did this all begin?''Réka: I turned 11 in L.A. with my twin brother, Lalika, only a week after we left Australia, celebrating with one of our close family friends with a trip to the movies and the California Pizza Kitchen (CPK). To me, at the time, this was an experience to behold. Little did I know that what was waiting just around the corner was the real beginning of my journey in life, and a learning experience that I cannot begin to place a value on.''At her 11th Birthday''When we first started traveling\xa0it felt like an extended vacation, but as we went\xa0further into the USA, eventually visiting 31 of the 50 states, and later into South America, it became our journey of giving through the EnergeticXChange project –\xa0a project in the sharing/gift economy that my parents dreamed up.\xa0The idea was\xa0that for every need on the planet, there had to be an offering somewhere in the world that would meet that need. To facilitate the connection of these needs they developed a website that\xa0help people find matches. Thus, our journey began.''What is the best part about traveling?''Réka: Now we’ve traveled\xa0to 23 countries on six continents, but when you go beyond the statistics, I realise our journey is made up of the people we have encountered along the way. For me, this is how the journey is connected – in the images that live in my mind, and it is what defines the character and experiences of the places we visited. The one that immediately jumps to mind is what\xa0some might call a chance encounter (though we have learned throughout our journey, that there is no such thing).''We were picnicking with our camper parked in a small forest park in the outskirt suburbs of Raleigh, North Carolina on a balmy Saturday afternoon. Nearby, a young couple was walking on the path. My mother greeted them and they began to converse. The casual conversation lasted about an hour, resulting in an invitation for us to come and stay with them in their home, which later resulted in another invite to visit their parents on their family farm in Pennsylvania. When we arrived at the farm, Lalika and I hit the jackpot of new friends. It was a convergence of summer vacation and grandchildren, 14 in all, and we made fast friends.''With newfound friends''It was as if we had always known each other, and while we had come from opposite sides of the planet, we immediately found the common ground that children always seem to find.\xa0and still rates as one of the\xa0experiences of a lifetime for me!''The adventures we packed into those seven days would be enough for a blog on its own and a cultural exchange program to boot. In fact, friendship is one of the treasures I hold deepest to my heart on our journey.''Is it ever difficult for you?''Réka: There is a massive downside to these experiences, and that is having to say goodbye. There is just no easy way to describe this feeling, and while technology enables us to keep in touch, not knowing when we will see each other again takes a piece of my heart and puts its on hold and sometimes leaves me a little empty, even lonely.''It reinforces for me just how important real human physical connections are, and how technology while empowering us on so many levels, is also distancing us from this closeness too. On friendship, I am not entirely sure, but I feel there is an intensive nature and authenticity made from these travel friendships that somehow transcends the experience of the friendships that I have back in Australia. It doesn’t make those friendships any less valuable to me; it is just a different experience of friendship that only the traveler can know.''What has traveling taught you?''Réka: Prior to leaving for our journey, our parents had already taken Lalika and I out of the schooling system, registering us as home learners. I was already well advanced as a reader and writer and my brother in Math, both of us having taken additional English and Maths courses through an after school program.''For me learning is a privilege, a constant interest, and the world provides me with the mother of all learning experiences that I could ever want. We learn together as a family, sharing everything that we learn which makes us richer for the experience of being a family. \xa0I speak three languages now, Spanish being the most recent.\xa0I am also currently seeking an agent for my first full-length novel ‘''Dawn of The Guardian''’ an adventure tale, experienced through the eyes and perspective of a two-year-old Patterdale Terrier, living in the heart of Andalusia Spain, trying to prevent the forces of the dream world from keeping us asleep. (Kristin’s note:''Wha? Seriously? She’s writing a book too?!)''Reka with her family in South America''Throughout our journey, I have participated in many experiences of learning, including formal, indigenous (Story Telling), non-traditional and even innovative methods. While I am 13, nearly 14, whether it be from my experience of learning about ancient civilizations by standing directly on the pilgrims’ path on the Nazca Lines, or living with the''Descendants of the Incas'', or through what I have learned ‘formally’, I feel that by traveling, I have experienced enough methods of learning to be confident that\xa0I will be able to contribute to the world in a meaningful manner, and this is what is important to me. I will never stop learning as long as I live, and I can attribute this directly to the experience of traveling.''How are you managing to keep going?''Traveling has now evolved for us into a combined family project and in working together to bring our projects to fruition. For me, this means continuing to learn and share my experiences and observations of traveling through my blog.

I joined an overland safari and I would be on the truck for 35 days.''That would be 35 days of camping in a tent, without a bed, 35 days of doing chores like helping with cooking and cleaning, and 35 days of living out of a locker on a truck. It would mean 35 days of someone else doing the planning, and being surrounded by other people, not so solo anymore. Yes,''35 whole days.''Generally everything I do is solo and independent. I don’t like tours and am really not a fan of excessive hand-holding. However, I did my homework on this one and realized that if I wanted to see Namibia and the surrounding countries, it was the only safe option.''I am adventurous but I’m not stupid, and''traveling solo across Asia''with its bus system and big populations\xa0is not the same as driving a car solo across a barren, shade and water-free desert without any mechanical know-how when the possibility of seeing another car pass by is slim and cellular signal is nil.''The truck, \xa0and everyone who was on it, looking at a massive bird’s nest''What I liked about this overland safari with''Acacia\xa0Africa''was that it wasn’t an air-conditioned, fancy resort, fake experience.

This is mostly because\xa0the exchange rate does those traveling on the US Dollar or Euro a big favor. At the time of this writing, one South African Rand is equal to 8 cents US.''I could just hug it''My total expenditure for my nine weeks traveling through South Africa was $3,577, or $56/day.''This is almost a match for what I spend living in Berlin, and\xa0much cheaper than when I was living in California.''Could I have done it for even less? Yes, I absolutely could have. I generally did not live on a backpacker budget in South Africa, because after two years of dorms, I just can’t do it anymore.\xa0Since now I’m more of a flash packer, working on the road, I’m able to spend a bit more.''That said, regardless of your budget, whether it be high or low, I’ll outline how to live within it in this post:''Accommodation:''A guesthouse/hostel/tourist accommodation in South Africa is called a “backpackers.”''Whether you’re a backpacker who likes dorms or more of a flash packer who likes to have your own space but still wants a social vibe, you can find what\xa0that fits your needs at a backpackers accommodation in South Africa. Everyone from gap yearers to families, and foreigners and South Africans alike\xa0tend to stay at this type of accommodation. They’re typically in beautiful settings and each has a unique personality.''Generally backpackers\xa0have dorms that run from around $8-20 for a dorm bed and upwards of $50 for a private bungalow with a beach view.''This was what I was looking at each morning from my ensuite room at''Buccaneers in Cintsa'', for example:''GREAT value for $50 when you consider it looks like this!''To find the best accommodation options, I’d suggest talking to the fellow travelers at your first stop\xa0to see what they liked best, or you can''check my road trip post for my personal favorites''if you’d rather book ahead of time.''There are also free''Coast to Coast''books at each hostel and tourism office in South Africa which lists accommodation and activity options. What I didn’t like about it is how every single place\xa0in there was made to sound amazing. There were no real opinions! It does\xa0make for a good beach bonfire starter, though.''I also used''AirBnB''quite a bit in big cities, such as''Johannesburg''and Cape Town, where it was actually cheaper to rent a room with an ensuite bathroom than to stay in a shared dorm at a high end hostel.''Transportation:''Unlike much of Asia and Europe, there isn’t much public transportation in South Africa. There’s a metro train\xa0in Johannesburg that serves a few places and a muni bus in Cape Town but otherwise, there’s nothing. I realized when going through my transactions that a lot of my budget was spent on''Uber taxis''– which is a smartphone app connecting drivers and passengers that is a safer and cheaper alternative to taxis.''There are a few private companies such as''Baz Bus'',''Greyhound'', and''Intercape''that all\xa0provide transportation around the country, as well as an affordable''train''that serves many destinations in South Africa.''Baz Bus is specifically geared towards backpackers and offers a 21-day hop-on hop-off pass for around $350, stopping at various backpackers accommodation. However once at the destination it’s difficult to get around, and the bus doesn’t run daily. If taking the other options, you’ll have to get\xa0from the depot to your hotel which will require a taxi.''I’ve tested the busses, but feel that\xa0the best way to get around is most definitely to rent a car with several friends. Even when split amongst just two people, a car rental is more convenient and not much more expensive than any of the above options. I was very happy to have gone with this method\xa0for a few weeks myself.''Our noble steed''I go into every single option, the various costs of each, and how to find a road trip buddy in a lot more detail in my''transport post on NomadicMatt.com'', so check it out if you’re weighing your options.''In order to save money, if you can be flexible and social, catching a ride with fellow backpackers and offering up a bit of money for gas is a great way to get around as well. Callum (my road trip buddy) and I provided some rides and I was a passenger myself using this method.''Food:''Here’s where the big budget eater or saver can be, as food can be a big expense in South Africa.''It would be a mistake to avoid restaurants altogether because the meat in South Africa is top-notch. There are opportunities to try game animals such as Kudu, Springbok, Zebra, Ostrich, and even Alligator. I sampled all, and all are fabulous. A fine dining experience in South Africa is still cheaper than in most Western countries, so do yourself a favor and splurge at least once!''To save money, cook your own food. Grocery stores are plentiful and have reasonable prices. Backpackers accommodation have communal kitchens where guests can cook and store their own food. By at least cooking your own breakfast and the occasional dinner, you can save a lot of money.''Backpackers typically also offer breakfast for around $5 and nightly dinners for around\xa0$8.''Though there are some places you should stay out of for safety, especially at night, don’t fear eating in the townships. Ask locals which ones are alright to visit, but I would suggest Langa in Cape Town and Soweto in Johannesburg. The BBQ (or braai) food there is seriously good. Typically consisting of whatever meat you choose (go for the lamb or steak!), sausages, and pap (a fluffy maize dish used to scoop up the other food items on the plate with your hands), a filling meal can run as cheap as $3.''Sipping on a shared beer in a shebeen (unlicensed bar) in a township''Cheap Vs. Expensive Destinations in South Africa:''Most of the places I visited were more or less the same in terms of pricing, except for one – Cape Town. Expect to spend a lot more on accommodation and food when in Cape Town. It’s a beautiful city with lots to do from nightlife to outdoors enjoyment, but you will pay a pretty penny for it.''It is, however, beautiful (taken on the Pipeline hike near Camp’s Bay)''Apart from Cape Town, everywhere else I stayed was pretty much the same as far as accommodation and food costs. Perhaps the cheapest was the Karma backpackers in a very small town outside of''Golden Gate park''in the Free State. It was a house that the owner had repurposed and was a lovely little place to stay for a night.''Other Considerations:''Connectivity can be a bit pricey in South Africa. I spent quite a bit of money on reloading my SIM card over and over to stay connected and work on the road, laying out around $30 per 3 gigabytes of 3G for my phone. Most backpackers accommodation will also charge for use of their WiFi, assuming it’s working at all.''I should also point out that I spent about half of my visit in South Africa in accommodation that I didn’t pay for. I was lucky to meet a lot of amazing people who became friends, and was invited to stay in spare rooms on several occasions, only once with someone whom I knew\xa0prior to my travels there. South Africans are incredibly friendly and generous, so keep in mind that you may have similar luck\xa0as well!''All in all it doesn’t cost a lot to travel in South Africa, especially if you cook your own food, stay in dorms, and hitch rides, but it isn’t necessarily an\xa0easy place to travel for those on a shoestring backpacker budget. If you\xa0can spend a bit more and are looking for a great value for your\xa0money, however, South Africa is the perfect place.''I’ll be back for sure.''Have you been to South Africa?

It was developed in Stellenbosch, a gorgeous wine region located only 45 or so minutes outside of Cape Town.''Generally I’m not a red fan, but this smooth, earthy, and fruity grape has put Pinotage at the top of my wine favorites.''Prior to my visit, I’d certainly heard that South Africa had fabulous wine, but what I didn’t know was how sophisticated and competitive with the best wines in the world it would be. The other thing I couldn’t believe was how well-priced the wine is in South Africa given the superior quality.''A tasting is typically no more than 80 Rand (about $6.50), and most bottles are priced around the same. I still can’t wrap my head around how this is possible since Napa wine bottle prices are easily 10x that, but I’m certainly not complaining!''Given my love for the Pinotage, it seemed logical to go to its birthplace. The following are the best ways to enjoy Stellenbosch, involving both wine and culture:''Wine and Chocolate Pairing''Together?!''Do you love wine? Do you love chocolate?

However the chocolates at Lanzerac\xa0have been specially developed to compliment each wine, ranging from a white chocolate with lemongrass with the Sauv blanc\xa0to a dark salted cherry-flavored chocolate with the Cab.

In my case as I was there solo, he sat with me as I blended – a lovely afternoon and some great conversations.''First we sampled Syrah, Merlot, and Pinotage, the three that would go into the blend. Mixing small amounts and writing down each recipe, I went through five different blends\xa0with various amounts of each wine, along with liquid wood (it’s a thing!), and a tiny bit of sugar, before settling on my winner.\xa0No surprise here, but by the end\xa0my blend was mostly Pinotage.''Then, I put a Be My Travel Muse label on it and corked it myself. The whole experience was documented on Snapchat (@KrisLikeWhaat).''Enjoying the wine I blended two weeks later in Spitzkoppe, Namibia''Though in theory the tour is an hour and a half, I was told that the blending experience sometimes lasts all afternoon as groups get more and more into it.

The fire is out and Stellenbosch is rapidly returning to its original beauty these days, however.''The alternative was a''bike tour around the town and Stellenbosch University'', which took me back to my UC Santa Barbara days as the two campuses, full of bougainvillea flowers and white buildings, had an uncanny similarity. My guide, Raino, was a delight to bike around with, telling me all about the town’s history as a Dutch settlement and wine growing region.''The tour (which runs at 580 Rand) finished with the above wine and chocolate pairing, since we’d earned it after several hours of cycling, no?''Kayamandi''A lovely and unexpected township tour''I visited 4 different townships 6 times during my time in South Africa.

They showed me the shapes they were studying and then we all sat in a circle and sang songs. It was a touching experience and one I won’t soon forget. This tour and any of the above can be organized through the''Stellenbosch Wine Route''.''A quick word on township tours while we’re at it: I was hesitant to visit them at first. I wondered if locals were really okay with people parading through their homes taking photos, but each time, I was warmly welcomed. Moreover, the tours I took were almost exclusively one-on-one with a guide\xa0who had grown up in the township. The funds from the tour therefore go back into the community, as with\xa0the example of''NK in Soweto''putting a good chunk of his time and earnings into an orphanage in a local shantytown. I’d encourage you to visit one if you find yourself in South Africa, they’re difficult, but eye-opening and heart-warming all at the same time.''In closing, there are a lot of wine regions in South Africa that are worth visiting, but the history and culture of Stellenbosch plus the sheer volume of things to do and see there make it the perfect place to go and spend a few days getting to know South African wine. Each of the individuals at the wineries I visited were so pleasant to meet and speak with as well, which was typical of my experience in South Africa in general. As if there wasn’t so much to love about the place already, finishing up a glorious 9 weeks there in wine country was a perfect ending.''*I was a guest of the Stellenbosch tourism board, however you will never read a positive review on this blog unless I truly enjoyed and would recommend the experience.

A lovely reader of mine tagged her friend in the status comments and a few minutes later, we had chatted a bit and cemented a plan. Callum turned out to be a totally awesome road trip buddy, as was expected when on the first night we found out we’re presently reading the exact same book:''Thinking, Fast and Slow''.''Our first day consisted of visiting the Rhino and Lion nature reserve and the Cradle of humankind, which is site of the oldest known human remains and therefore is regarded as the origin of humans. That’s pretty cool.''The reserve seemed nothing short of awesome. I saw animals I’d grown up reading about in children’s books and in movies like the''Lion King''. Within a few minutes of entering the reserve my inner six-year-old was so impressed that my levels of euphoria were breaking the odometer, so to speak.''I saw Wildebeests (which is what I jokingly refer to myself as when I take a horrible picture), ostrich, cheetahs, and endangered wild dogs. Most amazing of all, I saw lions, quite up close and personal (check out the video!). I noted their big roaming areas, lack of chains and obvious room to be the wild animals they are. I felt so differently about it than, say Tiger Kingdom in Thailand because these cats are given lots of room, aren’t hit with bamboo poles and the proceeds don’t go towards building a temple. Some locals had also recommended it to me, Google turned up nothing negative on the park, and''TripAdvisor''had rather glowing reviews, so all seemed well.''Wild dogs are severely endangered. This reserve has successfully bred several in captivity''I posted about it and, to my surprise, started getting full-on attacked for my photo on Twitter. The comments quickly turned unconstructive and nasty, but since I don’t believe complex and nuanced discussions can happen with 140 characters, I largely ignored the trolls.''That''really''pissed them off.''My silence apparently means I “don’t care”''I’ve graduated to idiot!''…and the pinnacle: a monster who profits. If only a single tweet were that lucrative! (BTW @CMJordaan – grammar mistake. Would be a person ‘who’ profits. You’re welcome)''What is canned hunting?''I told them I’d provide my thoughts in a blog post, but this post is not for the trolls. It’s for the concerned reader who wants to put his/her tourism dollars in the right place.''Canned hunting means taking cubs from their mothers several days after birth and letting tourists pet them up until a certain age. They are in breeding facilities, or even pubs''like in this account'', that breed lions for an eventual sale to game hunting operations which let tourists hunt lions for an exorbitant price tag so that they can have pictures next to these majestic creatures like that of''Melissa Bachmann''.''I find this practice abhorrent and would never intentionally support it. The question is whether I unwittingly did so by visiting the Rhino and Lion Park.''What I found out (or rather, didn’t)''I did some research behind the claims on Twitter, but many of the links sent to me either weren’t relevant to this reserve or said heated words in a PETA-like fashion but didn’t link to any reputable sources on the matter.''What’s his destiny?''I thought about which organizations I really trust on the matter, and elected to look at the World Wildlife Fund South Africa and the National Wildlife Trust, surprisingly neither of whom even touched or addressed lion interaction on their websites. So I sent emails.''I heard nothing back.''I emailed the reserve I visited with the listed concerns.''I heard nothing back.''I was also sent a list of''good and bad places to volunteer'', but did not find the reserve I visited on either list, presumably because they don’t take volunteers. I contacted the page admin to ask how they compiled their list and was told\xa0it was based on their own research and\xa0“blogs and opinions.” I asked for clarification on that\xa0and was told they’re working on better research practices and that hard facts are very hard to find. I agree with that sentiment and for now, for lack of anything better to go by, would tend to trust their listings.''On Captivity''Is it conservation or profit? Are they mutually exclusive?''There’s the argument that animal interaction and zoos allow people to have experience with animals so that they can develop a respect for or at least become more aware of them and the need to preserve their species. Others would argue that any kind of captivity is mistreatment of the animals. I have to admit I’m on the fence on this one because people have led to both the destruction and the preservation of various species of animals, so there is unquestionably a need for some positive and educational exposure, somehow.''Without interaction, I’m not sure how this can be achieved.''In China you can hug a panda, in Australia you can hold a Koala, in Thailand you can''interact with elephants'', and in Sumatra you can trek in search of''semi-wild Orangutans''. In all of these cases, the question can be presented, is any animal interaction ethical?''Sometimes lion parks claim to release cubs back into the wild, which is possible up to a certain age, but the question is whether there are many, or rather\xa0any, wild lions or places for them to live left in South Africa.''Uh, what? Why is it so hard to get reliable info?''I had been told and believed\xa0that the lion would join the other adults in the reserve once it was older since it is fact that''males will kill cubs'', and that the endangered white Tigers (which the park claimed are there as part of an effort to breed them and grow their population) would eventually go to a zoo or be given their own enclosure.''Perhaps that was naïve.''In conclusion''In his large enclosure – is this unethical?''The fact of the matter is, ethics comes down to opinion. This is why my blog is not chiefly\xa0about ethical tourism, because frankly, it’s subjective, and those who think they know more than others on sensitive matters often sit on a pedestal and ridicule those who unwittingly make a mistake or simply see something differently.''People ride elephants in Thailand only to find out later that it’s horrendous for their spines and they’re tortured into submission at an early age, eat a steak from a cow that never roamed freely, buy an iPhone not realizing that the conditions at the factories in China are heinous, or drink a coke not knowing that they’re supporting a company that often takes''the only water resource''in rural villages in developing countries.''The right thing can often only be done in retrospect.''At the end of this I’m sorry to say that my research is inconclusive. I don’t know that any lion parks are ethical or that 100% of cubs for petting are later shot and killed.\xa0However, I don’t want to\xa0accidentally support a sinister industry, and rather than cover up my experience, I’m admitting to you that I may have made a mistake.''Since I can’t be sure either way, my personal plan is to seek''animals only in the wild from now onward''at a safe distance while on safari. What you do is up to you. My job is to present the facts, not hearsay, and to let you decide what you think is right. Unfortunately I couldn’t find any.''I believe there are both good and bad reserves here in South Africa, just like there are good and bad zoos all around the world.''In closing, I’ve said what I have to say on the matter, and this is not a battle I wish to wage any further.\xa0I welcome you to leave constructive (but please no attacks – they’re not productive) comments on your position or opinion on what responsible tourism means to you, and how you go about putting your money to the right places when you travel.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Three of the Best Places in Southern Africa for Safari''Wildlife in Namibia: Finding Life in Africa’s Desert Country''How to Get Wildlife Photos Your Friends Will Love – Go to Botswana''Last week I departed my beloved (but cold and dark) Berlin in favor of summer, and after 24 hours of travel, landed in Johannesburg, South Africa, with weather reminiscent of back home in Southern California.''I almost didn’t know what to make of it at first.

Check out their''calendar of events''for yoga and musical acts.''Sunset on the canal''The canal that runs through Kreuzberg is a favorite for locals and visitors during the sunset hours. Buy a beer from the local späti (a small convenience\xa0store that sells drinks, candy, and the like) and take it over to the banks, especially in the summer months, and you’ll find that you’re in good company.''My favorite spot is at''Admiralbrücke''. Keep an eye open for the guy who peddles samosas, the swans, and the locals in blow up rafts\xa0selling beer.''Badeschiff''Photo by''Nate Bolt''used under creative commons''On a hot day during the summer in Berlin, this floating swimming pool on the river Spree is the place to be. Sure, it’s known by tourists and has a €5 price tag, but if you’re looking to meet cool people at the closest thing to a beach party that you’ll find in landlocked Berlin, it’s a great spot.''What many might not know is that it’s not only open during the summertime. Badeschiff is open during the winter, too, offering saunas and heated pools.''Urban Spree''At RAW''If you can’t get enough street art (and really, who can?), this spot next to the Warschauer str S-bahn station is full of it. Plus, there’s a lot going on there like musical events, nightclubs, a Sunday flea market, a rock climbing wall, movie nights, one of the biggest indoor halfpipes in Europe, and outdoor bars when the weather is nice.''It’s one of my favorite spots for street art gazing and hanging out. Just be sure to keep an eye on your belongings, as''pickpockets''have a field day there (and that goes for all of Berlin).''Bite Club''Bite club''is a summertime street food party that takes place every third Friday at Arena Berlin, which isn’t too far from the Badeschiff if you feel like combining noms and pool time.''If you’re here during the colder months and still want to find some great street food, check out the Markthalle Neun in Kreuzberg on Thursdays.

They say that about''Burning Man'', too.''Too all of the naysayers, I say “I don’t care.”''That’s why I moved to Berlin.''READ NEXT: Which Neighborhood in Berlin Suits You Best?''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''Underground Berlin: The Fringes of Society''The Ultimate Berlin Guide: What to Do, See, and Eat!''Which Berlin Neighborhood Should You Stay in?''These days, there are millions upon millions of blogs. Of those, a good amount are travel blogs, and new ones are constantly emerging. There’s a pretty obvious way, as I see it, to tell the really golden ones from the duds that won’t last for long.''It’s the writing. It’s the skill level and level of authority on the subject. It’s the conversational tone. It’s the feeling that I’m being let into their world, how they think, and what they really like to experience when traveling. \xa0Those are the blogs I keep coming back to over and over.''In some cases, I came to meet and get to know the person after already discovering the\xa0blog, but in most, I don’t know the writer at all. Yet\xa0I search their blogs before I even search Google when I want travel ideas or need to be uplifted.''The following are the best blogs you should be reading if you love travel as much as I do. Both old and new, popular and up-and-coming, and drawn from a large range of niches and focuses, these are my favorites:''Alex in Wanderland''I knew about Alex’s blog when I first started traveling and blogging, and even emailed her when I had questions about SCUBA diving (she spends a lot of time as an underwater videographer on Koh Tao in Thailand). However, it wasn’t until relying on her post about''Elephant Falls in Da Lat'', Vietnam\xa0that I started to read her regularly after realizing that we have a similar travel style.''I feel like I know Alex even though I don’t. Her personality shines through in both her writing and her pictures. She manages never to come off as anything but kind and lovely rather than authoritative and commanding. Her post,''Gratitude at Twenty Five'', so eloquently describes the amazing years she’s had traveling and is a great way to get to know her blog if you don’t already.''Expert Vagabond''Simply put, Matt does cool stuff and he goes to really cool places. As far as those who travel off the beaten path in a genuine way, I look to Matt for new ideas for destinations and for his awesome photos. He’s adventurous and outdoorsy and I was delighted to get the chance to hang out and''accidentally rock climb''with him when we happened to be in Thailand at the same time.''A few months ago, he surprised me again with''My Caveman Experience: Squatting with Gypsies in Spain''. He tends to shine light on the things society is scared of or doesn’t\xa0know as much about, and that’s why I keep reading, because I know he’ll make an awesome discovery and illustrate it with really well-captured photos.''Daniel McBane''Daniel was my go-to guru while traveling in China. His posts are helpful, full of practical information, and most importantly, refreshingly honest. If Daniel really likes something, you know. The same is true if he really doesn’t like something. After following a lot of his practical advice on''traveling in the more remote areas in China'', I wouldn’t hesitate to follow his advice again (as I did in Nepal).''Zen Pencils''Zen pencils is not a travel blog, but rather an inspirational series of comics that Gav expertly chooses and illustrates perfectly. \xa0A lot of what he chooses to illustrate could be considered controversial and it’s almost always unexpected. He chooses notable people who talk about breaking the norm, questioning the institutions that put forth ideas we often take for a given throughout our lives, and push the idea of following one’s passions.''Though so many of his are amazing, and the perfect pick-me-up when I need inspiration or a reminder that I’m still on a path to growth even if it’s not meteoric, my favorite is his illustration of''Bill Hicks: It’s just a ride''.''Nomadic Matt''Matt’s most likely seems a natural blog for me to mention here, particularly because I am now a regular monthly columnist on his site, but his is actually the first travel blog I read. When I first started researching long-term travel online, Matt’s was the first one that opened my eyes to the possibility of travel as a lifestyle. I had no idea before reading articles like the''Ultimate Guide to Traveling When You Have No Money''that I could do it, too.''That’s why it’s such a pleasure to be more involved with his site now, but I genuinely would consistently check back at Matt’s site regardless of that. He’s the unquestionable expert when it comes to budget travel.''Wait But Why''Wait But Why is a blog I initially discovered because he had written such a brilliant piece on choosing a life partner, and why we normally rush into it and all of the other mistakes that go into it. He is amazingly good at breaking down human habits and observing them as if he had an outside perspective of the human race.''What makes his blog great for travel addicts is his Odd Things in Odd Places series, which saw him visiting unlikely places such as Nigeria, Greenland,''and Iraq''. But his posts are not just the standard, “I went here and I saw this.” Each one has a great deal of historical background and cultural research that goes into it. In short, Tim knows his stuff.''Bacon is Magic''Ayngelina is another one of those writers who keeps it\xa0real. Completely real. She left a stable career and boyfriend at 30 to travel solo for a year in South America. Apart from liking her because she seemed like\xa0a total badass, I gained a lot of my solo traveling courage from her words.''Refreshingly honest, open, and''full of love and loss''that just about everyone has experienced, I love reading her blog partially\xa0because it guided me through some of the toughest times I had at home and on the road.''Waegook Tom''I love reading expat blogs because they tend to have a much better insight into the peculiarities of various cultures and places than those who move around frequently, as I suppose I do. Tom used to teach English in South Korea and it was both''the cultural observations''and the really funny, personal, whimsical way that he writes that had me returning to read more.''When he moved to Taiwan, it became even more fun for me to read his blogs because I used to live there as well, and certainly can identify with the culture though it’s interesting to see how it has changed in my absence over the past 7(?!) years.''Wandering Earl''If you read travel blogs at all, then you’re probably familiar with Wandering Earl. His is one of the first blogs I ever read and became hooked to after''Please Don’t Be Afraid to Travel On Your Own''. I have re-read that post, and sent it along to friends who are on the fence about traveling, many times over the past few years.''He was the first to show me how easy it is to meet people on the road. That post truly made a big impact and was hugely important for me to read during the early days of my travel planning. He let me know this lifestyle is possible solo. For that, I’ll always be a fan.''Mark Manson''Mark has been a location independent world traveler for five years. While his blog does not focus on travel, per se, it focuses on ambition, self-worth, discipline, and becoming a more effective communicator, leader, and human being in general. I read almost every single blog that Mark puts out, but his''7 Strange Questions That Help You Find Your Life Purpose''is a recent one that really stood out for its look at finding what makes you tick.''For a lot of people, pursuing a passion or creating a life they’re happy to live every day is the one thing they’re most afraid to do. I know, I was one of them. But reading blogs like this reminds me of why I’m doing what I’m doing and reaffirms my choices to pursue a location independent lifestyle,''even if it’s not as lucrative''as what I did before.''Rog Law Fitness''Bear with me as this is not a typical travel blog recommendation. Rog’s blog is the first one I started reading''after''meeting the person in real life and becoming friends. He’s a digital nomad who trains people in fitness and\xa0reaching their life goals. He’s also completely hilarious and a great motivational writer.''When his post titled,''The Unbearable Lightness of Not Giving a Fuck: Why Caring Less Helps You Live More'', popped up on my newsfeed, I had to click and read simply for the clever title (an allegory of the philosophical novel,''The Unbearable Lightness of Being''). Then I read and realized that everything he said was incredibly spot on. Not only that, it had me laughing out loud constantly.\xa0His focus is on pushing out the negativity and that’s a very important skill to develop in life.''—''Though there are a lot of awesome blogs out there that cover relevant things and are written by super talented bloggers, many of whom I consider friends, these are the ones in my heavy rotation at the moment.

Whether it be a book or an online publication, reading has been such a great way to learn more about each culture I’m in, to figure out how to develop income streams, and even how to better understand interpersonal relationships.''This particular list is a set of my favorites for traveling in Asia. Each of them sheds some light on the cultures and many are autobiographical. One thing they all have in common is they are each incredibly compelling reads.''This is an ever growing and evolving list as I find more great reads to add, but for the time being, here are\xa0the books that I’ve read from cover to cover over the past two years and would absolutely recommend that you do the same:''Cambodia''First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers''by Loung Ung''This is easily one of the most powerful books I have ever read and is one of the best insights into Cambodia’s troubled past. It helped me appreciate even more the vibrant, smiling people Cambodians are today. \xa0It details the loss, hardship, and ugly realities\xa0of the Pol Pot regime from 1975 onward in Cambodia in such a way that brought tears to my eyes more than once while reading.''It wasn’t easy to get through and there were times when my hair was standing straight up on my arms, immersing myself in the story of this remarkable woman’s childhood. More than that, her strength and courage shines through as the reader watches her turn from a spoiled city child to a strong, independent fighter. For those traveling in Cambodia, understanding the genocide is important to understanding how the country has become what it is today.''Thailand''Miss Bangkok: Memoirs of a Thai Prostitute''by Bua Boonmee''First of all, I don’t meant to say that this book is everything you need to know about Thailand or its vibrant culture, but there is no denying that\xa0a great many people come to Thailand as sex tourists. This book really helped highlight how some women come to end up in the sex business, and it is''incredibly''eye-opening.''I won’t give away any more than that, but suffice to say, it’s a powerful story and one that shed some light on the reasons behind why some of these women do what they do in order to survive. I’m willing to bet many of the patrons of the\xa0Thai sex industry\xa0have no idea about the harsh realities behind the curtain.''Vietnam''Catfish and Mandala: A Two-Wheeled Voyage Through the Landscape and Memory of Vietnam''by Andrew X. Pham''This book was\xa0a compelling page-turner written by an author who truly has a gift for writing. I felt like reading his words helped me grow as a writer, as a traveler in Vietnam, and even as an American. Andrew X. Pham was born in war-torn Vietnam and he and his family risked their lives to come to the United States as refugees when he was a child. He grew up as a quasi-outsider in the US and as an adult, only to feel the same feeling as an outsider in his birth country. His objective was to cycle through the country, and while this would have been a compelling enough story, it’s really the cultural reflections and Andrew’s feelings and difficulties that made it so interesting for me.''I personally''really loved visiting Vietnam''. As a white American, it’s amazing how different our experiences ended up being. If you read this before or even during a tip to Vietnam, you’ll be moved.''Nepal''Little Princes: One Man’s Promise to Bring Home the Lost Children of Nepal''by Conor Grennan''Little Princes is the first book I read during my travels in Southeast Asia. It left a lasting impact as I made my own way to Nepal less than a year and a half later. Grennan’s self-deprecating writing style in the beginning endeared me to him as a reader, and made it easy to empathize with him throughout the book as he made astonishing discovery after astonishing discovery about orphanages in Nepal.''Whether you plan to visit Nepal or not, this is a fantastic read and one that I have recommended over and over to friends and family.''Sold''by Patricia McCormick''Sold is a novel based on the true stories of thousands of girls smuggled from Nepal to India to become sex slaves. While this is certainly not a feel good book with puppies and rainbows jumping out of every page, I sometimes think reads like this are important to understanding the world \xa0in every aspect – the good and the bad. Through awareness and education, there can be growth and change.''Any Buddhist Country''(Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, parts of China, the list goes on)''What Makes You Not a Buddhist''by\xa0Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse''The title of this book really is misleading. \xa0It seems like it’s going to be a long, dry, boring account of the religion when in reality, it’s a genius, engaging, and easy-to-understand explanation of Buddhism as a philosophy towards life, love, and loss. Though I’m not a religious person, this book truly did change my life and outlook for the better. It helped me understand change, what is really important in life, helped me grasp compassion, and to let go of anger.''I know that’s a lot for one book to do, but it opened a world to me that I otherwise couldn’t quite understand given my Western background and upbringing. The author does a great job of explaining Buddhism in a Western framework without pushing Buddhism as a religion, making it appropriate for\xa0people of any religious or cultural background. It was a super helpful intro for me before going into a''10-day silent meditation in Thailand''. In short, it just seeks to help spread understanding.''This is the book I recommend the most to friends of mine who are traveling, going through a transformative time, or simply looking for a better understanding of life in general. Best of all, all the proceeds are donated.''Everywhere in Asia''Conquering Mountains: How to Solo Travel the World Fearleassly''I wrote this guidebook after three years of traveling by myself, two of which I spent in Asia. I’ve gone back after 5 years of consecutive solo travel and updated it with new information as well, including how to get over the fear of traveling alone, how to save up, how to stay safe on the road, how to save up, earn, and save money on the road, and have included a bunch of case studies and advice from other solo female travelers as well. This is the most comprehensive resource out there for women traveling alone!''Everywhere in Southeast Asia''A Thousand New Beginnings: Tales of Solo Female Travel in Southeast Asia''is a memoir I wrote during the first year that I traveled alone in Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It’s the personal account of deciding to leave my job and boyfriend to travel solo with a one-way ticket and nothing but a carry-on backpack.''It includes excerpts from this blog, along with a lot of entries from my diary that I never posted, including falling in love, nursing heartbreak, and finding surprises on the road at every turn.''—''I read all of my books on a''Kindle''because my goal of traveling light would be quite hampered by large books.

Let’s just say I’d rather not repeat that meal.''Just about a month ago in South Tyrol, Italy, however, which I visited just as they were finishing up the harvest season, it was a local thanksgiving tradition known as Törggelen.''The lovely Church in Bolzano, the town I stayed at in South Tyrol''The Culture''This particular region in Alpine Italy is, historically, a meeting point between Italians and Germans starting in the middle ages.''Over time it has changed hands,\xa0and is\xa0now a region of Italy that maintains its own locally-run and funded public transport and public services. Locals\xa0joke that it’s good for tourists because it’s a beautiful part of Italy to visit, but things work like in Germany. Though I’ve only lived in Berlin for a short time, I know what that means: like clockwork.''All through the region I heard people speaking both German and Italian to each other.''“How do you know which to speak with someone?” I asked my local friend Deborah. “You just''feel''it,” she replied.''Right.''The daily fruit market in Bolzano''This side of the Alps gets twice as many sunny days as in Austria, yet from the snowmelt has no shortage of clean,\xa0“soft”\xa0water, has mind-blowingly gorgeous countryside, world-class skiing,''rock climbing on world-famous mountains'', and truly has a culture and all its own.''The beautiful autumn leaves – Take a walk in South Tyrol''Food wise, this is also true. South Tyrol is known for growing delicious apples (I can vouch), developing\xa0a deliciously salty and flavorful smoked and cured meat called speck, and producing delicious wine and beer as well, among many other things.''The Wine''White wine from freshly-harvested grapes''I really liked learning about the wine in this region, mostly because it tasted so good and seemed a rare treat that is not widely available around the world.''South Tyrol is the smallest region in Italy for wine production, representing only 1% of the market. Since all of the flat areas in this mountainous region are devoted to apple growing, most farmers here have small mountainside farms. Therefore, it’s hard for many of them to have large, private wineries.''For this reason, many wineries here work on a co-op model. The farmers each contribute their harvest for the season to a local winery, and all profits after the production and sale of the wine are redistributed back to the farmers. While it’s typical in Italy for about 30% of wineries to work using this method, here in South Tyrol, it’s more like 70%.''This winery,''Cantina Valle Iscaro'', offers private wine tours and tastings. I even had the chance to explore with the new General Manager, who then served up some of the best wine I have ever tasted.''After each glass I found myself asking, “so is this available in Berlin?”''Where grape juice becomes wine (i.e. where the magic happens)''The Thanksgiving Feast''I use the term,\xa0“Thanksgiving” loosely, as\xa0Törggelen occurs over the course of an entire month and is celebrated with harvest festivals and long meals of several courses shared with friends, family, and co-workers. During the course of the autumn season, Deborah tells me that she typically attends\xa0Törggelen at least 2-3 times.''The meal is served in a farm house which raises the pigs and grapes on the property. The subsequent harvest, slaughter, and production of all of the foods and beverages enjoyed over the course of the\xa0Törggelen all come from the very farm the meal is enjoyed at. Talk about farm-to-table goodness!''The feast kicks off with speck, which if you have familiarity with''proscuitto (cured and salted pork leg)'', has its similarities though speck is smoked and unique to South Tyrol.''It is also highly addictive and one must exercise great restraint to not fill up on speck before the rest of the meal rolls out.''Must…resist…the speck''Also featured is a thin, hard cracker with anise seeds inside, another food unique to South Tyrol and often consumed in conjunction with speck.''What typically follows this appetizer is the vegetable soup, again featuring veggies that have been picked on the farm:''As you can see, I’m still in training mode on my food photography''The next course features light, fried pieces of bread that reminded me of a lighter, savory version of a''Southern\xa0beignet'', served with sauerkraut.''Seriously? There’s more?''This is where the meal started to get difficult, because I had run out of room and, as Deborah warned might happen, had filled up on speck.''I’m not a quitter, though, and managed to resist filling up on too much bread before the main event arrived, which was freshly-made pork sausage.''With a plate of sausage in front of me and hearing the German language spoken around me, it really felt to me like I was back in Germany, yet remembering the speck and drinking the wine, it was clear I was still in Italy.''Sausage, in Italy!''Partway through the meal, the owner of the home and chief farmer extraordinaire gave us and other diners who asked a tour of the various rooms where the wine is made and the slaughter, smoking, and aging take place. It really blew me away how much work was involved and how incredibly local and fresh my meal had been.''All around us, tables full of people laughed, played cards, and drank the young wine – somewhere in the aging process between grape juice and wine, but still very much fermented.''The meal finished with pastry and the crown jewel: roasted chestnuts. As is typical with me, I did not photograph dessert because I tend to eat it before thinking. Who feels me on that one?''Though a longer meal than I’m typically used to, I really enjoyed this Thanksgiving feast and was happy to have discovered this truly unique, special corner\xa0of Italy.''Have you ever celebrated Thanksgiving in another country? What were the biggest differences?''Do it yourself:''Getting there:''Reach Bolzano by train. From there, it is best to rent a car or book some kind of transport if you want to enjoy\xa0Törggelen. It is also possible to take the bus or a tour. The only problem I foresee with the bus is missing the last one home, or being unable to reach the exact location of the farm house. For this reason you may prefer private transport.''Eat:''This particular\xa0Törggelen took place at\xa0Oberpartegger Hof. Typical cost is a very reasonable €30-40 including drinks.''Contact them to book''for next October (though you may want someone who speaks German or Italian to help with the booking, such as your hotel concierge or the tourism board).''Fair warning, if you do\xa0take part in\xa0Törggelen, expect it to take 4-5 hours. Bring some playing cards, a designated driver, and a big appetite. If you tend to get uncomfortable sitting for long periods of time, bring along a cushion to sit on or see if the hosts might have some extra, as the seating is wooden bench-style''I also highly recommend eating venison and\xa0kastanien hertz (“heart of the chestnut” – a chocolate covered dessert with cream and chestnut) when visiting South Tyrol during this time – both are amazing''Stay:''In Bolzano I stayed at''Hotel Greif''which had the most amazing breakfast buffet ever, amen (inclusive of cheesecake and wine)''*Disclaimer: This post was brought to you in collaboration with the Tourism Board in South Tyrol.

I will always have a soft spot in my heart for them and I still believe they’re the best way to meet other solo travelers, I had said before that my backpacking days are likely behind me. Therefore, the challenge becomes finding these quirky and boutique BnB-type places.''Luckily it’s made much easier with the ability to set up my plans in this visual kind of way and having access to others’ recommended\xa0hotels as well.

I searched Hotel Greif in Bolzano, Italy and found that Yonderbound came back with $240 and was pretty surprised to see the other two websites I normally alternate between come back with $242, which was before the fees both websites impose.''This place has the. best. breakfast. ever. amen.''It’s just a few dollars per night but that does add up when you travel all year long!

I’ve seen a lot of travel bloggers in there and I naturally tend to look at those because I know the reviewers are experts in these areas and may have even stayed in the same place.''Yonderbox suggestions''Lastly, and what I find of huge value, is anyone who books through the''Yonderboxes''that you have created, which you can send to friends, family, whomever, helps you build more yonder-credits which can be used towards future bookings.\xa0As a travel blogger it’s a perfect way for me to recommend my favorite hotels directly to you guys, and to see what your favorite hotels are. Double win for me.''I definitely think at the moment, Yonderbound is perfect for mid-range to high-end hotels and a great way to plan if you have multiple people to inform.

It’s high in the mountains and from the nearest city – Deqen – can only be reached via 15km by foot or mule. In Yubeng\xa0the chickens, donkeys, and pigs run around anywhere they want, the locals dress brightly, and the air is crisp and clean.''It’s a sacred area and all along the''trail to Yubeng''prayer flags are strung along the trees. I’ve never been anywhere as peaceful in my life. The white snow, the tall peaks, the running water, the steaming chicken hot pot, the ever-present silence and reflection, and the lovely people still give me a feeling of grace and peace when I think of it.''Pai, Thailand''Hanging out in Pai''I talk about Pai all the time. In life,''in this blog'', in my dreams. I just love it there and it feels like such a hippie paradise. I could get stuck listening to reggae, eating amazing inventive eggs benedict at Boomelicious and play with fire at the Circus School all day.''I could visit the''Land Split'', swim in the waterfalls, and drink iced coffees all day as well, and usually do some combination of all of the aforementioned in the span of just one afternoon.

Why not? It’s paradise incarnate\xa0with its white sand beaches and perfect clear blue water.''Don Det, Laos''If only you could see the double rainbow!''Don Det is the first place I’ve ever seen a double rainbow. I was floating down the Mekong river in an inner tube and right before me, stretching from one bank to the other, was the most perfect double rainbow at the most perfect time that it could have appeared.''It’s easy to laze away in''Don Det'', reading, swaying in a hammock, riding a bike around, and just existing in that river world.''Dali, China''Even the heavens agree, Dali’s chill''I didn’t expect to see hippies in China, and then I arrived in Dali.''Dali has everything from the old man still living in a traditional house, wearing traditional clothing, growing a full fu manchu and a smoking long-stem pipe, to the dreadlocked rasta Chinese guy in his early 30s selling handmade bracelets on the steps of the main street.''Dali is relaxed'', it sits on a beautiful lake, and Chinese and Western tourists both absolutely love it.''Tonsai Beach, Thailand''I <3 you, Tonsai''Tonsai beach, located off of Krabi and not to be confused with the Tonsai on Koh Phi Phi, is gorgeous.

I couldn’t believe how much I learned and appreciated about this new country in that short stretch of time. If you find yourself in Malta, here’s how to make the most of it:''1) Visit a church''There are 365 churches in Malta – one for every day of the year! Ergo, it is not at all difficult to Church-gaze in Malta all darn\xa0day if you want to. Some churches offer free entry while others, such as the golden-bedazzled Saint John’s Co-Cathedral,\xa0have an entrance ticket fee.''Churches in Europe have been a way to display a region’s prosperity throughout history. \xa0The Catholic Church in Malta historically has been quite rich, due in part to\xa0with the status given to\xa0the wealthy elite who have made sizable contributions to making them beautiful and well-preserved, so both large and small, the churches are quite\xa0impressive.''2) See one of the largest domes in Europe''A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Oct 10, 2014 at 11:15pm PDT''The\xa0Mosta Dome is one of the largest domes in Europe.

If you love rabbit as much as I do, or especially if you haven’t tried it before and you’re curious, Malta is just the place.''I didn’t get to try it myself, but after a quick search on Trip Advisor, it looks like a fan favorite for the dish is at''Charlie’s Inn''.''7) Take a boat ride around the 3 ancient cities''A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse)''on''Oct 10, 2014 at 3:34pm PDT''A row-boat ride around the three ancient cities in the harbor, departing from Birgu, only cost €10 and can easily be split between a few passengers.

I’m not aware of many, or rather any, places where this is true.''Pin me!''24) Take a dive''I regret that I didn’t have a chance to go SCUBA diving in Malta. It’s a popular place for the sport, though, and something I would definitely do if visiting Malta in the future.''25)\xa0Get a private driver''If you want to be able to do the bulk of the aforementioned in an equally short period of time, it is much more easily done with a driver and guide than solo navigating. Though I’m not a big fan of group tours, a private one with a guide is a really wonderful way to get to know a place, affording you a chance to directly ask questions and see all of the things that you, personally, have interest in seeing. You might be surprised by how affordable it can be in Malta!''In closing, Malta is the kind of place that you don’t need a lot of time to enjoy.

During this period of time I have rarely spent more than a few days in each place, and never stayed anywhere for more than two months (the longest was my most recent summer in Berlin). I also rarely spent longer than a few days in any one individual’s\xa0company, with a few exceptions.''Pin me!''Solo traveling is something I’ve advocated ever since I began traveling, and while I still believe it has all kinds of positive benefits, I acknowledge that any kind of radical life shift, especially one maintained over a long period of time, will also come with drawbacks.''While traveling has taught me more over the past two years about the world than I could ever have hoped to learn without that kind of exposure to other cultures and belief systems,''it has also taught me a lot about the world within''. Here are 10 ways that traveling has changed me, and inevitably tends to change everyone in a similar situation:''1) It breeds selfishness''Solo traveling narrows down the direct impact of nearly every choice to one person – you. Decisions ranging from the smaller,''what should I eat today?''s to the larger,''which country would I like to visit next''?s, all fall to you. Unless you’ve met someone(s) you want to remain with longer, or are making a more major decision like whether or not to go home for an important holiday or life event, the vast majority of what you do is governed and experienced by you and you alone.''This can make it pretty hard to commit to any kind of relationship because suddenly, you have to start considering the desires of others and can’t be as selfish anymore.''2) It removes filters and exposes you to\xa0your real self''Traveling solo, particularly in developing\xa0countries, removes most external influences that caused us to make decisions in our\xa0lives back home: jobs, relationships, rent costs, image, ads, television, etc.''When you’re\xa0in places where nobody wears designer anything, a $3 dorm room is perfectly normal, and street food is a favorite staple, even for those who also come from a corporate background, the B.S. is removed and people can be who they want to be.''People say that traveling makes them into a new person, but I believe it just allows them to be who they’ve always been. Maybe that’s\xa0someone who freely enjoys excess, turns into a Buddhist, devotes his/her life to helping others, or\xa0a whole host of other lifestyles.''3) You realize you can actually do whatever you want''All it takes sometimes!''So many people say to me, “I wish I could do what you do,” or “you’re so brave,” but what they don’t realize is''they''can''do what I’m doing and I’m''not''that brave''. Anyone traveling solo also knows this to be true.''What seems so simple to me now, but I didn’t put enough emphasis on before, is the fact that we get only one shot at\xa0life and pursuing major dreams is not just important, it’s a necessity. Yet so many people don’t end up trying the very thing they most wish they could in life for fear of failure. The whole point is to realize it’s never a failure, but a series of steps forward and inevitably a few backwards.''4)\xa0Your profound realizations will make you sound like an a**hole''Any time someone praises you for following your dreams you’ll be forced to tell them that they could do the same thing. They, too, could simply do whatever the heck they want. They’ll stare back at you in disbelief, and\xa0you’ll feel like you’re on a soap box.''Then you’ll step down, sheepishly.''5) Friends and family become much more precious''My mom says that these days she sees me more than when I was living in California, only 45 minutes away. Now when I come home, I stay with her and each year,''she has visited me''for a week or two during my travels. My best friends from back home also take time off of work and plan group trips when I’m home. A couple of them have even''visited me in Thailand''(during the coup d’etat, no less).''I’ve also seen friends I’ve met traveling over and over, in different countries and continents. We make effort to see each other because we made lasting friendships.''You’ll meet people from all over the world, and while you’ll say goodbye a lot, you’ll also have the opportunity to hang out with a friend in just about every city you visit. This is an incredible gift.''6) People will\xa0rely on you less''By juxtaposition, the fact that you’re always leaving, always moving, and never letting yourself stay in one place for long will make you\xa0less of a long-term-prospect in many people’s lives. This is particularly true for romantic relationships.''It’s hard to take someone seriously who will always leave, which results in a lot of heartbreak and goodbyes.''7) There’s no cure-all, no perfect lifestyle, and no answer to all of your problems''People think riches are the answer until they become rich, think fame is the answer until they become famous, and think traveling will be the perfect lifestyle change until they realize that no lifestyle is without its pitfalls. It can be a bitter pill to swallow.''8) Home will be harder to find''With so many options constantly presenting themselves, and by returning to the place where you grew up with a\xa0new perspective,''it will be harder to feel at home in any one place''.''This inevitable byproduct of traveling is a double-edged sword, because you’ll end up falling in love with many places while simultaneously wondering if you could ever really settle in one place.''9) If you can’t be a chameleon, it won’t be easy''Master the art of blending in!''Unless you can embrace the differences in each friend group, culture, and overall lifestyle where you’re living, it won’t be an easy road. When I’m traveling, I realize that things will not be as clean, timetables will probably not exist, the people I’m around are more likely to be from different cultures\xa0with very little in common with how I grew up.''Back home, I realize that image matters more and I can’t just walk around without makeup or western-style clothing on if I want to be treated with respect.''Traveling successfully means\xa0that in order to fit in and appreciate each place, you have to change a little bit each time. Some would say this means not being true to yourself,\xa0but in reality it’s\xa0just letting different parts of your personality show.''10) You’ll never be the same again''Normalcy will be almost impossible to grasp. Reverse culture shock will be real. Assimilating to the world of non-travelers, should you ever decide to become one again, will be more difficult than you ever imagined.''In closing, traveling opens a lot of doors, promotes the opportunity to have amazing and eye-opening experiences in beautiful places, and exposes you to all kinds of amazing people. It also means a lot of changes to your lifestyle and sense of self.

California when I was a child was a child’s paradise, I was healthy, well fed, well clothed, well housed.

It’s like running into your high school boyfriend and seeing that he\xa0is exactly the same. It’s an odd time-warp where some things have evolved, and yes, life carried right on without you there, but in most ways it has essentially remained the same.''The strange thing is not home, it’s you.\xa0You have fundamentally changed. Your perspective has expanded. You’ve seen what else the world has to offer, and it simultaneously makes you more exciting to those who you’re returning to, and harder to relate to. It’s an unfortunate side effect that people will often say to me, “I couldn’t possibly have anything to say that’s as exciting as your stories!”, which is the worst thing ever, because honestly, how do I respond to that?''It generally takes me a few weeks to feel at home again. I feel like a stranger in a strange land. People talk about TV shows and movies I haven’t seen, reference commercials I know nothing about, and use buzzwords with meanings I’m oblivious to. I start to remember the things that encouraged me to leave in the first place. Then, I spend time with my closest friends and family and by the time the short visit is over, I find it incredibly bittersweet to be leaving. \xa0Here’s why:''All the Food''I realized that most of my conversations now turn into something about food. When I’m talking to people about visiting various places, I almost always ask about the food, or if they’ve''tried a certain dish I love''. That affection comes home with me to all of the foods I have been missing. \xa0My mom knows that the first thing I have to do after exiting the airport is to get Mexican food. I refuse to eat it abroad, it’s just too good and authentic at home, so I wait all year to have it again.''I don’t like cheese but am obsessed with Cheez Its. I know, American cuisine at its finest. I just love salty, crunchy, fake cheesiness. \xa0Yes, it is a running joke amongst just about everyone who knows how deep the love goes.''Most people also question if they can trust me, and wonder what must be fundamentally wrong with me, upon learning that I do not love cheese. Not even a little bit. Not at all.''My Ridiculous Family''I have the kind of family who alternates between having deep conversations and trying to come up with as many puns as possible once we settle on a theme. They’re the kind of people who don’t even raise an eyebrow if I play music and dance as ridiculously\xa0as possible around the house. Chances are good one of them will even join me. Our neighbors, if they’re paying any attention, must be wondering what we’re high on (life man, the answer is life).''We occupy ourselves by writing new''Cards Against Humanity''cards in the game expansion packs, or by writing''humorous Amazon reviews''about banana slicers.''It’s just too big''Those crippling feelings of inadequacy''I realize how special that is and value my limited time with them and our commitment to keeping each other silly.''Friends''I have the kind of friends who very openly tell each other how proud we are of each other’s accomplishments and how much we mean to each other. I feel lucky because I’m surrounded by uplifting\xa0power women who don’t compete with each other, but rather draw inspiration from each other.''That kind of support and love is something I realize every day I’m lucky to have. The fact that they take time off from work and out of their incredibly busy schedules to hang out with me and plan trips together during the rare times I’m back in the States is touching (and I even get to go to''Burning Man''with a few of them!). \xa0I’m so touched by their constant love, support, and understanding that I’m far away and\xa0pursuing my dreams.''Ollie''Meet Ollie, the Taiwanese golden retriever. I have about 3 pet names for Ollie (which is short for Olifur – we think we’re so clever). I baby talk to him and make up songs with his name in them when I’m doing things around the kitchen, which he so attentively follows me around because he knows how clumsy and likely to drop food I am.''I often wonder to myself if perhaps I’m just a little bit off my rocker talking to a dog as if at some point he just might respond. He is an incredibly attentive listener, though.''California''I live in what I, quite arrogantly I might add, consider to be the best and most beautiful state in the union. Coming home is a reminder of what I’m missing abroad. When sitting in land-locked Berlin this summer, I definitely did miss the hot and dry heat of the desert, the days we used to take boats out on the Pacific Ocean back when I lived in Newport Beach, and watching the dolphins from my living room during my university days in Santa Barbara.''I never took where I grew up for granted, and always valued the amazing beauty surrounding me.

Stick with me, though, and you’ll see that this is, and simultaneously isn’t, about Burning Man at all.''If you’re a subscriber to my newsletter (see that signup form on the right?!) and/or follow me on social media (see those icons above the cover photo?!), you already know that I just attended the Burning Man festival, which finished two weeks ago. The dust is finally off of my clothes, my hair is completely back to normal, and the crowd surfing wounds on my legs are almost healed (but they will leave a scar).''Though it’s incredibly hard to explain, Burning Man is an arts festival in the desert in Nevada\xa0where a city of over 70,000 people is erected basically overnight. The main components are radical self-reliance and radical self-expression. This means nothing is provided and attendees must bring all of their own food, shelter, water (showers inclusive), and no money can be used, so nothing can be bought nor sold, and nothing can be thrown away.''You can find whatever you want there, even if that means doing nothing but participating in orgies, taking yoga and meditation classes, or dancing your face off to music. That’s really the best way to describe it, and apart from attending, you’ll never really understand what it is.''The sunset at Burning Man Saturday night''This year was my third consecutive burn (meaning I’ve been three times). I come home around this time each year specifically because I want, I''need'', to attend this festival. Those of us who are regulars refer to it as returning''home''. Which, for me, has a double meaning since it’s also when I return home to the US each year.''Most other travel bloggers who attend write several articles about the festival, yet apart from that first article after my first year, shortly after the birth of this blog, I haven’t shared photos, haven’t written a word, and have stayed mostly silent.''Why?''I need to keep it to myself''When I looked through my photos this year I laughed. Each one of the 10 or so snaps was of a sunset. I had no photos of the art, and I had almost none of myself or my friends. I spend hours upon hours hand making all of my costumes. Trust me, they’re impressive. How many photos do I have wearing any? One, it was candidly taken, and you can’t even really see my outfit.''Taken by a man named Thomas at a dance party called Pink Mammoth''There is mind-blowing art at Burning Man. There are things that seem like they couldn’t possibly be real. (Take a look at''Trey Radcliffe''‘s photos for a good idea of the kinds of things that can be seen during this week-long festival.)''Why don’t I walk around taking pictures considering that’s a''huge part of my travel-style''and a''big focus of this blog''? It’s simple: I don’t want to.''Burning Man is my week that I follow every whim, do whatever the heck I want in that moment, and completely forget the outside world – especially work.''Do you have a special place or time like that?''Another sunset? How surprising''I also tend to suffer from''post-playa depression''after Burning Man. Last year it was severe. This year I’ve managed it a bit better. I tend to be unable to read articles about it without feeling like crying just a little bit. I can’t look at photos, and I can’t think about the fact that it’s another 12 months away. I also had intense FOMO (fear of missing out) last year, worried that I hadn’t maximized my time.''This year, I finally accepted that in a city of 70k, where nearly everyone is contributing in some incredible way, it’s impossible to see even 1/50th of all that there is to see. Each year, it’s exactly what I make it, and exactly what I need it to be. That’s why I keep going back – I know the experience will be different every time.''Aren’t most destinations that way, after all?''The man burning (I can’t even take credit for this. My friend, Chief, took the camera and snapped this one. Thanks for doing that, man)''I want it to stay pure''After my first year, when traveling I’d tell everyone about how amazing I thought Burning Man is. I talked about it constantly. Then, tickets sold out in 2013 in 45 minutes. \xa0Millionaires and billionaires started building VIP camps. Celebrities started tweeting about it. Suddenly I felt protective. The whole point is that the city is inclusive, not exclusive. It isn’t and never has been an event where anyone is more important than anyone else. It has to stay that way.''After myself and a few other bloggers wrote about''Sak Yant tattoos'', I heard through the grapevine that Wat Bang Phra has seen an influx of foreign visitors, many of whom are not respectful of the customs. They’re even thinking of moving locations to combat the problem. I’ve also seen''Pai''gradually become more and more built up. This past visit, I saw a resort being built. It made my heart ache.''Of course I’m not so arrogant that I think I singlehandedly did any of this, but the wat and Pai are small places. Even an increase of a few hundred or thousand will make an impact. If we all keep talking about the good and never the bad, things start to get ruined (think Koh Phi Phi after the fame of''The Beach'') by visitors who just want to make these places another party.''In closing, in a way, Burning Man is like my sunset pictures. What I wanted it to be. Just like a sunset, you can’t talk about it and expect others to understand the magnitude of how it looked or made you feel in the moment. We’ve all seen them, and we all have our favorite.''I want to keep it that way in my heart, so I try not to relive it online over and over. Despite what I know could be a lot of clicks and a lot of traffic to my blog by writing about this place, it’s one of the destinations on my secret list that will remain that way.''What else is on there?

Once he died, all of it went to waste, no longer mattered, and seemed to have been for nothing. It was Jason’s wake-up call. He stopped chasing money and instead chased peace. He found it on Bottle Beach, so he stayed.''I’m no Jason, but I departed a “normal” life in a similar fashion, chasing peace and trying form my own opinions on how I should live. I still don’t have the answers, but maybe that’s because life is really about the questions.''Just about every writer who travels long term eventually puts out a post about things they’ve learned, but for me, there are many more questions than answers.''As much as I’ve traveled outwardly, these past two years have gone inward quite a bit as well, turning my perceptions upside down and challenging everything I thought I knew. Here\xa0are 10 key questions I realized we need to ask more, determined\xa0from traveling alone for the past two years:''1)\xa0Why don’t I realize how rich I am?''Having a roof, real walls, regular meals, clean water, the technology to read this blog, a car (no matter how much of a clunker it is), access to a credit card (or even a bank account), and the ability to obtain a passport that permits entry\xa0into most countries in this world is a massive luxury that most people do not have.''It’s easy to get\xa0bombarded by rich celebrity worship, to obsess over how to be thin or look pretty, to feel inadequate because the guy who just passed you on the freeway drives a Maserati, or to give too much importance to a Louis Vuitton purse. Every day we’re convinced that who we are and what we have isn’t good enough.''Leaving the Western world and going to places where scores of people live in shacks with dirty water, have no hope of ever leaving their small towns, and do the same back-breaking tasks every day with very little chance of ever knowing what it’s like to worry about gaining weight put this into real perspective. Even the poorest of my circle friends (which is actually probably''me''now) is rich beyond imagination compared to the majority of the people in the world.''2) Why aren’t\xa0generosity, openness, and compassion valued more than money and beauty?''I used to think that the most important things a person could possess were money, good looks, and power. Now I realize that so many of those things are fake, fleeting, and so irrelevant and shallow that I shudder at my former definition of success.''The person who selflessly helps another, seeking no recognition or even thanks, the person who manages to smile and be kind most of the time, and the person who doesn’t turn up his nose at a new custom, but remains open – he’s the one who I admire and want to spend my time with whether he has money or not.''3) Why do I always think it’s about me?''It’s easy to get frustrated or feel agitated when traveling in a new country where I feel like an outsider because I don’t understand much of anything and can’t comprehend the customs. It’s even easier to get upset when I feel I’ve been cheated or a tout is too aggressive with me. I feel targeted, but that’s silly, because it’s really not about me.''People simply want to pursue happiness instead of suffering. Maybe that means cheating me or waving me away if helping me might be too much of a hassle. Taking it personally is the wrong approach. I do believe that you get out what you put out there, but I also believe that how random people treat me is usually not about me.''You never know what the full story is''4)\xa0Why do I forget that happiness is a choice?''“I’m captain of this ship,” I often have to tell myself on down days. If I’m going to be sad, it’s because I’m letting myself follow negative thought loops. If I’m going to be at peace, it’s because I’ve mentally put myself there.''It’s important to be careful where one puts his or her energy, because so much of what we subconsciously think or believe shapes our day-to-day lives in ways that we often can’t see until it’s too late.''I thought traveling would cure all, but nothing can, because there are positives and negatives that come along with every choice. Once I realized this and simply pushed out negative thoughts and refused to think of them, life became a lot sweeter.''5)\xa0Can less really be more?''Ever since de-complicating my life and possessing\xa0fewer things, I’ve realized how much easier it has been to enjoy every moment.''I make''about 20% of the income''I used to as an investment banker. It’s miniscule. It means I have to eat street food, stay in cheap countries, and take public transport to make ends meet. It also means I experience more local culture, eat better, and love and laugh more in my daily life''6) Can love really last\xa0forever?''A friend once said to me that all relationships ebb and flow, and I realized how right he was once I started traveling, leaving some of my best friends and could-have-been romantic partners behind. Yet the best friends who have always been there for me from back home still are, and though our friendship has evolved over time, the fact that we continue to put effort in is what makes us close.''The natural state of things is to change. It’s OK if a relationship changes because that’s what life and people do. Accepting this has made life less stressful and put less pressure on my relationships.''What’s real?''7)\xa0How much of perception is real?''Photoshopped images, only the happy moments that show up on Facebook, and the acquaintances\xa0who seem to be hitting every major milestone of the magic three: a master’s degree, marriage, and motherhood, can make me feel like an utter failure at times.''But there’s often so much behind the scenes that gets swept under the rug. Everyone has skeletons in her closet that she hides, no matter how issue-free things appear on the surface. Comparing myself to something that isn’t even real is a recipe for disaster. As Theodor Roosevelt said, “comparison is the thief of joy.”''8)\xa0Why don’t I appreciate what I have achieved more?''When I was a kid, I envisioned myself going to the exact university I ended up attending. When I was a teenager, I imagined living in Newport Beach one day and climbing the corporate ladder – something I did exactly six years later. Then, I dreamed of buying a one-way ticket and traveling the world, building a travel blog and having real readership. It has all happened, and yet I still find ways to be dissatisfied with the present moment, always wanting more. More of''what'', though?''Now I realize, it’s not about, “once I do this, I’ll be happy” (point #4). It’s more about recognizing the triumphs and having pride in my accomplishments while still dreaming and acknowledging that I have and always will have future goals. When I stop and appreciate that I’ve done much of what I’ve set out to do, I feel a lot better about what I haven’t yet achieved.''9)\xa0Why am I so afraid of getting older?''Mark Twain said, “Do not complain about getting old, it is a privilege denied to many.”''I can’t help it, I was raised in Southern California and it’s a shallow, Hollywood-impacted culture. We care a lot about our looks and how others perceive us. It has taken a long time for me to finally realize my body is a vessel, and it’s the soul that makes me''me''. This may seem overly flowery but appreciating my health, amazing life experiences, and most importantly, freedom, are important and only afforded to me because I have survived for as long as I have.''When I think about all of the things I’ve experienced in my life, I realize that each year is the greatest gift I could ever have been blessed with. Not everyone makes it out of infancy, childhood, or their early 20s.''10)\xa0Why do I think everything I do matters so darn much?''I stared up at the stars one night on''a boat in Komodo''and couldn’t believe how small it made me feel. It was like I couldn’t matter less in this universe. I’m just one small hiccup in millions of years in an endless abyss of particles, ideas, and energy. It was incredibly freeing to realize this. It was like any little mistake I make will never matter, and nobody really cares anyways.''Once I realized how little time anyone else devoted to thinking about me as compared to the amount of time I''thought''people spent judging me, I realized I was free. I can do anything I want, because every little thing I do, as long as it doesn’t hurt someone else, has almost no impact in the long-term. A few centuries from now, it’ll be as if I didn’t even exist.''This isn’t depressing. Quite the opposite – it’s liberating! The small stuff is not a big deal, and little mistakes are meant to be made.''In closing, there are a lot of things I learned from two years of traveling,\xa0becoming my own boss, and spending most of the year in places completely foreign to me. Chief among them is to never stop asking questions, wondering, and of course, wandering.''Join over 30,000 monthly readers!

So far, we’ve discussed''how to get started'',''how to handle social media'', and''how to network''and find your voice.''Now we’ve arrived at one of the most important steps of the process: finding your readers! I say finding your readers instead of letting them find you, because this is a pretty active part of the process and a big reason why lots of people have great content but a small audience. You can write the best travel blog on the planet, but if nobody knows about it, how will you be able to grow a readership?''The following are essential things to learn in order to grow your readership month-over-month.''Search Engine Optimization''Ideally, A big chunk of your traffic will come from search engines. \xa0Most readers find Be My Travel Muse by searching for various topics and often stick around or become regular readers.''Since you’ve''already installed WordPress SEO by Yoast'', this process will be a bit easier. Ideally, your blog name will already have a travel-related name without a lot of search competition which will help with Google rankings. \xa0Most importantly, however, your posts each need to be optimized. This means that the title, URL of the post, and keywords in the post itself and in the “focus keyword” box for the SEO widget will match.''Try to pick something that you would search for yourself and don’t make it too broad. For example, when I wrote about''hiking Mt. Bromo in Java without a tour'', I was targeting a very specific set of keywords, which has helped it come up close to first on Google. That post gets lots of search traffic from people looking for that exact set of information.''SEO is something you should never stop learning about. It is ever-changing and like it or not, Google is the main player in this category and what you really need to do is optimize to their constantly evolving algorithms. A myriad of companies out there focus on just SEO and charge a boat load of money for their consulting services. By learning about it yourself, you can essentially handle it in-house.''I’m always reading books on the subject, increasing my knowledge of SEO and writing in general. I’d highly recommend reading the following books for your blogging journey:''SEO Fitness Workbook: The Seven Steps to Search Engine Optimization Success on Google''by Jason McDonald''Ultimate Guide to Link Building: How to Build Backlinks, Authority and Credibility for Your Website, and Increase Click Traffic and Search Ranking (Ultimate Series)''By Garret Ward and Eric French''As with social media, don’t assume you know it all, and never stop learning.''Guest Blogging''Link building is also a highly important part of SEO. It helps Google to determine the trustworthiness of your site. The more high-quality websites point to your blog, the more Google decides to push you higher in the rankings.''In order to gain links, I recommend guest blogging. I blogged for other\xa0travel blogs\xa0constantly\xa0in the beginning of my blogging journey. As I freelance more, I have less time for guest blogs, but this was an essential part of my initial growth strategy for\xa0finding readers.''There are lots of blogs that accept guest posts, and lots that don’t (I, for example, do not because my blog is about my story). Take a look at your favorite blogs and see if they have guest posts. If so, maybe they’d want a post from you! \xa0Send a pitch to the owner of the blog and see if s/he likes your idea. \xa0Go for blogs that have a higher readership than yours, and be sure to check out''Google Pagerank checker'', which measures the trustworthiness of a site,\xa0to make sure their page rank is higher than yours (the lowest is 1 with most travel blogs falling between 1 and 4).''The following blogs accept guest posts and are a great place to get started:''Her Packing List''Where Sidewalks End''(especially interviews)''Holiday Nomad''Write travel tips for''Travel Dudes''and many, many more.''Connecting With Your Audience''Your audience is everything. They’re the ones who will share your stories, follow your advice, and help you to grow. I invest a lot of time in replying to emails, comments, and meeting up with readers abroad. \xa0Even though none of these things directly translates to cash in my pocket, I know that appreciating and responding to readers is the key to developing a following.''As seen by some email excerpts in the first post of this series, I have amazing readers who take time out of their days to read what I say and who often email me about their hopes and dreams. I can’t emphasize enough how much this all means to me and how important it is for you as a blogger. By always responding kindly and appreciating the time that they put in, you’ll help to cultivate these important relationships.''I’ve mentioned a Dave Kerpen book earlier in this series and am mentioning another one of his books now. Read''Likeable Business: Why Today’s Consumers Demand More and How Leaders Can Deliver''.''Though this one is more business-focused and partially has to do with handling employees, it also has tons of invaluable information on how to best serve your\xa0customers, which are your readers. Dave’s books are highly worthwhile and if you only buy one book to start with, make it one of his.''In the next and final installment of this series we’ll discuss how to make money with your blog.

He didn’t care if I didn’t buy anything (though I later did, for about 1/3 the asking price on the tourist street).''I’m also glad I continued to venture down that alleyway to the place where locals played guitar and made water buffalo mo mos (dumplings) for 60 cents.

On the surface, it seems like the ideal job and in many ways it is, but it is absolutely a job that requires strategy, an entrepreneurial spirit, particular skill in the areas of storytelling and visual presentation, and approaching it as a business.''In this video, I talk about the top 10 things that you can do to stand out from the thousands of other people who are also starting a travel blog. Below I have all of the links and resources for each point in the video. These are the things that I have personally used to build my blog into a six-figure business that has been fully sustaining me for the past three years.''Ready to put in the hard work? Here we go:''1. Build a niche''Solo female and adventurous travel are my passion. What’s yours?''What do you love so much that you consume it all the time and obsess about it? That is the thing that can set you apart. Even if it seems like what you love is super obscure, remember that there are billions of people with Internet access in the world and all you really need are 1000 true fans and you’re golden.''These resources can help you figure out what your niche should be and why it’s important:''How to Turn Casual Readers into Raving Fans''by Pat Flynn''1000 True Fans''by Kevin Kelly''2. Write for anyone who will let you''Don’t be afraid to put in the hard work!''The most successful strategy I employed to grow was writing for other sites. I got exposure to their audiences and it also helps with valuable SEO back links. My''column on nomadicmatt.com''has been instrumental to my growth, and writing for others can do the same for you.''In the video, I talk about how to pitch and who to approach but also keep in mind the following:''If you want to know if someone has more traffic than you do, check out''similarweb.com.''To see what Google thinks of them, use''Open Site Explorer''. The domain authority will help you to see what it’s worth for you to get a back link from them. Don’t be fooled by huge social media numbers because they might not tell the whole story.''This list''is a good place to start to find blogs that accept guest posts.''3. Be helpful''When you sit down to write, think about how what you are putting out there is going to be beneficial to someone else. In the beginning, I didn’t have this in mind and I wrote more like a diary with my story. While I think some people found it entertaining, once I switched to an approach that was more helpful, things grew a lot more quickly for me.''I think it’s still very important to humanize your brand and to be relatable, and that is a fine balance between being personal and presenting facts.''Keep in mind that just by being you and by being vulnerable, you can be incredibly helpful. Here are some great examples:''Vulnerable, funny, and personal:''The Bloggess''The Power of Vulnerability''by\xa0Brené Brown''Factual:''The Points Guy''My end all, be all post on the cost to travel the world''4. Why are you doing it?''Always ask why''I was recently talking with a friend about growing his business online and I asked him, so why are you doing this? He was quick to answer that it was because he enjoyed it. That is definitely step one but it’s not the whole story.''Being able to articulate the reasons why the world needs what you’re putting out there is important. If you have a very clear why then you will be able to figure out the how. Here are some must-sees and reads to figure this out:''Simon Sinek’s''TED talk''And his books''Start with Why''and''Find Your Why''5. Don’t be afraid to spend money''TAKE MY MONEY!''I took a university class taught by a very rich, entrepreneur-turned-college professor who would often say, “The poor man spends more money on suits than the rich man.”''He meant that by springing for quality in the first place, you spend a lot less on replacing things that stop working because it was a cheap fix to begin with.''Many people who get into blogging are excited about it because of the low cost of doing business. They figure that it will be as easy as setting up a site and writing some posts and watching the money roll in. They will fail and you will succeed if you approach it differently.''By spending a few hundred dollars on a course that will save you months of trial and error, and by getting better camera gear, you will be leagues ahead of almost everyone else trying to get in at the same time. That’s why you’re reading this in the first place, right?''I highly recommend''Nomadic Matt’s Superstar blogging course''(not just because we’re buddies, but because it’s legit).''Here’s my full review of the course.''This is a''guide to my camera gear'', but if that’s a bit on the high end for you, I think that''this camera''is a fantastic alternative that delivers insane quality for the price.''6. Hire People''Team work makes the dream work!''I understand that your blog is your baby and it is very hard to give up any kind of control. However the more I have hired people to help the more time I have to focus on the creative aspects of this blog.''For example, I really don’t need to learn the tech stuff because it would take me forever and I can hire someone to help with that. The same goes for graphic design. Surely there are things that you just don’t want to do that someone else could do better and quicker. If you possibly can, devote some resources to that.''I’ve asked for recommendations in the blogger Facebook groups for this (like the''business of blogging'', or the superstar blogging Facebook group) and my full-time assistant is a reader who reached out, asked if she could intern, and who has been with me for years in various roles. So when it’s time to hire someone, ask your readers!''7. Pick one or two things and master them''If you focus on just one thing you will do very well at that one thing but if you spread yourself too thin then nothing will get enough attention.''So where should you spend your time? Personally I would highly recommend SEO. Social media is important for me, but nothing compares to Google as far as my traffic sources. I almost don’t want to share these tools that I use, because they’re that helpful, but since this is here to help I’m telling all:''Swiss Made Marketing'', makes SEO a piece of cake. For the amount of value it delivers, I would pay triple for it.''Essentialism''by Greg McKeown''8. As soon as possible, stop paying attention to your competition''Focus on yourself''Most bloggers spend all day on Facebook and other social media platforms. They are designed to be addictive and they work! A year ago I deleted the Facebook app from my phone and it was the BEST IDEA EVER. Gone are the days of opening up my phone when I have one moment of downtime that expands to five or 10 minutes or even a half hour of scrolling through the news feed before even realizing it.''If you can break your social media addiction and stop paying attention to what everyone else is doing, you’re going to be so far ahead of the other game you’re going to leave them in the dust because you’re going to create so much extra time for yourself. Additionally, the comparison game can be deadly to your self-esteem and your ability to create amazing things. I know this all too well. These reads are excellent for helping you ignore the rest:''How to stand out Among 2.6 Billion Photographers''by Marius ‘Vice’ Vieth''Four Hour Workweek''by Tim Ferriss''9. Don’t play games''It can be tempting to fake it, but when you do that, you’re not connecting with real people.''One new method is to join comment pods on Instagram where everyone agrees to like and comment on everyone else’s photo in the group. This helps everyone appear to be popular and get more paid work, based on lies. Trust me when I say, eventually these tactics will stop working.''It is really obvious to me when people are in comment pods. And if it is obvious to me, it is obvious to PR as well. Eventually the media side catches up because they hire people who are in the know to consult them. If you are known in the industry for playing games then nobody will hire you. It will be your undoing.''When I first started blogging, there were a lot of black hat techniques that people were using and most of those people are not around anymore or are not doing very well these days. If you have a real audience, even if it is small, that is much better than a fake one that will not pay off in the long run.''Remember, having 1000 true fans is so much better than having 100,000 fake followers.''10. Never stop learning''Don’t ever get too comfortable''There are so many free and cheap resources out there that can help you keep learning and doing well at this business. Here are a few that continuously help me:''The Smart Passive Income podcast''Entrepreneur on Fire podcast''Tools of Titans''by Tim Ferriss''Likeable Social Media''by Dave Kerpin''I realize that this is all a lot of reading, study, and time that I’m suggesting you spend on building this foundation, but this is the formula that worked for me and that worked for the entrepreneurs referenced in this post, all of whom are at the top of their game.''I fully believe that by using all of these tactics, you can reach success in your own unique way that will help you to stand the test of time and build a real business. It will take a crazy amount of work, but if you love it then you’ll do it with pleasure, working through the times that are lean and difficult and overcoming each obstacle with your eye on the prize: A lifestyle and job that allow you ultimate freedom.''Pin me!''I hope this post helped you if you’re new to blogging, or even if you have been around for a while.

In the end, it led me to where I am now, so I’m ok with how it all went, but I have still not stopped dreaming of a return to Taipei.''It was there that I fell in love with Asia, embarked on the craziest journey of my life by far by obtaining a weirdly semi-famous status there (I still have the tabloids I was in!), and eventually returning home to normalcy.

It’s not that I think I’ve singlehandedly made it more touristic, it’s just that I want more than anything for it to remain just the way it is: beautiful, peaceful, and wild.''Chengdu, China''I didn’t expect to like Chengdu nearly as much as I did. I just wanted to pass through and get my visa extended, then move back over to the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture – an''area I’m truly, madly in love with''. What ended up happening was an almost month-long stint spent there meeting the expat community and becoming fully immersed in it.''By the time I left, I was already plotting a plan to come back in six months and start teaching English.

I realized that in all that time, I’ve never given you guys a post on my favorite things to do there. It’s time I changed that.''Chiang Mai is awesome for all kinds of reasons, including its natural beauty, amazing street food, cheap prices, and plentiful night markets. It’s no surprise that so many digital nomads call it home, and most travelers going to Thailand add it to their itineraries. The following are my nine (yes, nine, not ten, but nine) favorite things to do there:''9) Temples''A holiday at Wat Chedi Luang''Chiang Mai has over 300 Buddhist temples (''wats''), so there is no shortage of temples to check out in and around the city. That said, plenty of people can get “templed out,” so I suggest checking out two of the more famous and magnificent ones – Doi Sutep and Wat Chedi Luang. Doi Sutep is located about 30 minutes outside of the old town, but can be accessed by songthaew for around 50 baht per person. It has a cable car which grants access to a vista of the whole city. Wat Chedi Luang is located in the old city, right in the middle.''(by the way, these are my favorite''hotels''and''hostels''in Chiang Mai)''8) Sunday Night Market''The Sunday night market can, as the name suggests, only be attended once per week. So, if you’re passing through Chiang Mai, try to make it on a Sunday. The market is full of delicious food, clothing, jewelry, art, sunglasses, you name it. It runs right down the center of the old city from Thapae gate.''Now that I’ve experienced it multiple times, I actually tend to enjoy walking on the streets parallel to the main one the market takes place on. They tend to have some funkier clothing options and are less crowded.''7) Massages Galore''Can we talk about how amazing massages are for a moment? Being massaged with oils for hours for only a few dollars? Yes please, sign me right up.''Most massages in Chiang Mai take place in a nice air conditioned room (a luxury in the Chiang Mai heat!) and can be found for as low as 120 baht per hour (about $4!). I usually go for two hours – an hour for feet and legs and an additional hour for head and shoulders. Tips are always appreciated.''6) Motorbike''If you’re confident on a motorbike, the mountains surrounding Chiang Mai are some of the most beautiful in all of Thailand. Full of waterfalls and monasteries, I was truly blown away by the natural beauty.''5) Ladyboy Cabaret''I attended a ladyboy cabaret in Phuket (where I accidentally made it to second base with one of them, but''that’s another story''), and wasn’t that impressed with the dancing and the price tag. Then I heard that the one in Chiang Mai is really good, with phenomenal dancing, and free.''Yes, free!''Head to the night bazaar and catch the show at 9pm. All you have to do is buy a drink to gain admission. Be forewarned that if you’re sitting in the front few rows you’re likely to get a lap dance or even get pulled up on stage.''4) Festivals''Yi Peng''Chiang Mai is an awesome city to be in for both Yi Peng and Songkran. Both Buddhist holidays are big all over Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and beyond, but Chiang Mai is really where it’s at as far as having a great time and being part of a huge celebration. Yi Peng is characterized by''a big lantern release''and Songkran is basically a giant water fight.''I regret that I was on a''SCUBA dive''boat (well not the diving, but the timing) for the whole of the only Songkran I’ve experienced in Thailand. I aim to rectify that this coming year.''3) Cooking Classes''I kept putting off taking a cooking course, feeling that I’d be able to follow a recipe book myself if I ever felt like making Thai food at home. I was missing the point, though. There’s technique that was very helpful to learn in the class, not to mention it was tons of fun and really delicious. Considering it cost us 1000 baht per person (about $30), and we made 5 meals plus a curry, I’d say it was definitely worth it.''I went with Basil Cookery school which was pretty healthy and very well-run.''Call them''to make an appointment.''2) Elephant Play''Playing with elephants''I was sad to learn that elephants are tortured into submission during their youth and many lead very sad existences toting tourists around on their backs. I vowed never to ride one, but felt that something was missing from my Thailand experience.''Then, I discovered Elephant Nature Park which rescues elephants from tourism and logging and gives them a new lease on life. Elephants here are free to roam, and visitors can feed and bathe them.''Check out this post''for the full writeup on why this is my second favorite activity in Chaing Mai.''1)\xa0Eat Everything''A friend of mine asked me to come up with a one-word description for every place I’d been in Thailand. We simultaneously said, “food” for\xa0Chiang Mai. Before I started traveling, I just didn’t care that much about food. Sure, I needed it to survive, but it wasn’t''that''exciting.''Then I started traveling and became a full-blown foodie. The first question I ask people when they talk about where they’ve traveled to is whether they ate a certain dish there. When I think about home, other than my loved ones, what I really miss is the Mexican food. I’m already salivating over the thought of returning to Vietnam, and I can’t wait to step outside my flat in Berlin later for some potato salad.''The street food in Chiang Mai is delicious and plentiful. It tends to be fresh and super cheap. If that scares you a bit and you’d rather do restaurants, I go with a few main rules: no tablecloths (that comes from my friend''James''), the restaurant should ideally be full of locals, extra points if the menu is not in English, and you get a gold star if the tables are on the street.''What NOT to Do:''While I’m not one to push my opinions on anyone, I’d just like to make it clear that riding elephants, or going to Tiger Kingdom (where the tigers are drugged, not fed properly, and are kept in tiny cages), are two things I strongly caution against. As tourists, we vote with our dollars. Think twice before participating in animal tourism.''In closing, Chiang Mai is so full of great things to do, it’s almost impossible to be bored there.''Have you been?

That was after I completed my first 12 months of continuous solo travel, and I have since completed another 10.''I still get a lot of emails asking how I afford it, which led me to the realization that I wasn’t clear enough before – even to myself. There were a lot of things I didn’t consider – mainly about how''my approach to spending is fundamentally different now than it used to be''.''I also didn’t fully\xa0cover how I make money from my blog, so I’m releasing a 5-part series on exactly how I built and started making money from this blog in the coming weeks as well.''Returning to the question at hand:''how have I really managed to afford to keep traveling without working a full time job?''For the past few months I’ve kept meticulous records of what I’ve been earning and what I’ve been spending so that I can figure out what exactly has\xa0made\xa0it possible for me to survive earning about 10-20% (dependent on the month) of what I did when I worked full time.''Wow. Look at that figure again.''My yearly income is\xa010% of what I used to make!''How am I even surviving right now?''After crunching the numbers and really closely monitoring what I’ve been spending on, I realized something. The real question is,''What in the world did I spend on before?''Breaking it down:''I had $25,000 in debt to pay off after school. My tuition was paid for, but I had things like rent, books, and food\xa0that needed to be covered as well. \xa0When I was making a large salary, I also paid about half of my income, since I had no write-offs, in some form of taxes, medicare, or social security, none of which were directly benefitting me.''I still had to save for my own retirement because social security alone isn’t enough and I covered a lot of my own medical costs as we don’t have socialized medicine in the US and medicare\xa0is only for those over 67 years old.''What was left over usually went towards living expenses. I wasn’t a big spender by Orange County, California standards, but by my current standards, I sure was. \xa0I bought new clothes and shoes all the time. I always bargain hunted, getting nearly everything on sale, but that doesn’t change the fact that it was designer labels I wore. I still spent $25-100 on a shirt and thought I had done well.''I also went to every music festival I felt like attending, frequented Las Vegas (where I never had to pay for anything past hotels and flights due to friends and promoter connections I had there, but still), and every now and then, spent on a big-ticket item like Pilates certification, a $700 purse, or a $2000 vacation. \xa0It didn’t matter because each month I made enough to pay off my credit card back to zero without noticing a dip in my bank account.''I’d spend $2000 in one week while vacationing and''now it takes me nearly two months''to spend that.''I also tended to invest a lot, that’s not something I’m doing now and truthfully that is worrying. My goal over the next 6 months is to get to a point where I’m covering my expenses, saving a bit in cash, and investing a bit as well. If I can’t make this happen, I have to seriously consider other options.''What I was spending then:''Health and wellness: Around $150 per month on Pilates, yoga, spin, and gym memberships and $65 per month on facials''Phone: $75/month on my cell phone plan (and I was grandfathered in at a low rate for being a customer for so long while most of my friends paid more like $100)''Connectivity: $150/month on cable TV and internet''Sleeping: $700 on rent and utilities (incredibly cheap for my area plus I was sharing a room – this helped tremendously)''Transport: $200/month on gas and car insurance''Shopping: easily $700/month if not more''Food: An average of $3-$10 per meal. \xa0Food was not a big expense as pre made and processed foods are expensive and I bought raw ingredients and cooked most of what I ate. If I ate food out it was usually pretty affordable.''(By the way, here are\xa0some tips on how to cut this down and''save money for traveling'')''What I Spend Now:''Health and wellness: I’m spending the summer in Berlin where I bought a bicycle at the flea market for 50 Euros and ride it everywhere, even an hour away. I use online pilates videos combined with my training knowledge to work out at home without needing gym equipment. I miss the class atmosphere but I can do without. I miss facials and once I’m making more money that will be a treat I give myself.''Phone: Usually around $15 maximum/month (In Vietnam it was only $4)''Connectivity: I don’t watch TV anymore, and I don’t miss it. Internet is covered by the hostels I stay at''Sleeping: I usually\xa0stay at places that range from $5-$10 per night. I like hostels because that’s how I meet people as a solo traveler. I don’t mind if it’s less comfortable than a fancy hotel room. It really doesn’t bother me, which is helpful.''Transport: varies quite a bit but hardly ever exceeds $100-200/month unless I take flights (which blow the whole budget immediately)''Shopping:\xa0An average of\xa0$50/month on replacing cheap clothing and shoes or buying warmer items if needed''Food: An average of $1-$10 per meal. I eat street food (because it’s the same as what they serve in the restaurants in Vietnam and Thailand! Really!), cheap food in Berlin, or cook at home''In Conclusion:''When I look at the comparisons, I’ve largely simplified my life and made it cheaper by living in cheaper places, but also by making different choices. Honestly?\xa0My life is no less rich because I can no longer buy $100 tops.''It’s richer now''in my $5 dress.''I haven’t worn most of those costly clothing items in years, and honestly I wouldn’t have even if I lived at home and they were hanging in my walk-in closet. Now I buy clothes and I wear them each week, or perhaps every other week. They get used to death. When they get a hole I move on. If I get tired of them I move on. They’re cheap, it doesn’t matter.''I take the time to wander around a national park, or to read a book, to write, to sing, to dance. I didn’t do those things much before. It took up time I didn’t have. When I did have the time, I wanted to spend it spending the money I had worked so hard for. I had to make it worth it somehow.''A brilliant''article I recently read''alerted me as to why this was:''Big companies didn’t make their millions by earnestly promoting the virtues of their products, they made it by creating a culture of hundreds of millions of people [who] buy way more than they need and try to chase away dissatisfaction with money.''In conclusion, I can tell you to buy fewer coffees, attend fewer movies, go out to bars less, or stop going to the mall, but the real way to afford to traveling the world is to''change your perspective''.''Will buying a latte bring you closer to Vietnam? Will a new cocktail dress make you more attractive than the other 5 already in your closet? Probably not, but a cultured outlook will. Becoming a more interesting person because you’ve seen the world will. Instead of thinking of spending less as limiting yourself, think of each thing you don’t buy as making you richer.''That’s the ticket to the world.''Pin me!''—''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''How I Afford My Nomadic Lifestyle''How I Afford Perpetually Traveling the World''How to Get SIM Cards in Southeast Asia''One of the things that excited me the most about visiting Thailand was the prospect of interacting with elephants.

For the remainder of their lives, they are typically controlled with the same sort of stick, with a hook in the end. That’s not something I ever want to support.''This is why I was happy to see''wild elephants in Sri Lanka''on safari, but it still left me wishing there was some way I could get closer to them.''What I didn’t know is there is an ethical way to play with rehabilitated elephants – those that have been injured in the logging industry in neighboring Myanmar, badly treated in tourism, have been used for begging for money from tourists, or were left to fend for themselves after the logging industry ended in Thailand.''What might have become of them?''Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai is a wonderland for rehabilitated elephants. They have plenty of room to roam, wash, and enjoy. Each one has a dedicated, stick-free mahout who makes sure the elephant is happy and healthy.''Elephant love''They get a chance to really be elephants again – socializing, forming groups, and sometimes giving birth to babies.

They use positive reinforcement — food — to get the elephants to where they need to be, rather than hooks and sticks.

That means if it’s a selfie and I’m far away, I can see what I’m shooting.

I resisted for years because I didn’t want a heavy tripod along, but then I realized that it let me do so much more with my photography, so I opted for a light one.''Amazon sells one for around $24''that isn’t heavy at all.

It is so-named because it paints everything gold when the sun starts to dip below the horizon and creates an etherial look to photos.''You can’t always be everywhere during golden hour, but if there are certain places where you know it will make a big difference, try to be there at the right time.''If the clouds in the sky are not the exciting kind, or if it’s the middle of the day and everything is super bright, try to find ways to focus on things other than the bright or gloomy sky.

I was a little torn on this but did buy handicrafts from local women, bought plenty of provisions on the trek, and ate my meals at the teahouses rather than bringing in my own food. I figured this at least helped bring money into the area in some small way.''How physically fit do I need to be?''What level of fitness is required?''Trekking the Annapurna circuit can be made longer and more difficult or shorter and easier, depending on your timetable and interest level in the higher and steeper side treks.''If possible, doing some trekking and spending time in higher altitudes prior to beginning is quite beneficial.\xa0 Trying a trek for a few days prior to know what you’re capable of – how far you can go each day, what parts of the body hurt and might need more support, and how much weight you can handle carrying – can only help.''Most of all, the\xa0important thing to remember\xa0apart from being injury-free is to have a positive attitude and to honor one’s body.\xa0 Don’t push it to the point that you feel defeated or start saying things like “can’t” to yourself.\xa0 Your pace is good enough and it’s not a competition.''Tips: When you’re hungry, eat something, when you’re thirsty stop and drink water.\xa0 Never underestimate how much a 30-second to two-minute break can help.\xa0 If you need rest, take a brief one and then keep going.''What is accommodation like?''Manang – a trekking town in Nepal''The Annapurna circuit and base camp treks are teahouse treks, meaning that there are guesthouses along the way that provide basic accommodation to trekkers (the accommodation becoming more basic as altitude increases) for a very low rate – usually free or just 100 NRP (about $1 USD) per person – with the intention that the trekkers will eat all of their meals at the guesthouse they stay in.''The teahouses gain their money from the food they sell at slightly higher prices than found elsewhere in Nepal rather than from the room rates. \xa0Keep this in mind when haggling on rooms.''It did bother me a bit when I saw that people brought and cooked all of their own food, yet stayed in the teahouses. \xa0I believe it’s important to buy one’s food along the trail as it lightens the load and puts money in the hands of the local people.''Tip:\xa0Most teahouses operate on solar power for showers and at the higher elevations, will charge for hot water.

I was regretful of this almost from the beginning as a strap on my backpack broke before I even got on the bus to start the trek. \xa0It was the perfect size and fit but the quality was horrible. Throughout the two weeks I used the gear, most of it broke or fell apart in some way. \xa0The same was true for my trekking buddy who had bought her gear in Pokhara.''In the future I would definitely buy the same items but would go for the genuine ones as I’ve now learned that quality will far outlast the knock offs and are therefore cheaper in the long run:''A good backpack:''I went with a''Deuter Adventure 35L''in bright green.

The best idea is to get genuine hiking shoes at home and to break them in before arriving (I’d suggest trying them on rather than ordering online). \xa0It’s also a great idea to bring sandals to wear after trekking to give your feet a break from the hiking shoes''SteriPEN Water Purifier''and''Nalgene water bottle'':''It’s possible to buy bottled water along the trail but at almost $2 per bottle at the higher altitudes and a big polluter, it doesn’t make much sense. Though there are some clean drinking water stations, they aren’t frequent enough to keep you hydrated during the whole trek. The best bet is to clean the water on the trail. \xa0I used Aquatabs, available for around $2-$3 at grocery stores in Pokhara to treat the local water. However, you must wait at least 30 minutes between treating the water and drinking it, plus the taste isn’t great. A Steripen, however, cleans the water in 30 seconds. \xa0These need to be obtained at home beforehand''Sleeping bag:''Instead of using a sleeping bag, I asked the teahouses for extra blankets.

We luckily arrived early enough (around 12 noon) to get a space in a shared 3-bed room with ice on the walls from the cold.

I had read it takes anywhere from 16-21 days, but, at our pace and by eliminating 2-3 by bus at the end, we only took nine! We also added three awesome guys to our group whom we had run into a few times over the course of the circuit trek.''Day ten:''In order to see Poon Hill, we did the trek from Tatopani to''Ghorepani,''a steep gain of 1600 meters over 18km. \xa0There were very few flats, downhills (thankfully for my knees), and anything other than steep inclining stone steps.

Usually the vista is quite impressive, but we had a hazy day so not much was visible.''I would complain, but I’ve had unbelievably amazing weather during my travels and still got to see the same mountains from different views, so I sucked it up and kept going.''We then made our way to''Bamboo''via Tadopani to begin the ABC trek.''The other side of the mountain brought much greener, wetter, and quite different trekking than the circuit had. \xa0I kept cursing the steep downhill steps followed by equally steep steps up. The final climb down to Bamboo revealed a set my knees just didn’t want to handle anymore. The colorful string of expletives I let off when I encountered them was some of my best work. It’s a pity nobody was around to hear it, as my friends had already made it to the tea house 10 or so minutes earlier.''Butterflies even more colorful than this one were all over the trails!''So much greenery!''Day twelve:''We walked 12 km with a nearly 2000-meter gain to''Annapurna Base Camp''. Normally this would be completely ill advised due to the altitude gain, but we were already acclimated from Thorung La pass, a good 1200 meters higher, and therefore had no issues.''The biggest difference with this trek was the amount of rain encountered. On the circuit we didn’t get any, but come 11am or so on the base camp trail, rains pelted us on the trail and mists rolled in.''Base camp in the distance''Hopefully this will be clear in the morning!''Day thirteen:''Unlike the circuit, the base camp trek goes up and then back down the same path. \xa0We awoke in time for the sunrise, which cleared up and provided some truly beautiful views of the mountains.''Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo''The crew''Annapurna one''Annapurna one bathed in golden morning light''Peace, love, and Annapurna one''We then walked 17 km to back to''Chomrong,''descending over 2100 meters through rain, mud, and another steep set of downward stone steps.''Day fourteen:''This was the final day. \xa0We walked 12 km to just beyond''Kimche''where we caught a bus back to''Pokhara''. \xa0One can continue onwards another few hours or so to finish the trek, but we’d had about enough after 14 days!''As for costs, without a guide things become much cheaper and you’re much freer to set your own schedule.

I said I’d rather not be alone, so I wasn’t mad at him. \xa0At about that moment, a red sedan with a young couple inside pulled over to take us to XiChang. \xa0I hadn’t even planned on being in Sichuan province, and had rather blindly followed Ya Ting to Lugu Lake, so just about anywhere within the province was fine with me.''Luckily, the couple also had some English language ability and were able to help Wen Song and I communicate a little more easily, essentially filling Ya Ting’s role. \xa0Six hours later, we had arrived.''Ya Ting, Wen Song, and I at Lugu Lake''The adorable employee at the youth hostel that evening, incredibly excited that I could speak Chinese with her, sat down with me and showed me all of the places in Sichuan province she thought I should visit, then hosted me at the employee dinner that evening. \xa0I owe her many thanks, because I later visited all of the places she suggested, and all were beautiful.''The next morning I left Wen Song and made it to the outside of the freeway onramp bound for Chengdu, just outside of the toll booth. \xa0I stuck my thumb up under the hot sun, casually putting my arm back down when the occasional police car rode by.''This time it was a little nerve-wracking. \xa0This time I was going to be hitchhiking alone, and it would be the longest distance yet. \xa0I decided to be choosy with who I accepted a ride from.''Five minutes passed before anyone pulled over. \xa0I was so used to immediate offers when I was with Ya Ting that I started to feel a bit concerned. \xa0Then, one car slowed, I came running, and they changed their minds and drove off just as slowly and cautiously as they had come.''A few more minutes passed before several cars pulled over, but none were headed in my direction. \xa0Funny enough, every time one stopped, another would trust it was a good idea and also pull over. Then long stretches of time would go by when they all sped past me, deciding in unison to bypass the strange foreigner.''Eventually a sleek black sedan pulled over and a woman dressed in furs (in 80+ degree weather, mind you) rolled down the window and demanded 200 RMB (about double what a bus would cost) for the ride. I said I couldn’t pay. \xa0Her husband asked where I was from and said furiously, “you’re American but you can’t pay?!” I said I wanted to hitch hike but thanked them anyway and swiftly backed away and returned to my post.''After what seemed like an eternity, but was in reality only about 30 minutes, I finally got a ride in a nice white SUV with two men bound for Chengdu. \xa0For the first time, I felt a bit stressed because in the past, Ya Ting did the bulk of the talking and I relaxed. \xa0This time, I had to summon all of my language skills and try to be a good passenger, conversing as much as possible.''I worried that I wasn’t doing well enough, but they were satisfied, even buying me lunch along the way (it was a 6-hour ride, after all), and predictably refusing when I tried to offer them money for the meal.''They dropped me off at a coffee shop, central in Chengdu, where I entered then used the WiFi to find a hostel. \xa0Just two days prior I couldn’t have told you I would end up in Sichuan province, yet there I was, traveling the entire way there on the kindness of strangers.''Of course I’ve seen and been the beneficiary of random acts of kindness before, but openly asking for help and being given so much more than that moved me more than I could have imagined when I took that first ride, thrilled at the sport.''Hitchhiking is, in its purest definition, openly asking for help while fully expecting the majority of the responses to be rejection. \xa0I think this is why those who picked me up were particularly generous. \xa0They treated me as the highest esteemed guest at the party that was the road, in their China.

Sometimes I had the best food by just playing street food roulette, meaning I had no idea what I was ordering, but if there were lots of locals eating there, it was typically a good sign.''A favorite of mine was the street soup vendor in''Hoi An''who shouted, “Vietnam!” at me when I walked by, followed by the biggest smile and most gleeful laughter I’ve ever heard, so clearly I had to eat there!

This ups the cost quite a bit, especially since I was there during the holidays, which leads me to reason number two. \xa0The hostel I stayed at in Boracay was $20/night just for a dorm bed since I was a there on the days surrounding New Year’s Eve. \xa0My flights cost more due to this as well. \xa0I also found that, \xa0as a solo traveler, there were far fewer dorm options which led me to shouldering the cost of private rooms on my own everywhere but in Boracay.''Accommodation:''As mentioned above, there wasn’t a possibility of staying in dorm beds for just a few dollars as is common in other parts of Southeast Asia. \xa0Therefore, I spent closer to $10 or sometimes even $20 per night on accommodation, making it the most expensive place in Southeast Asia for finding a place to lay my head, following Java in Indonesia.''Transportation:''This is the killer part. The busses on the islands, jeepneys, and tricycles can all be fantastically cheap, but the ferries between islands tend to cost a bare minimum of $20 per trip. \xa0Moving around much at all in the Philippines is going to be costly as things are farther apart and harder to access than they seem.''One particularly painful expenditure was a $230 flight from Boracay to Coron following New Year’s (this wasn’t even factored into the total price/day).''Food and Drink:''Eating local food didn’t typically cost much. I was able to eat some street BBQ chicken with rice for around $1 in Jagna on Bohol while waiting for a ferry, making that my cheapest meal.''In places like Boracay, cheaper non-western food wasn’t as simple to find, but still available and delicious. \xa0Chicken Adobo (a sauce of vinegar and spices), Tapa (fried beef strips), and Bulalo (a soup made by cooking bones until the marrow becomes a broth and the beef becomes super tender) are my favorite local dishes.''Drinks are also not bad with a bottle of San Miguel, the local brew, running at $1-2.''Cheap vs. Expensive places in the Philippines:''Jagna in Bohol was the cheapest place I visited.

I haven’t had similar issues with SIM cards in Southeast Asia.''Overall, Sri Lanka can be a cheap place to visit, but the cost of activities can really drive up the price. \xa0Missing out on the UNESCO sites and safaris would have really been unfortunate. \xa0Consider this when planning your trip!''READ NEXT: A Full Guide to Planning Your Sri Lanka Trip''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''They had said it would be pretty.\xa0 They had said it would be a challenging climb.\xa0 They had said it held spiritual significance.''They didn’t say it would be the most amazing sunrise view in all of Sri Lanka, or perhaps all of Asia, or dare I say, the world.''Okay maybe not''the world''but it was definitely in my top 5.''I have a thing for climbing and hiking,''especially for a sunrise''.\xa0 It’s what my family always did together and there’s nothing like the view at the top of a strenuous hike to provide the perfect reward for all that hard work – not to mention you can totally have chocolate milk after.\xa0 I mean you’ve earned it,''amiright or amiright?''Adam’s peak (or Sri Prada) is so-named because it is believed that Adam’s footprint rests at the top, if you ask a Musilm or Christian, that is.\xa0 If you ask a Buddhist, it is most certainly the Buddha’s footprint and if you ask a Hindu, it belongs to Shiva.''The breathtaking view''Either way, it has become a significant pilgrimage place for several faiths, resulting in large numbers of locals making the 5,000-stair climb to the peak at 2,243 meters (7,359 feet) over 5 kilometers (3-ish miles) during the months of December to May along a well-lit path.''That’s a lot of stairs''I elected to go the week right before the pilgrimage season began, which ended up being the''best idea ever.''The pathways were not lit during this time, so I brought a headlamp along so as not to stumble and fall, which I am prone to do.''During the peak pilgrimage season, hundreds if not thousands of people flock to Adam’s peak each day for the sunrise, making it a crowded climb.\xa0 When I went, there were about 50 people at the top, which is probably the max that the peak can comfortably accommodate.''Hiking up with the stars, though, shutting off my headlamp every now and then and just sitting and admiring, not worrying about anyone else passing by and happily not missing out on the milky way that would be shut out by lighting, was perfect to me.''I had read various forums saying that it would be unsafe to try the climb during the off-season, or that it was closed.\xa0 I’m happy to report this is untrue and I’d urge anyone who wants to try it, as long as it’s not raining (because that would make it quite unpleasant and muddy), to give it a shot.''Yes, it’s a bit of a challenge to climb up 5,000 stairs, but it’s well worth it.\xa0 Even the red-faced couple I ran into about a half hour from the top, worried they wouldn’t make it, arrived in plenty of time to see the sunrise.''And my, what a truly marvelous sunrise it was.''it’s starting''and getting gore impressive…''Truly gorgeous''It has risen''The walk down, given all those stairs, was a challenge for the knees, but on the high of the sunrise, I barely felt it.\xa0 Once I was done with the steep stairs, I leaped, ran, and bounded the rest of the way down.\xa0 Total time was about 6 hours – 4 of which were spent climbing, 2 of which were spent waiting for and then admiring the sunrise.''Some local ladies asked me to take their picture (and then promptly asked for money, which I sincerely didn’t have on me)''Do it yourself:''The base town for Adam’s Peak is Dalhousie where there are guesthouses and restaurants''Dalhousie can be accessed by direct bus from Colombo or Kandy during the peak season.\xa0 During the off-season, it must be accessed via Maskeliya which can be reached by taking a bus from Hatton where there are both busses and railway stops''If you want to take a tuk-tuk from Hatton, thereby avoiding overcrowded and uncomfortable busses, the going rate is about 1,000 Rupee (about $8)''The tuk-tuk driver will probably bring you to a guesthouse.

Then, the economy skyrocketed due to the U.S. investment-induced post-war industrial revolution.''This changed social structure from a mainly agricultural, communal culture where people would trade goods directly to what we now have in modern times — a culture where people work in offices and have the money to just buy bread at stores. \xa0The personal interaction is erased since the purchase is made not from the individual who made the bread, but from an impersonal store shelf, most likely made by machine somewhere far away.''Stefano can remember a time when his neighbors\xa0would get together to make bread in large batches, each bringing ingredients and sharing in the finished product. \xa0He spoke about it with nostalgia, clearly preferring old times where food was made with natural ingredients and an element of trust was still there, as opposed to now when chemicals replace certain ingredients and conglomerates make our food.''Cheese and meats made and preserved in the traditional way''Yet, one of the last strongholds of this communal living still remains in Emilia Romagna. \xa0There are still some autonomous communities on a small scale where everyone in the community still interacts and depends on each other.''In the countryside towns dairy farmers sell fresh cheese to their neighbors, made organically with hormone-free cows. Artisans sell directly to the consumer down the road instead of through a middleman. \xa0Steeped in tradition, this humanizes food and other items needed for daily life and fosters relationships more easily.''Stefano brought all of this up to highlight the Importance of walking to conduct daily life. \xa0The very trails we aimed to trek on that day are thousands of years old – some even pre-Christ.''There are still traces of civilization from back then along the walking paths today.''The gorgeous countryside''It is no surprise to see people regularly waving and saying hello to each other in these small towns. \xa0There’s an element of openness and friendliness that is missing from large megatropolises like New York, for example, where people are more sealed off to interaction with each other.''Just being in this area and wandering these hills creates a feeling of going back several hundred years because everything is still on a smaller scale the way it used to be. There are no mega farms or conglomerates and there are literally thousands of walking paths that people still use today in the way that they have for countless generations.''I really felt transported back to those ancient times, traveling through hills where ancient life and modern times intersect.''The other fascinating aspect was the natural diversity and constantly changing micro climates, the same thing that had me so enamored with''New Zealand''. \xa0With so many trails there’s tons of variety. The big selling point for me, of course, is the lack of other tourists. \xa0One could walk for days and not encounter another one.''Sadly, we didn’t get much opportunity to test them out given the heavy rains, but I still very much enjoyed being transported back in time.''Thanks to Stefano and''Trekking Italy Emilia Romagna''for hosting me via''Blogville Emilia Romagna''.

Justice, Karma, that evil and good are just two sides of one story. It’s a long story. And yes, I do believe in magic. So once I heard about Sak Yant, the magic tattoo, I knew that’s for me. I can’t remember when I first heard about it, but I remember exactly the moment when I decided I’m really going to get one. It was in Chiang Mai, I was talking to the chef of our hostel about my back tattoo and he showed me his tattoos. They were beautiful. Sak Yants. And he told me about the spirit of Sak Yants, what they mean to him and encouraged me to go to the same temple where he got his ones. And I knew I’m going to do this.''And I did.''”''Her Ha Taew Sak Yant''Read more about our experience getting tattooed together on''Yvonne’s blog''.''Matt’s Story:''Matt actually went with me when I got my second tattoo. \xa0Our reasons for getting the tattoos were pretty similar. Here’s what inspired him to get his:''Luang Pi Nunn applying a tattoo''“My very first tattoo''was engraved into my flesh''by a practicing Buddhist monk in the traditional Sak Yant style. While I’m a fan of many Buddhist principles, I don’t practice the religion. So why did I get it? I’d been considering a tattoo of some sort, but could never figure out what. My lifestyle revolves around seeking out new travel adventures, so when I learned about the Sak Yant process, I was intrigued. Why not let a practiced Thai holy-man pick an ancient design and apply it using a traditional method?''The Gao Yord protection symbol currently on my back will always remind me of the day I sat on a dirty monastery floor for 4 hours with 40 locals waiting nervously for my turn to be''jabbed''blessed.''An incredible and unusual travel experience that will remain etched into my mind, as well as my back, forever''.”''Matt’s fresh tattoo''Ian’s Story:''Ian was my guru for getting my tattoo. I followed his directions and advice completely, and made sure to see his ink for myself before getting mine. \xa0His beautiful story takes it another level deeper:''Ian receiving his tattoo''“I don’t have many tattoos – I should probably say *yet* – so finding something that has profound significance to me was very important. I have one from college, which marked a transitional period in my life, and it’s the Japanese equivalent of Chi, representing balance in your mind, your body and your soul. More than a decade later and I found myself living in Thailand.''A possible career been and gone, and a brand new life just being started. Already there was an appeal to have a marking symbolic to this transition. Then the unthinkable happened. During a trip to Thailand to visit me in my new quarters, my father suffered an irrecoverable cardiac arrest. My family joined together to support one-another here in Bangkok while doctors passed numerous tests. For my brother, it was his first time leaving North America. Not the introduction to my life-long passion I would have wished upon him, but significant none-the-less.''We decided, while here together, to get a specific Sak Yant.''We took''a wild trip involving minivans, motorcycle taxis'', sun-rises over rice patties and a village-based Buddhist temple, Wat Bang Phra. It was there that a buddhist ajarn (tattoo master) monk gave us our sacred bamboo tattoos. They were of the symbol “Paed Tidt”, which looks like a compass, composed of the 8 reincarnations of Buddha, one for each point of the compass.''It is said that this Sak Yant offers protection “from the 8 corners of the universe” to anyone who is blessed with it.''It is ideal for travellers, and of course very significant to not only the transition of my new life abroad and all the travel entailed in my life, but also for the transition my family would now go through.''The process and beautiful result''Our Sak Yant experience was incredible.''It was raw. It was sacred. It was unifying''. I am so grateful I was able to experience that with my brother, and know that we are forever connected with the protection of the Paed Tidt, no matter how far our geographical locations separate us.”''Tawny and Chris’ Story:''Thanks to Chris for giving me info on the healing process after getting my tattoo. \xa0The video these two made of their experience is a great introduction for anyone curious about the method:''Chris’ Sak Yant''“It’s an inescapably seductive story. The idea of traveling to a distant land and asking for a blessing. No paltry blessing either, a blessing that is etched into your skin for eternity. For me the experience gave me so much more than just the story,''it gave me a compass to live by''. The blessing I received was translated for me and reminds me of the virtues I value.

Here’s the breakdown:''Accommodation:''There were far fewer dorms available in Indonesia as compared to countries that are more firmly on the banana pancake (Read: Southeast Asia backpacker) trail, such as''Laos'',''Cambodia'', and''Thailand''. \xa0Naturally, for a solo traveler, this forces the costs to go up. \xa0The cheapest place I stayed was in''Bukit Lawang'', a trekking town in Sumatra, for only 50,000 Rupiah (USD$5) per night for my own room with a balcony on the river, ensuite bathroom, and a mosquito net around the bed without holes – trust me, this was a luxury. \xa0The most I paid was closer to $15 in Java at a guesthouse that had a bit of a monopoly on the area in''Kawah Ijen''.''In general, accommodation in Sumatra was the cheapest, while rooms on Flores and especially Java happened to be a lot more expensive and offered much less bang for my buck.''Transportation:''This is where a budget can me made or broken. \xa0I only had one major (quite major) blunder when getting around Indonesia. \xa0I was so used to the cheap Air Asia flights in''Malaysia'', where I would spent $18 to cross the country, that I didn’t consider how much it would cost me to get from one end of Indonesia in Sumatra, to the other in Flores, in order to make it in time for a SCUBA diving live aboard trip I had booked. \xa0What was the damage? Almost $300 US dollars.''Yeah, ouch.''What’s more, Indonesian airlines don’t allow non-Indonesian credit cards when booking online, so do some research first to know the prices, and then visit a travel agent to book any flights.''Otherwise, I made sure to always take public transportation. \xa0As I mentioned earlier, nobody else seemed to do this, but it was incredibly cheap. \xa0The least expensive bus I took was about 4 hours and cost me $1.40. \xa0I’m not sure why almost nobody else did this, as it wasn’t too difficult and even ended up in some''funny stories''and great interactions with locals. \xa0I must be in about 100 people’s random photos at this point.''*Tip:''Don’t let a tout sell you a ticket. \xa0Pay the attendant on the bus directly. \xa0Even if you’re dropped off outside of what appear to be ticket windows, they take a cut. \xa0Climb onto the bus that is going where you want to go, and you’ll be approached once the bus gets going by an attendant who will quote a price. \xa0Don’t be afraid to say,''“mahal”''(expensive) if it sounds astronomical. In general, a public, non-airconditined bus should not be more than a few dollars. \xa0Also be aware that many people smoke in Indonesia, and even enclosed busses will sometimes have smokers on board. \xa0This is just the reality of overland travel in this country.''Food and Drink:''This is where Indonesia became fabulously cheap. \xa0I often ate meals, especially in Java, for less than a dollar. \xa0The way to do this is to find a''warung''which cater more to locals and serve local foods. \xa0Indonesian food is delicious, so why not eat local?

That said, they were still cheap at anywhere from $8-$15 per night per room. \xa0Also, I had an absolute blast on Gili T and really enjoyed the beautiful volcanos in Java. \xa0It was worth it to pay a little more.''Other Incidentals:''Haggle, haggle, haggle! \xa0Indonesia travel costs can vary widely if the ticket seller thinks he can get more money out of you. \xa0The starting price is never the ending price, and this goes for almost everything. Even posted prices are sometimes negotiable. \xa0At least try, and if you don’t get the price you want, walking away is a good tactic. \xa0You’ll almost always hear, “OK! Come back,” and will get the discounted price you wanted. \xa0In more touristed areas like Bali and Gili T, this will be tougher as many short-vacationers don’t know this and will pay the astronomical prices.''Buy tickets directly from the sellers. Cutting out the middle man always saves money. \xa0Book tours directly which helps avoid scams and is always cheaper.''Lastly SIM cards were ridiculously cheap. \xa0I really don’t know why, but I only paid $3 for 2 gigs of 3G with the 3 network.

The popularity of Muay Thai has now spread worldwide, and attracts a mass of visitors and tourists who visit to watch live bouts.''Although every town or city in Thailand has a Muay Thai stadiums and arenas, the best and largest Muay Thai venues can be found in Bangkok. Bangkok is home to the Lumpinee, Rajadamnern and Channel 7 Stadiums.''Thailand is the birthplace of Muay Thai. If you want to experience an authentic fight, we suggest that you visit one of the three stadiums listed below.''Lumpinee Stadium''Lumpinee Stadium is located at Lumpini Park. This stadium is one of the most well known of all the Muay Thai stadiums in Bangkok. Due to its popularity, this stadium can get very busy and very load. But it’s all part of the atmosphere.''If you are looking to watch a bout in this stadium, tickets will cost between 200 and 2,000 baht. The highest priced tickets will secure you ringside seats.''Fight nights take place on Tuesdays and Fridays from 6.30p.m, on Saturday afternoons between 5 and 8p.m., and Saturday nights from 8.30p.m onward.''Rajadamnern Stadium''Rajadamnern Stadium is the second largest Muay Thai stadium in Bangkok. Fights here are well attended and often crowded. Gambling is legal here and can be located on the second level.''Tickets here are a little more expensive than Lumpinee Stadium and range from 500 to 2,000 baht for ringside seats. They also offer discounted Sunday tickets. If you are going to watch a major event, buy your tickets in advance, as they are known to sell out quickly.''Fights take place more frequently at Rajadamnern Stadium. You can watch bouts on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday from 6:30p.m.''Channel 7 Stadium''Next to the Lumpinee and Rajadamnern Stadiums is the smaller stadium Channel 7, owned and operated by the channel. The fights here are broadcast live weekly. There is normally a good atmosphere at this venue.''You’ll be happy to hear that admission to the Channel 7 Stadium is completely free. Bouts take place every Sunday and third Wednesday of the month. On Sundays, the fights begin at 13:45 PM, and on Wednesdays, the fights begin at 12:00 PM.''These are the most popular stadiums, but as Muay Thai is such a big part of Thailand’s culture, you will no doubt come across a kickboxing match at a local temple or fair. If you are staying in the area for a while, ask at your hotel to see if there are any local matches or events you can attend. These events will have a nominal entrance fee or will be free.''If you get hooked on Muay Thai, it has been known for tourists to stay in Thailand and learn the skills from a master. There are a number of gyms that are open to training foreigners, and it’s a great way to qualify for a resident visa given Thailand’s more strict rules as of late.''YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE''No related posts.''Kawah Ijen was one of the most brilliant parts of my trip so far, which is saying a lot considering that I have now logged about 8 months traveling all over Southeast Asia. It was also a challenge to do solo and independently of a tour, as online information was scarce and Kawah Ijen is a little more off the beaten path.''But I’m simply not a tour person. I almost always shy away from them because they cost more and take away from the local experience. \xa0Though it was definitely done with less ease, I don’t regret my decision to do this independently for a second.''Thankfully for you, I’ve now done the legwork to find the information to make this a bit easier moving forward for the independent traveler.''This is how to do Kawah Ijen without a tour:''Kawah Ijen can be accessed by either Banyuwagi or Bondowoso.

Hire a bicycle taxi for a dollar or two to take you from your hotel to the bus depot.''As for exact timing of the bus departure each morning, it’s tough to say. I was told 7am, 9am, and 10am. Like tr''aveling elsewhere in Indonesia'', departure time probably just varies. I arrived at 9am and waited for only 20 minutes. \xa0As soon as I pulled up at the bus station, everyone knew exactly why I was there and pointed me to the correct bus.''How nice of them.''The ride up took around 2.5 hours as it made frequent stops for supplies. The cost was 35,000 Rupiah, which I thought was a rip-off until running into a fellow independent traveler who was charged 50,000 for the same ride the previous day.''I turned left down the road from the bus stop in Sempol and walked the 1km to Arabica Guesthouse (the intersection will have a sign advertising tourist information). I was honestly a little hesitant to stay there given the''poor Trip Advisor reviews'', and after dealing with the very unfriendly staff that also tried to overcharge me for some noodles (initially quoted 7,500 then demanded 10,000), I stand by my hesitancy. However, since information was hard to come by, I went with that. I have since found out that Campir Guesthouse, closer to the trail entrance, is another option. Hire an ojek (motorbike taxi) from the bus stop to get there for around 30,000 Rupiah – be sure to bargain.''The unsung heros of Kawah Ijen, sulfur mine workers carrying heavy loads of sulfur down the volcano several times per day''Part of the risk of approaching this without a tour is the potential of the rooms being booked out by tours. In this scenario, there are always homestay options. That said, they can be overpriced for what they deliver, so bargain hard on those as well. I found that they would often ask where I was from before quoting a price, determining how much I could likely afford given my home country (hint: America is the WRONG answer).''There are a couple of warungs (small eateries) in town that provide cheap food as well if you want to avoid costly guesthouse pricing for dinner.''Viewing the Blue Flames and Catching Sunrise''Don’t miss this!''I’ve''read online accounts''and met plenty of tourists who didn’t see the blue flames or the sunrise. \xa0Absolutely don’t miss them! The volcano is beautiful but hiking in with the stars, getting up close to the blue flames and viewing the truly stunning sunrise were what made this trip so wonderful and unique.''Ask your guesthouse to organize an ojek driver for 1am (2am would probably also be alright although it would be pushing it). Cost should be anywhere from 40-60,000 Rupiah. Again, bargain on this. The driver will drop you at the entrance where you will be approached by offers for guides. A guide really isn’t necessary as the path is obvious.''Hiking in with the stars made it a really beautiful experience. The initial 1km was a steep climb but it evened out after that. Upon reaching the volcano crater a rocky and steep path leads down to the blue flames. Plenty of workers are already there preparing to carry down their first load of sulfur. Some will attempt to lead your way and will ask for a few thousand rupiah in exchange for guiding you. This may be worth it given their unique knowledge – especially if you’re amongst the first to arrive, as I was.''He’s here to help''Blue flames!!''Sulfur clouds and glowing blue''Up close (probably a little closer than is safe, being honest) to the blue flames''Hike back up and farther along the crater rim after you have your fill of the blue flames.

Save for a couple other tourists, I almost had the sunrise vista and the blue flames all to myself.''So''this''is what I passed by in the dark''Upon reaching the end of the trail, there were plenty of private busses and ojek drivers around. One can either catch a public bus back down to Bondowoso and then take a bus from the terminal onward from there to one’s next destination, or organize transport with the private tour companies staying in your guesthouse to Bali at the end of your trek, if that is your next desired spot. I ended up hiring an ojek to bring me back to Arabica where I slept, departed around 12:30pm for the public bus, and waited at the stop. I was told it would arrive anytime between 1pm and 4pm. In the end, I was offered a ride and ended up hitch hiking back to Bondowoso,''but that’s a story for another time''.''Do Kawah Ijen, and do it independently.

Kazbeg and Tsminda Sameba''At 5,033m, Mount Kazbeg is the third highest mountain in Georgia.\xa0 Particularly adventurous travelers might be interested in climbing the mountain with a guide.\xa0 Even for less serious trekkers, though, there are plenty of hiking opportunities nearby, ranging from an easy stroll to the climb up Mt. Kazbeg itself.''Near the base of mountain, the village of Kazbegi offers a perfect place to relax and to use as a starting point for hikes around the area.\xa0 The village is also near Tsminda Sameba, also known as the Gergeti Trinity Church.\xa0 At an altitude of 2,170m, this church is a popular destination for travelers, as well as a stopping point for those setting out on linger hikes.''Georgian Military Highway''The Caucasus Mountains are rugged terrain, and only a few roads cut all the way across them.\xa0 The Georgian Military Highway is one of them.\xa0 This 200km-long road runs all the way from Tbilisi to Vladikavkaz in Russia, passing stunning mountain views as well as numerous villages and historic sites.\xa0 Russians constructed this highway in the early 19''th''century by Russians, but the route itself has been used for trade and by invading armies for thousands of years.''Children in Georgia''Anunari Fortified Castle''One of the top destinations along the Georgian Military Highway, Anunari Fortified Castle is about 45 miles from Tbilisi.\xa0 This huge complex contains a couple of churches, as well as the remains of the walls and towers that once protected the castle.\xa0 It’s free of charge, and visitors are given pretty much free reign to explore the ruins.''Uplistsikhe''Located near Gori, in Eastern Georgia, Uplistsikhe is also known as The Fortress of the Lord.\xa0 It dates all the way back to the 16''th''century BC, making it one of the oldest cities in Georgia. \xa0What’s even more remarkable about Uplistsikhe is that this ancient city is carved entirely out of rock.''In Georgia’s ancient kingdom of Kartli, Uplistsikhe was an important religious and political center and a thriving town.\xa0 Many of the buildings are still intact, and you can see Christian and Pagan architecture existing side-by-side, as well as the stunning workmanship that went into creating an entire city out of stone.''Georgian Wineries''Georgia is famous for its wine – and for good reason!\xa0 The fertile land of Georgia has been used for wine making since 8000BC, and archaeologists have found evidence that this region is where grapevines were first cultivated.\xa0 With its long history of wine making, Georgian wines are ranked as some of the best in the world.\xa0 In particular, Georgia’s Kakheti region is home to some of the most famous wineries, many of which offer wine tasting for guests, as well as a look at Georgia’s unique method of wine making.''Skiing at Bakuriani and Gudauri''With the Causasus Mountains nearby, Georgia is an excellent place for winter sports enthusiasts. Bakuriani and Gudauri are two of the most popular ski resorts.\xa0 Gudauri is located about two hours by car from Tbilisi, and offers slopes rising to 2,196m above sea level.\xa0 Bakuriani is another ski resort, near Borjomi, with slopes rising up to 1,700m.''Sighnaghi Village''Love this photo of Carrie’s''If you’re interested in seeing what life in a Georgian village is like, head to the tiny village of Sighnaghi.

It can be done.\xa0 I know, because I did it.''Accommodation:''This will be the cheapest part of Cambodia if you work it right.\xa0 Stay in dorms whenever possible and accept that you most likely won’t have air conditioning or hot water.\xa0 This is pretty irrelevant as you will probably only be in your dorm while you’re sleeping, and it’s so hot in Cambodia, there’s really no need nor desire for a hot shower.''Transportation''Some great ways to cut corners include taking a''push-bike''vs. a tuk-tuk or motorbike, when possible.\xa0 One example is touring''Angkor Wat''.\xa0 A tuk-tuk costs $15/day while a bike costs $2.''Another way to cut corners is to walk out to the street to hail a tuk-tuk as opposed to allowing your guesthouse to do it for you.\xa0 You’ll also be much better off if you make friends with the driver and negotiate fair rates.\xa0 Always haggle.\xa0 One can also go even cheaper and take moto taxis.\xa0 I never took a standard cab, as most towns don’t have them.''The same logic applies for heading directly to the bus station to book tickets vs. through your guesthouse or a tour operator. \xa0Most busses ran anywhere from $3 to $8 for anywhere from 2 to 9 hours worth of driving.''Food''Western food can be found for anywhere from $2 to $6 for a standard meal. Breakfast is available at any time of the day.\xa0 Street food isn’t as prevalent as in, say, Thailand, but it is still easy to find and relatively cheap.\xa0 Although, you might not really know what you’re eating, and you’ll need to be a little adventurous.''Cheap vs. Expensive Places in Cambodia''Cheap: The cheapest place I stayed at was''Banlung'', just south of Laos.\xa0 My guest house cost $2 for the dorm, but I also watched as two rats, followed by a frog, hopped across my guest house floor.\xa0 You can also stay in Sihanoukville practically for free, but I chose the less-seedy''Otres beach''and only paid $3/night for a basic room with mattress, mosquito net, and a shared bathroom.\xa0 It’s all you really need.''Expensive: The islands, particularly''Ko Ta Keo''and''Koh Rong'', were the most expensive.\xa0 Bungalows run anywhere from $15 to $25/night, but often accommodate several people.\xa0 This is a little tougher as a solo traveler, but one can find friends to bunk with.''Larger cities like''Siem Reap''and''Phnom Penh''also tend to cost a bit more than the smaller towns, but one can still easily find $5-$6 dorms.''Other Incidentals''As any long-term traveler will tell you, alcohol eats your budget up quickly. \xa0I could have spent about $100 less had I not imbibed on $1 Angkor beers (but how can you resist?!).''What’s more, I spent about $10 total on unlimited 3G data for my iphone.''Now THAT is a steal.''* I did visit Cambodia during what would be considered low season.\xa0 Naturally, pricing was a bit lower during this time.\xa0 I also traded a blog post in exchange for free''SCUBA diving''and accommodation, plus a trek while in Cambodia.\xa0 These all helped me keep my costs in check.''So, in my opinion, though Cambodia is more costly now than it was even two years ago, for example, it is still an absolute budget destination that can easily be done with only $1000 to your name.''Click for a budget breakdown in''Laos''and''Thailand''.''Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever)''Days 44-48''I was sitting across from Ben, the hostel manager at''Vientiane Backpacker’s Hostel''where I had planned to spend only one night to take care of a Thai tourist visa. \xa0I had just connected to the horrendous wifi and had enough time, between loading pages, to get to know him as a Texan who had come to Laos on a whim and picked up a job at the hostel.''Feeling a little more blunt than usual, I was all “Why in the world would travelers take jobs at hostels in exchange for room and board when the compensation works out to be, like, $2 hourly?

It’s the right thing to do, anyways.''After all, who needs the interwebs when you have the river below your feet, good company all around, and another day of laziness (or biking, tubing, kayaking, etc.) ahead of you?\xa0 Not this girl.
